My understanding is that the main purpose of PoS is governance (i.e., the ability to vote). To vote, some amount of DCR must be locked up, and the voting power is proportional to that amount. However, the coins are now locked up, and won't be unlocked for a stochastically determined amount of time. 

Thus, it seems that to participate in governance, a user must give up the ability to actually use the coins to buy things for a significant amount of time in the future. Therefore, people who are actually using decred as a currency (rather than as an alternative for something like a certificate of deposit) are unable to stake, and thus unable to participate in governance.

This seems like a bad set of incentives -- a user is incentivized to give up the ability to use decred as an actual currency in order to participate in governance.

From the documentation, my understanding is as follows:  

- I would bid on ""tickets"";
- If I win the bid, the ticket is allocated to me and I can be expected to be called to make a ""vote""  on average 30 days after acquiring the ticket, could take longer, could take shorter however 30 days is the expected mean time;
- My coins cannot be traded or used in any other way while I hold the ticket and am waiting to be called to vote;
- After making the vote, I can expect to be rewarded the PoS Vote, DCR on this page: https://dcrstats.com/subsidy;

So according to dcrstats.com the average ticket price is: 60.51 DCR. Last block PoS reward is 1.4595 DCR.

Just like gold is today, you cant transact in everyday form.  I see that as a non-issue, im fine with BTC becoming just a store of value, perhaps for trasanactions like house purchase, or trasnferring millions of dollars, stuff that doesn't need to be settled immediately or point of sale systems.

-Monero wants to be the ultimate anon coin.  I think there will be a market for such anon coin, however, i think this feature alone will prevent it from ever being used as a legitimate world currency-fully accepted by countries and governments.  If you run a business, you need to have transparency in your business dealings, for IRS reasons alone.

-ETH is smart contract platform.  As buggy or hackable as it may be its the smart contract king, for now.

-DASH is cash.  Its in the motto, it wants to be the new digital cash.  The devs want to make DASH so easy to use even your grandma will be using, its working to market the coin to the masses.  At some point competing with VISA and MASTERCARD for everyday purchases. 

What is DCR?  Does it want to be a store of value?  Anon coin? or digital cash?  I dont mention anything related to smart contracts because ive not read or heard anything about DCR wanting to become the new smart contract platform.  There will be room in the crypto for many coins that will live for the long haul, and those coins will probably be specialized and the best at what they do, but i dont think there will be jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none.

Did this ever come to pass? Does anyone have any further information on this topic?

I'm a bit disappointed in the visibility of this community and the visibility of the currency itself. Fundamentally, Decred is one of the best cryptocurrencies on the market. It is very easy to argue for its value and its host of advantages, yet many involved in the crypto community are still relatively unaware. A lot of the currencies with bigger market shares pale in comparison to DCR when you look at the fundamentals alone, so it seems like they may be propped up by better PR and awareness campaigns. Part of my career involves advertising so knowing some of the details of the costs involved, it makes me think much more could be done with the funds from the dev premine and the dev subsidy. 

Additionally, I think it could help for some of the conversation to move away from Slack and the official Decred forum and into more public/visible places like this subreddit. An outsider could look at this subreddit and quickly move onto the next when they see little to no activity comparatively. 

Overall, I'm not trying to complain. I just want us to share some ideas on how we can constructively move forward with igniting the Decred community and bringing more people into the fold.

It's hands down the best governance model in crypto's, and with Lightening Network adoption and privacy on the cards I believe it's making all the right moves.


I've been accumulating DCR for a while now, and finally got off my lazy ass and decided to figure out the whole ticketing system. I ran into a few speed bumps and thought I'd share my thoughts with the intent of helping us all improve decred.

My main piece of feedback is that the ticketing system, while being an outstanding staking/governance system, is a little difficult to grasp and use, especially when we're looking at widespread adoption down the line.

I think the main challenges are:
1. Explaining how the system works conceptually;
2. Further automating the ticket purchasing and voting process.

For #1, I tried to come up with an analogous system or concept that's more widely understood, and the first thing that came to money is to describe the ticketing process as some kind of ""fixed term deposit"" which entitles you to voting rights and interest on those funds.

For #2, a great start would be a GUI wallet with the closest thing to a ""one-click button that automates stake pool entry, ticket purchasing and voting. 



*edited to add #3 and further discussion

One more point:
3. Ideally we would want the automated ticket purchasing process to be able to run without dcrwallet being open.

I could be wrong, however I currently understand that dcrwallet needs to be open for ""ticketbuyer"" to automatically purchase tickets. Removing that requirement would be a great step towards ease of use.

Thinking about it all more, I could be moving away from some of the core ideas of rewarding participation. So I guess the question is ""what is a fair staking reward for someone who doesn't want to participate in votes and doesn't want to keep dcrwallet open, and how do we automate receiving that reward for them""",NA,"6sv430",NA,0,NA,"false",1504666606,"false","self","t5_30fo6","false","serene24","","false","true",NA,"/r/decred/comments/6sv430/feedback_from_a_new_adopter/",NA,"",NA,"Feedback","",0,0

It has very capable and experienced developers and a massive mining network. It also has a problem, of sorts. Consensus. There is no viable way in the Bitcoin protocol to determine consensus. This has been demonstrated over the past few years during the “scaling debate” which has mainly occurred over Twitter, Reddit, meetings in which people agree but don’t follow through, and the bitcoin dev mailing list. Development and upgrades to the network have been stalled just at the point in time when Bitcoin should shine. The mechanism that Satoshi put in place and the way in which it was released will never be duplicated. But, as with everything that is introduced you either keep making it better or you will get usurped.

Decred is more than Bitcoin 2.0, it is the introduction of the “Cypherpunk Corporation”. A cypherpunk is “a person who uses encryption when accessing a computer network in order to ensure privacy, especially from government authorities.” A corporation is defined as “a company or group of people authorized to act as a single entity (legally a person) and recognized as such in law.”  Now as has been famously stated before “code is law” and the “law” that is followed is Decred’s consensus code. Decred is actively developing the means by which it can become a fully functioning, yet safe DAO “decentralized autonomous organization”. 

But what is the actual product of Decred? Currently, I would argue that most cryptocurrencies initial use case is as a store of value. As such, in terms of dollar value, I think Decred has done quite well. There, we have our “product”. A very small base value to begin with, but let’s also add in that the chain is “unforkable” by bad actors. As a corporation, we now need workers that “produce” this product. Those “workers” are the miners and their offices are the mining pools. When blocks are found, rewards are given for the blocks and the workers get payment. But wait, there’s more… Now as an “investor” in Decred I should expect something in return for having bought their coin. I can participate in “mini board votes”, which occur every block, and by doing so I earn a modest return on my investment. This is how the investors control how the network moves and how network upgrades are made. 

I would appreciate any comments and feedback is always welcome to help improve. Thanks!

2) We are all responsible for the marketing. Decred is an open-source community project that is based on decentralised decision making. Grassroots movement and shared responsibility are the more important than centralised authorities, especially in the cryptocurrency space.

**sambiohazard**: he is generally pessimistic about altcoins

**praxis**: Yes, he's a notorious Bitcoin maximalist. 

**simmysong**: what’d he say about decred?

**ty13r**: weren't you watching the show? @jimmysong 
I saw your name in the chat

**jimmysong**: I popped in just now
but then he wasn’t talking decred anymore so i left
I also didn’t say anything

**ty13r**: @jimmysong good to know :slightly_smiling_face:

**jrick**: oh i found my next avatar

**ty13r**: @jimmysong he talked about the chart for a minute.  I'm not sure what else he said prior.
not sure what he said after either lol

**go1dfish**: sounds like he’s fundamentally opposed to proof of stake

**sambiohazard**: he just said there is probably downside on price, and maybe its warranted for goo future growth
he hadnt researched/read about fundamentals
so pure TA

**ty13r**: sounds like he won't like decred because it's has a form of proof of stake built into the protocol
sounds like he hates all ideas related to proof of stake

**pvtwarren**: he hates all ideas that are not bitcoin pretty much

**ty13r**: except monero and ethereum i guess

**pvtwarren**: he doesn't hate ethereum?

**ty13r**: apparently monero and ethereum deserve to be #2 and #3
not sure
I don't see why he wouldn't

**pvtwarren**: back in January I remember he was still calling it a scam
maybe I remember incorrectly

**cryptocasca**: His problem with PoS guys is the ""rich people control the blockchain"" problem
He told me himself

**go1dfish**: since when is mining cheap?

**cryptocasca**: He just needs to hear how our devs got around that
I'm not agreeing. Obviously. I'm just saying he thinks of PoS is a system where it's the rich people who control the direction of the coin and proletariat eat the crumbs

**dustinb**: Congrats on the news y'all - what do you think this trend means for the industry at large?

**ty13r**: Well I'm not exactly sure we really differ. People who hold a lot of decred and stake it, directly control the future of the blockchain.

**cryptocasca**: I'm not agreeing. Obviously. I'm just saying he thinks of PoS is a system where it's the rich people who control the direction of the coin and proletariat eat the crumbs
The more decred you stake the more say you have.

**cryptocasca**: There's a cap though @ty13r on the ticket amount that can exist

**ty13r**: No
That's what the sdiff algo does

**cryptocasca**: Well not a hard one
Right

**ty13r**: I think that's nice though
Anyone can participate at any time
With enough funds of course

**cryptocasca**: That's not how he spins it. And we need to combat that mentality. He thinks if you're just a mega whale and buy a bunch of coins that you control the show. That essentially DCR is a system run by whales not people

**davecgh**: So, regardless of the specifics here, I think this is very likely going to be one of those cases where there will simply be a fundamental difference of opinion on the topic. While a lot of people love to rail on the rich as being evil (while simultaneously wanting to be rich -- the hypocrisy there is quite amusing), the fact of the matter is people with more skin in the game have more incentive to keep their stake more valuable.  Loving it or hating it won't change the facts.

**cryptocasca**: Yes. I agree.

**ty13r**: Yep.

**cryptocasca**: I think the staking aspect is important here.

**ty13r**: But same can be said for PoW mining

**cryptocasca**: The locking up for 28+ days

**ty13r**: Buy more miners, you have more say.
Well also just like PoW mining anyone can participate at any given time.
And people are getting paid for putting skin in the game
142 days is a long time in crypto land
Which is the period it takes for a ticket to expire.

**dustinb**: The problem isn't just that the rich have control, it's that the rich get richer. PoS is similar to compound interest.

**go1dfish**: the power over traditional bitcoins is in the mining hardware and that is not specific to the currency they back, which is why you have worries about bitcoin forks attacking each other

**coin_artist**: But also earlier contributors who earned decred build the grassroots community

**go1dfish**: @dustinb I think that’s a large aspecting driving anti-pos perception
but it applies similarly to mining hardware

**dustinb**: Ya @go1dfish - the combination of long term staking + PoW changes things, I need to think more on it.
Tendermint's solution has always been the credible threat of hard fork if anyone's stake gets too big.

**go1dfish**: but mining also ends up specifically favoring some people due to external factors like power pricing

**davecgh**: The other thing here is something which doesn't exist yet, so it's completely understandable why it's not considered, but there is a huge difference between *hard-fork* voting and proposal voting.

**dustinb**: Proposal wouldn't solve it.
The non-majority would have to hf.

**ty13r**: I believe this is another reason why 60% of the reward goes to PoW

**davecgh**: Hard fork voting is changing the rules.  It's the kind of thing where you could destroy the currency if you aren't careful.  That, in my opinion, should consequently very much have a high barrier to entry.  Proposals, on the other hand, should definitely have a lower barrier to entry and thus would be much more inclusive.

**dustinb**: Ya - that's the exact reason I like decred, save the hfs for the big stuff.

**davecgh**: These things are not the same and they shouldn't be treated as such.  Again, this is my own opinion.  I'm sure not everyone agrees.

**ty13r**: @davecgh but how will you differentiate them economically?

**davecgh**: e.g. you wouldn't need a full ticket to vote on proposals, but you would for HFV.

**ty13r**: You might split tickets 32 times, but 1 ticket is still worth 32 votes.

**davecgh**: On the HFV side, yes.  However, you can count them however you want on the proposal side.  It's l2.
You don't need to weight them the same.

**ty13r**: So a split ticket weight might have the same weight as non-split ticket?
But if that's the case couldn't someone stake their funds with splits to get more votes?
Without some sort of identity system it seems difficult to prevent Sybil attacks in that case.

**davecgh**: I'm spitballing here, so don't take this as gospel or anything, but you could definitely look at the snapshotting tickets and see there are 40960 tickets in total and those tickets are split up such that there are 163,840 participants.  So, when you do the proposal system vote, the majority is required to be X% of 163,840.  Meanwhile, the on-chain HFV is still 1 ticket = 1 vote. 

**dustinb**: I like making it difficult to hf, but is the goal to make it impossible?
Not only does that goal technically seem unlikely but aren't there some advantages to hf when we have very serious disagreements within a network about how to proceed?

**davecgh**: It's not impossible at all.  There is a very nice distribution of holders.

**ty13r**: We're referring to the proposal system vote right now

**dustinb**: ah.

**ty13r**: Basically the signaling mechanism for work and spending funds.

**davecgh** : The other thing to keep in mind is that the l2 system can be wildly different if we so choose.  You can create HLTCs to locked up funds for ""layer 2"" tickets that can potentially have arbitrary division.  You don't have all of the limitations as the on-chain system.

**ty13r**: The HF vote makes it real.
@dustinb we just had what should have been a contentious vote that passed with ease surprisingly.

**davecgh**: Then, you still have demonstrable skin in the game, just much much less for participating in the lead-up to a hard fork.  However, the actual hard fork vote, a.ka. the thing that actually changes the rules, will, necessarily, use the on-chain system.
Again, I totally get this is rather abstract right now since it isn't fully built out and mostly just still in our heads.

**ty13r**: But doesn't attacking the l2 system pose a larger risk?
Definitely :slightly_smiling_face:
It's like controlling the seeds
And the hf vote is like controlling when to harvest 
If the seeds never get planted there will never be anything to harvest
I'm all in favor of lowering the barrier to entry, but increasing the favor of Sybil attacks seems tough to juggle if tickets can have a different weight on the l2 system.

**davecgh**: Well, people with more skin in the game will still have more influence.  So, the majority would still win in that case.  It just means it allows more inclusivity, which I think we all desire.

**ty13r**: Yeah I think that's fair.
@davecgh so could the proposal system have completely separate tickets not related to the HF tickets?
For example...

**davecgh**: If we so desire, absolutely.

**ty13r**: I have a bunch of decred that I'm not HF staking
But there's a proposal vote going on that I want to vote for
I lock up tickets in the l2 vote for a week (no reward) and get my funds back after the vote has concluded

**davecgh**: You'd need to think through the adversarial cases as we've done with the on-chain system in order to prevent the case where you vote, all of your locked funds immediately unlock, and then you dump.  So, you'd want some type of randomness factor in there to prevent gaming of it.

**ty13r**: People HF staking still got to vote as well, but so did I without having to lockup my funds for a longer, unknown period of time.
What do you mean by dump?

**davecgh**: However, from a pure perspective of whether or not it's possible, you can definitely have a different ruleset.  For example, one of the biggest differences, everything else aside, is that the voting period duration will be much faster.  Rather than taking a full month, only having 5 votes per block, etc, in the proposal system, the vote would go on for, say a week, and so long as you own a ticket, you can vote whenever you want within that period.  Notice how that ruleset is entirely different already.
I personally can envision a need for differing voting periods too.  There will very likely be time-sensitive things that need to be voted on more or less immediately and maybe they are only 2 days.  On the end of the spectrum, perhaps there are things that need longer than a week. 

**moo31337**: murmurs something about how not interesting ticket splitting is

**davecgh**: By dump I mean something like ""Lock up a bunch of coins, vote down some proposal, all of my coins immediately unlock, sell all of my coins"".  If you can do that, you no longer necessarily have any incentive to vote according to increasing your holding's values.

**moo31337**: you really dont want my raw opinion on it

**davecgh**: That doesn't apply to the on-chain system because you can't snap vote.  Your coins are locked, potentially for months, and you can't influence when they unlock at all.  So, if you try vote in a way that would decrease your holding's value, you would be doing so to your own detriment. 

**ty13r**: Let's hear it @moo31337

**Davecgh**: [I can sum it up easily!](https://slack-files.com/T0NRMDTJQ-F6M7RAZTN-745f49b477) 

**ty13r**: That's what she said

**moo31337**: @davecgh nailed it

**ty13r**: Yeah splitting seems like it has a lot of obstacles

**moo31337**: I super dont want to write that code

**ty13r**: @moo31337 assuming increasing the ticket pool size was easy (which I know it's not and could hurt the network) would you be in favor of that?
Also increasing votes per block proportionately of course

**jy-p**: I wouldn't from a on-chain footprint perspective
having a ""ticket split"" similar to a stock split would be a ton of work
even having 32 split would lead to a massive footprint for offchain votes in the proposal system
let's say you have 100 B for each vote in the proposal system, then take 100 B x 40,960 = ~4 MB for the proposal vote
multiply that by 32 to get ~128 MB of offchain data to track for proposals
this is one proposal too
we'll be experimenting with ways to shrink this footprint soon, so this constraint may improve substantially with time

**ty13r**: Yeah and on chain votes are even bigger

**jy-p**: exactly
imo, the real solution to the ticket price barrier is to allow tickets to be purchased via a variation on LN

**davecgh**: Agreed, and that's why I was talking about l2 tickets above.

**ty13r**: how do you keep people from getting more voting rights though?

**davecgh**: You don't.  Just like in the on-chain system.  If you're willing to lock up more funds, you get more influence.
However, it allows ""smaller fish"" to participate too.  They just have influence proportional to their stake.

**ty13r**: But if you own 51% of a ticket you can vote it however you want
So you could turn 100 tickets into more tickets

**davecgh**: Oh, I see your confusion.  Yeah, your talking about buying partial tickets.  We're talking about just having more tickets period.

**ty13r**: Ahhh ok sorry
So more tickets...but anchored through the LN

**davecgh**: No worries!  Like I said, abstract stuff is always fun to discuss for this reason!
Right.

**ty13r**: I like it.

**jy-p**: there are a variety of approaches we could take, e.g. fractional voting that is tallied via L2 and rolled into a single ticket
we'll start with the simple stuff and see what we can get done first

**davecgh**: Yeah, one of things you guys might have noticed is we're pretty keen on taking things one step at a time.  Trying to do everything half-assed at once is a recipe for failure, imo.

**ty13r**: So for example you'd have maybe 5 tickets vote directly on chain and 5 tickets vote via LN?
Definitely agree with that

**davecgh**: It might look great on paper when you can tout via marketing that you have X, Y, Z, and a BBQ too!  The reality is that if all of those systems are poorly implemented though, it isn't going to make it long term.

**moo31337**: 40k tickets ought to be enough for everyone
one ticket one vote!!!

**ty13r**: Another reason why I advocate for this project is you guys spend the painstaking time to do things right. So I definitely appreciate the non rush to the finish line mentality.

**moo31337**: oh there is a rush
we just tend not to compromise when it matters
I think we need a code is boss meme

**davecgh**: Right.  We do have quite aggressive timelines.  However, as @moo31337 said, if we have to bump an estimated release date to make sure something is right, that's what we'll do.

**jy-p**: speaking of which, i think we're nearing time for 1.1.0 release. that will include the proposal system backend

**moo31337**: you don’t want my working hours and certainly not @davecgh hours; i dont think anyone understands how @davecgh puts 28 hours in a day

**ty13r**: I know you guys work your asses off.
Feels weird when dave goes offline for a few hours honestly lol
Feels like he's been gone for days :joy:

*reddit thread suggesting name change appears*

**ay-p**: Ahhh that daily ""let's change the name"" thread

**jy-p**: I'm 100% sick of these posts

**ty13r**: lol I was about to say the same thing

**jy-p**: ""I know you're named john, but i think you'd sound much more attractive if you were named &lt;insert name here&gt;""
look at the names of these other major projects - they are beyond retarded

**go1dfish**: you just know it’s going to be a popular proposal when that system is ready.

**davecgh**: I'm actually looking forward to that proposal.  It will be voted down once and for all.
Then, in the future we'll just be able to link to the failed proposal.  No fuss.

decred works as a project name, but it seems a bit clunky as a unit name.

**davecgh**: Well, we probably shouldn't be so dismissive, but after seeing the same thing so many times, it's kind of comical.  What is especially funny is that if you actually followed some of the others that people now claim are ""good"" names, there were the exact same threads about them not being good names too.  Now, they are magically good names though because they're popular.

But a proposal to the DAO gives access to a multiparty review process prior to giving a binary go or no go. The review can be valuable both to the applicant for funding aswell as to DAO participants. In a crowdfunding you as an individual funder might send money away prematurely, but in the DAO the fact that multiple stakeholders are possibly more knowledgable in many areas will help keep your (dev) funds safe and spend them on the right things.

I'll just put forth the possibility here to stakers to delegate voting review to a trusted and knowledgable consultant as an alternative to defaulting to either of abstain/yes/no.

Problems of default yes/no are obvious, but defaulting to abstain will lead to the ability for ""fund coups"" where special interest groups who are the only ones interested in their subject gets a ""yes"" due to all the abstains. This problem will arise once the DAO has so many proposals that you can not find time to review all of them. 

Another solution to avoid coups is that the DAO must be preorganized so that all allowed types of proposals are guranteed to have stake holders reviewing them. The problem then is that these groups might still have a tendency to vote yes to their own interest. 

Perhaps the solution is that you as a staker must be randomly selected to review random proposals?

After accumulating DCR for several tickets you will achieve predictability in your ticket returns if you stake. Unlike when just having one ticket it will not take anything from a day to five months until your first return, practically speaking. Some ticket will arrive earlier than others and in fact you will get a steady-ish stream of income depending on how many tickets you have.

Even if the price just spikes up for a short period this means you wont miss the possibility to sell one or two tickets worth of DCR at the top. This might be enough to completely cover all your buys from this level. And it's cost free passive income from there. 

The other reason to withdraw from exchanges now is that your DCRs are cheap. If you decide you want to stake once the price has gone up the exchange might have restrictions on letting you withdraw that much. They will let you deposit though!

And of course it's always safer to not have crypto on exchange. Just a friendly tip in these harsh times.

A corporation has a distinct structure and means of doing business. In Decred our structure is simple as well as means of doing business. Our Board of Directors is our staking pool, and anyone can become a member of that Board. The means by which we conduct our business is by miners processing blocks on our network. 

Now here is the most important part. The code. The very base layer of text that determines how our network performs. Our “consensus rules”1 are written here. Not in terms that that I, as an average user, can read. No, they are written in the language of the cypherpunks, code. Code is law, and as such the attorneys are the hackers and the coders. It is the language that they understand and can manipulate. Both fight to find holes in the law, one to exploit and the other to correct. The question then must be from an investors point of view “Which Cypherpunnk Corporation has the best attorneys?” Now the cryptosphere is an incredible new place, much like the internet of the past. Unlike the internet of the past, the cypherpunks have learned, they have improved.

My argument of the main use case of a cryptocurrency being a store of value, first and foremost begins here. If I place my value somewhere, I need to be sure that it can’t be taken unless I authorize it. I need to be assured that the rules which protect and give rise to value will not be unfavorably changed during the middle of the game. The users will see to that as the users will not want their store of wealth to deteriorate. I also want to know that it can’t be “forked” and effectively create money from nothing. I also want to have a vote in the way that the corporation is run.

So far, the only crypto I have found that meets my requirements is Decred. I have done my research into their attorneys. They exceed all of my expectations. Their understanding of how crypto works at the code level is among the best in the industry. Once the proposal system is active on the network it will be a huge step forward towards the “cyphocracy”

I think I may have lost around 477 DCR. I used to have my Decred in Exodus wallet but moved that into Paymetheus so I could stake. I wanted to sell some DCR (sorry) and move more back into Exodus.

I thought this meant the send failed, but it may have actually been working. The issue is that I do not know how I can track down what addresses my wallet sent to since Paymetheus does not expose my public address (and the address I sent to initially is a 1 time address, generated by Paymetheus).

First off cryptocurrency has the promise to change the reason for trusting money away from violent threats (ie fiat money) to that of cryptographic security. It's difficult to know all the positive effects of this, but it does seem like a more well functioning society would evolve. 

Secondly cryptocurrency has the possibility to limit the taxation in favour of letting people spend money on the causes and people they choose voluntarily to benefit. No more tax funded deserted roads to ghost towns and amusement parks in the middle of nowhere and forced funding of corrupt politicians. Perhaps instead you can afford solar panels for your roof, a connecting road to the city, clothes for your children or support forestation of the desert, if you wish, and many do. You would be free to send money to the causes and people you believe in. The minds of many would distribute activity arguably better than that of just a few and there would be no increased punishment for being more productive.

Thirdly the printing of money would no longer be possible for an elite few thereby continuously stealing from the poor or anyone really who is not first in line on their pay list.  And you wouldn't need to instantly spend your money before inflation eats them, thereby leading to less wasteful consumerism and more dependable money. 

Cryptocurrencies are really the promise of an improved civilization for mankind, and thereby it's survival chances on or off the rock spinning through space. From a moral standpoint I don't see why it shouldn't be a hot issue in any democratic nation to replace fiat currency with a decentralised cryptocurrency. Perhaps morals aren't guiding the discussions? (yeah, that's rhetorical)

In fact anyone using a fiat currency is supporting violent backing, forced taxation and money printing by the few. So if you're not limiting your use of fiat you should be shamed. In other words, we should be shaming those who don't use crypto. Moral movements are perhaps the most forceful bringers of change there is and Decred in my opinion is the crypto most inline with above imperatives for mankind. 

Coming then to Bitcoin and the recent hard fork. That was by the few elite a printing of new money called Bitcoin Cash. In fact that's the built in way of forking Bitcoin - money printing! It caused great instability in all crypto markets making it undependable. And while they made a lot of money off it when it comes to delivering on the original promise of cryptocurrency, a currency that is not printed by the elite -  they failed! They printed money. And should be shamed for it or they will do it again and again and again for profit.  

Decred forks on the other hand does not print money. And as far as I know it's the only crypto that doesn't. If you have a moral or civilizational vision with the use of cryptocurrencies Decred is the  place to be. 

As far as shaming fiat and Bitcoin users I think that is the right thing to do. Although the saying ""don't shoot the messenger"" exists because... people tend to shoot the messenger! So we shouldn't make these circumstances too uncomfortable for anyone. But the facts are in. Bitcoin is printing Decred is not.

What is the mechanism inherent to Decred that prevents the majority from voting itself to be given more of the value locked inside Decred's blockchain than is sustainable (ticket reward)?   

Is it possible by first voting for a *lower price ticket formula* and then this new ticket majority voting a larger payout back to the ticket holders?    

Or does the time your ticket is locked-up prevent that?  Erosion of value would seem to take a much longer period of time as more and more is extracted out of the ""system"" before it collapses.

Since ""skin-in-the-game"" is reduced with a lower ticket price, does that open the flood-gates to *just-give-me-my-slice-of-the-pie-and-nobody-else-will-notice* mentality?

**joe2100**: We need not just marketing from professional organizations.. but from you. The coinbase talk was one of the biggest things that drove me to put $ into this project. We need you, and the other developers to start getting on big stages, and communicating the value proposition of decred. One of the other strongest selling points is the history of the team.. BTC Suite .. etc..

**davecgh**: That isn't going to happen.
Decred is not a centralized project with a single team of developers, so that approach doesn't make sense.

**solar**: To be successful while being decentralized as we grow, I think we need to focus on the structure and organization of our humans.
It's not bad by any stretch, but it's still tough to figure out who is responsible for what, what is being done, what needs doing, what the proper route is to get something done if someone is so motivated.

**joe2100**: dave
why was jy-p chosen to speak @ coinbase?
why can’t that be done at other paces?
other conferences.
Why can’t you do the same?
you might call it decentralized.. but there are leads when it comes to the code.
and you are it.
Am i missing something?

**davecgh**: So we've already done some shows and jy-p spoke at coinbase and a couple of things as you mention.  I will continue to do some shows and such periodically, but the big thing I think that everyone is missing is that c0 is not Decred.  
I'm the lead Decred dev for c0. The lead when it comes to Decred is the stakeholders.
There are absolutely going to be multiple companies/dev teams working on Decred in the future.  That is true decentralization. 

**joe2100**: What is c0 then, what other stuff does the company do?
any why wouldn’t they promote their projects..
The problem is that stakeholders as a group aren’t good at marketing 
they are good an investing and complaining when shit looks bad

**davecgh**: Yeah, I agree with that and as jy-p said above, the course is being adjusted.  I was just making it clear that we devs aren't interested in being the public rock stars.  It creates hero worship and that is bad for Decred.
We don't need a situation where one of us gets hit by a bus and suddenly the project splinters.

**joe2100**: Ok, there it is.. so you just don’t want the spotlight .. fair enough
realistically though dave, do you think if you got hit by a bus, someone else would be able to pick up the slack?
Just saying, you don’t need to be a rockstar.. but people are looking for leadership.. something.. anything
something that will inspire confidence.. and stakey aint it.

**solar**: Also I think the devs should be allowed to focus on dev'ing... It sucks IMO that the devs have to stop the important stuff they're doing to dick around with marketing. (edited)

**joe2100**: I feel the same way Solar.. but the crypto gig is a bit different than your normal gig

**davecgh**: I mean, _right now_ it would probably be a big blow to the project, but I am just a mere cog in the Decred machine.  We are specifically building Decred out to **not** rely on a centralized dev team.

For the record, I'm not oblivious to what you're suggesting, and for many projects, I agree that is a common tactic used.  However, Decred is not a common project.  We're building something bigger.

**joe2100**: Nobody can communicate that idea better than you though..
+ you are god damn sexy..

**davecgh**: We certainly have to make sure that the community is aware, but there are definitely a lot better communicators than myself out there ��

After rereading that a bit, I want to make sure it is clear what I'm trying to say here is that I don't mind doing shows, communicating on slack (I'm on here every day!), promoting Decred because I really believe in the project, etc.  What I wouldn't want though is building the whole public image of Decred around c0.  That is not at all what we're trying to build.

**joe2100**: I’m 100% with that.. I don’t want you to be vitalik 2.0.. just need to get some real communication flowing from leads.. so people understand this project is serious.
yes, there has been tons of that.. but i feel like its not getting the proper exposure..
I mean.. your interview on Decred Assembly was really amazing.. but has 2k views?
and of those 2k.. how many of them are already invested in DCR
need to get into high visibility venues
and refine the message
compress two hours into a tight 20 - 30 min of hard hitting info about the project

**davecgh**: No doubt the message needs to be cast much wider.

**ingsoc**: Quick update for everyone, will have some more info about progress on the PR/marketing department tomorrow.

When will ticket sharing be ready? Is there a ETA? I'm new to dcr (few months) but i have less than 60 dcr, but I would like to stake and vote.
Or will this take more than 6 months? In that case maybe I will buy more dcr, but I prefer to have multiple coins in my portfolio and I don't have more money to invest.

**haon**: Our [current roadmap](https://blog.decred.org/2017/08/02/2017-Roadmap-Update-1/) is filled until the end of the year

…

**joshuam**: @lte13, @burghout's concern is a valid one - quite a few people I've tried bringing into the fold have been concerned w/ the $1,500+ cost of a ticket.

**ay-p**: People are free to split tickets as they choose now

**moo31337**: grrrr

**ay-p**: Yup

**moo31337**: shocking news: you don’t have to buy a ticket

**solar**: y'all gonna get me fired up... no one has to buy Decred, either! Voting is a core feature of Decred and the more accessible it is the better. I know you guys want Decred to be widely adopted, don't act like my 18 year dumb-ass cousin who wants to spend $500 on crypto but can't afford a ticket can just walk in and implement ticket splitting.

**moo31337**: 1/32 of a vote is 1/32 of a vote; obviously people are in it for the reward but put on a morality veneer

**solar**: voting, reward, morality has nothing to do with it. It's THE core selling point of Decred right now, it should be accessible if you want wider adoption.
subject can outvote me 10,000x, I don't care, because I can still participate in the process.

**davecgh**: In fairness, it is the most interesting thing about Decred currently.  Once there are more things like being able to make proposals (you don't have to actually vote on them to be able to make them -- you can find sponsors and such too), making txns over LN, cross atomic swaps, etc, there will be more selling points, so to speak. 

**ay-p**: Ticket splitting solution will not come from us before LN at least.
That's just the facts

**solar**: I accept that and that's why I don't bring it up anymore unless someone else does first :joy:

**ay-p**: So scream as much as you want, but we're not going to hackily implement something just because we have some vocal members. We'd prefer to do things correctly instead of hastily.
But people are free to work on this as they choose, submit a proposal and get paid

**jy-p**: if dcr was worth 10x what it is, it would be a much more serious problem
solving this with an onchain solution is a crap solution with a crap ux
and hacking on that has a big opportunity cost b/c it will delay everything else

**joshuam**: Sorry got side-tracked before I finished what I was going to say
A price increase is what could make it a concern

**jy-p**: examples - how do the votebits get set in a shared purchase ticket? 
if you're using a stakepool, each user has to make their own fractional payout to the pool
it rapidly becomes a mess

**h0d1**: What if the person who pays the pool fee gets to set the vote bit?

**kandiru**: That would be one way to do it, or a pooled input that all participants pay into, which then goes into the ticket.

**joshuam**: At the moment I'm not too opposed to the price of a ticket, as it sort of ensures that those who have some skin in the game are voting 
But have heard concerns raised for the price quite a bit from people dipping their toes in

**moo31337**: looking at the worth of usd v dcr is a bad metric

**joshuam**: Not to the people buying in ��

**jy-p**: we get that ppl want to be able to stake with less dcr, and that will happen when we have the toolkit to deliver a proper technical solution

**joshuam**: That's fair, was not 'screaming' so to speak, was more joining in on lte &amp; burghout's conversation to mention similar concerns have been raised to me by quite a few people I've tried to bring into the fold
Does not bother me too much, as I'd almost prefer DCR stay under the radar until we're a little further on in the development of the Decred DAO
If I am bombarded, then I'd imagine you guys get is multiple times worse, so I understand it is probably a fairly frustrating question/concern

**jy-p**: one of the harder parts about working on a cc is that you learn very quickly that other ppls' shower thoughts often have many caveats when you try to manifest them in code

**joshuam**: I can imagine. People often assume that what is a simple idea is simple to code

**jy-p**: the other part is that good code necessarily takes longer, so ppl see tons of crap code for stuff that doesn't really work and say ""look, project X is killing it with features A, B and C!"" when in reality that code is total junk

**joshuam**: Monero's wallet issues are probably an example of that

**jy-p**: eth's dao was a perfect example of that

**solar**: @jy-p I agree. I take what you guys say very seriously. I guess big picture though most of the people entering the crypto space now are not coders, they might not know what ""fiat"" means, they have a very different sets of wants and needs from previous crypto users... If we want to attract them we have to adapt. That said I am generally satisfied with how things are going.
@jy-p do we need to form a secret coder death squad to go break other project's code?
or does that come later

**jy-p**: believe me, i see the appeal of having ppl microstaking in IN or CN

**joshuam**: I think @davecgh hit the nail on the head. The ticket price concerns are amplified at the moment as HF voting through staking is probably our most prominent feature at the moment

**go1dfish**: ETH is looking at 1000 ETH minimum for staking btw

**jy-p**: breaking other ppl's code takes time and energy, so it has a similar opportunity cost problem - either you spend time building your own code well, or breaking someone else's crappy code

**joshuam**: @go1dfish I'm not sure if that is the case anymore. But I do remember that being the case about 12-18 months ago

**go1dfish**: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6tj5d0/any_updates_on_ethereums_pos/dllfyd1/

**joshuam**: That's surprising
300k stake is pretty hefty. I do recall a few months ago he released a paper with the stake minimum being closer to 30 ETH

**jy-p**: in the case of the dao, someone with the time sat down and worked out a way to break it b/c 10s of M of USD worth of eth were at stake
if you don't care about building stuff, i expect you could make quite a bit by exploiting other ppl's cc code. trouble is that if you can figure out how to break it, you can probably build it too

**joshuam**: @solar you're right, a lot of newcomers in the space in the last 6 months - it's surprising how few are aware of The DAO
The concerning thing about the majority of the recent entrants (at least as I see it), is they appear to be primarily driven by speculation 
The vast majority of the major subreddits are no longer enjoyable places to be

**davecgh**: Yeah, I do get a bit frustrated by all of that rampant speculation.  I mean people are putting hundreds of millions into tech with fundamentally broken models, and I highly suspect the owners know it.  I say frustrated because I feel bad for them knowing they are going to lose their shirt when it all comes crashing down.  Then it reflects poorly on cryptocurrencies as a whole, which I think we all know have some amazing properties. 

**joshuam**: ^Yup, it also drowns out a lot of the developments that are being made in this space that are truly exciting 
When all the coverage is glorifying outrageous ICO raises 
It's hard to get people to see past the speculative potential of a lot of the projects and actually consider looking into the technical, economic and social potential
The reporting is pretty reckless as well

**solar**: I think there are a lot of behind the scenes deals between different ""coins"", VC's, and journalists.

**joshuam**: I think you are absolutely correct

**h0d1**: What if the person who pays the pool fee gets to set the vote bit?

**hugu**: what is the logic behind that ticket prices is growing little bit at every retarget?

**kandiru**: The pool is above target, and people are buying more than the 5 tickets which are voting each block, so the price will slowly grow until that stops happening.

**hugu**: thanks

**lte13**: @solar : you forgot the """" around journalists lol

&amp;nbsp;

My brother and I just launched a new website, [CoinBerries.com](http://coinberries.com), to help people learn about many of the top cryptocurrencies by providing concise and (hopefully) accurate descriptions for each coin. Right now, the process of learning about new cryptocurrencies is time intensive and typically involves going to multiple sources (e.g., company website, news sources, reddit pages) to get a clearer idea of exactly what each coin does.

&amp;nbsp;

For many casual learners or for people who don’t have the time to look at every coin, it’s difficult to keep up and stay engaged without becoming a bit overwhelmed. To help address this, we’ve created [CoinBerries.com](http://coinberries.com) as an educational resource for people to discover and learn about the top coins traded today in a concise and structured manner.

&amp;nbsp;

To make Coin Berries as useful as possible, we're asking communities around each cryptocurrency for help to ensure the information we present is accurate and relevant going forward. 

&amp;nbsp;

Below you’ll find the current description and category we have listed for Decred on our site and additional pieces of information we plan to add for each coin in the coming days. Given that this community has a lot more intimate knowledge about Decred, we would be extremely grateful for your feedback and thoughts on the descriptions &amp; information provided, the usability / functionality of our website, and ultimately the usefulness of our website overall. Any and all feedback is welcome and we plan to keep you in the loop on any revisions made based on this discussion :)

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks so much!

**dcrd**

This release of dcrd primarily contains improvements to the infrastructure and other quality assurance changes that are bringing us closer to providing full support for Lightning Network.

A lot of work required for Lightning Network support went into getting the required code merged into the upstream project, btcd, which now fully supports it. These changes also must be synced and integrated with dcrd as well and therefore many of the changes in this release are related to that process.

**dcrwallet**

This release focused on fixing several issues related to corrupted spend tracking that would cause double spend errors when sending transactions. All users are recommended to upgrade.

This release also lays the groundwork for more staking features to be implemented in future releases. The wallet now tracks more details about all tickets and the votes or revocations that spend them. In future releases, this can be used to implement highly requested features such as detailed listings of all tickets, votes, and revocations and subsidy calculations.

*Database upgrade notice*

This release contains a wallet database upgrade. Once upgraded, the database can not be used on older releases and downgrading will require restoring from seed or backup. The Decred project recommends ensuring you have access to your wallet seed before upgrading in case a downgrade is necessary.

**Paymetheus**

This release focused on under-the-hood improvements to the backend (dcrwallet) instead of new features or UI changes. Users should no longer encounter double spend or orphan transaction errors sending transactions due to fixes for wallet spend tracking corruption, but a seed restore is necessary to fix already-corrupted wallets.

**decrediton**

This release of decrediton aims to smooth out various issues that users have consistently reported since the release of v1.0.6. Extra care has been taken to ensure that users get as much information as possible to understand some of the inner workings of Decred. But at the same time, ticket purchasing and other features are actively being simplified and refined. We have also added some basic animations instead of the default loading screens. We hope to integrate several pieces of art and animations from our amazing community of artists.

In the coming releases we are expecting the following: Windows releases and a completely revamped on boarding procedure. This release is a step toward realizing those goals.

We have also begun a complete refactor and reorganization of the React components which will be followed by an audit of Redux state usage. This [issue](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/528) describes the end goal of this project. Ideally, we will be able to make the UX/UI development open to all designers, which will allow for a true collborative effort.

**Public Keys**

The file [cmd/dcrinstall/pubkey.go](https://github.com/decred/decred-release/blob/master/cmd/dcrinstall/pubkey.go) contains the decred public key which is used to check the signed manifest in the release. You can compare the contents of this file to what you get from a keyserver to confirm that dcrinstaller is using the proper key.

That presents a problem as we have seen recently with the release of BitcoinCash and the announced fork Segwit2x (The New York Agreement), in that how do you determine which is “The Real Bitcoin”? 

I feel that this is where Decred absolutely has the most value. Decred is, by its very design, “unforkable”. Now before I start getting yelled at, yes Decred hard forks. It is the ingenious design of that on-chain hard fork voting action that keeps it as one blockchain. That one immutable chain is of incredible value. It allows stakeholders to vote on the direction and features added to the code. It gives them the opportunity to be a larger or smaller stake, depending on their optimism of the coins future or how they feel about proposals.

The introduction of the coin with an innovative premine / airdrop combination with 50% of the premine having to be actually purchased ($0.49) by the developers and the other half being openly distributed to up 5,000 participants. The fact that Decred is currently working as it should with its on-chain voting puts it head and shoulders above any competing coin.

The game theory plus the actual working code of this store of value is well above average and I find that for what Decred offers it is extremely undervalued compared to any other governance coin.

Proposals submitted on /r/Decred will necessarily involve wishlist items. But if a well formatted list is created then it may be more easy to quickly filter proposals. Google Docs is another way to do this, but is less ""open"", so response rates will be lower compared to Reddit.

My own Reddit formatting is going to be roughly:

```
Proposal | Pitch | Counter-Pitch

---      | ---   | ---

Text here | Text here | Text here

```

Under Proposal, put the proposal in 140 characters or less.

Under Pitch, pitch it.

Counter-Pitch, why we should reasonably not do this proposal.

These proposals are meant to include your own predictions, so you might list a proposal that you don't personally believe in at all, but if it's one you expect other people will vote for, you might want to get the karma for calling it early.

Now, Reddit is highly vote manipulated. Hence I propose the going policy should be to compile every last submission into a simple text format, e.g. JSON. Then this format could be used for highly efficient proposal scanning.

Reddit is arguably the best platform to pitch early stage proposals for Decred.

In a nutshell, Roger Ver claims high transaction fees are single-handedly responsible for driving the growth of altcoins, which we can all agree are substitute goods to Bitcoin.

But is it really true transaction fees alone are fueling the rise of altcoins as substitute goods?

What *is* a substitute good for Bitcoin, really?

Because if Bitcoin is merely a transaction system, and ONLY a transaction system, then Roger Ver is right on the money. It would logically follow, then, substitute goods to BTC are competing solely on transaction fees, and so transaction fees need to be as close to zero as possible.

But are people *really* investing billions of dollars into BTC because they want to make transactions?

What's clear to me, at least, is digital currency has the ability to make you rich, and this appeal to wealth cuts across all boundaries, whether geographic, demographic or sociographic.

Bitcoin is primarily attractive to investors for its ROI potential. In this sense, the ultimate ""substitute good"" for BTC is one with similar ROI potential. Hence, we should recognize altcoins are competing against BTC on the dimension of *profitability*; ROI.

The beauty of Decred is it has a real world profit model built into the coin via *stakemining*. Stakemining makes Decred the perfect substitute to BTC.

Blockchains like Bitcoin and Decred are essentially publicly traded companies whose product is block space. And Decred is one of the only such blockchains in the world that pays a ""dividend"".

What we have on our hands with DCR is a ""Bitcoin"", except with a fixed income investment component.

This is my second or third post to Reddit. I apologize in advance if I have posted this in the wrong place, i'm tired. Anyways, here it goes:

You know you're truly a geek when you stay up all night on a Friday, only to realize it's 7:30 a.m. but you don't care because you wrote two computer programs that may just change the World!
Introducing, Wimpy CPU Miner and Wimpy GPU Miner. Currently they both Mine Decred CryptoCurrency with a 0% developer fee. Because, why would I charge myself? Lol
It's still in the early stages but I am happy to answer any questions concerning the application. It's essentially designed to take the frustation out of mining a bunch of different currencies. I used Decred as a proof of concept. Thank you for your time and I look forward to the comments!

So, my question is how can decred be so fast as well as cheap? Doesn't it face the spam problem of bitcoin? Is the volume so low compared to bitcoin that storage is not an issue yet?

Points of interest:

* Mostly dedicated to Dash
* Discusses some weaknesses and attack vectors
* Two sketches trying to _formally_ describe ""Dash Election Procedure"" and a generic ""Cryptocurrency Treasury""
* Brief analysis of The DAO governance
* Brief overview of Decred governance

I emphasize formal sketches since I believe any attempt to think about cryptos in more robust categories than just the ""code"" is our chance for less buggy systems.

The overview of Decred is mostly focused on Decred Constitution (the ""Assembly"" and ""Council"" stuff), of which I believe most part is still not in full effect yet.

Perhaps this work can be useful in context of developing the Proposal System.

Some methods might include a way to reverse a transaction/set of transactions via a stakeholder vote (perhaps set at a 66% or 75% threshold), a waiting period for transactions of a certain size, or something similar.

I suspect that unless something like this is in place, it will be remain too dangerous for non-security-savvy users to keep a large fraction of their funds in any cryptocurrency.

Obviously adding a hold time that artificially extends the transaction time, or introducing a way to reverse payments is in some ways counter to the goals of cryptocurrency, but some mechanism seems like it will be necessary in the long term.

Intelligent people in our community spend their energy to write thoughtful and accurate messages which after a week or two fall into the void of Slack free plan and cannot be reused.

Second, less critical but annoying problem with Slack is it is very slow and battery hungry. You may not notice it on Chrome, fast Intel CPU and fast first world Internet. But on less powerful setups it is really noticeable. In fact, I bet you would notice the difference with [Freenode web chat](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=decred&amp;uio=d4) on any machine.

Back in June I [wrote](https://forum.decred.org/threads/slack-archive.5429/) about the only two archiving options known to me:

* http://slackarchive.io/
* home-grown exporting and HTML rendering scripts

Today I found third option: Slarck.com

What is interesting for us is their [Slarck for Open Source](https://slarck.com/open-source/) service.

Quoting from their page:

&gt; * Get storage for 200,000 messages (poke us if you need more)
&gt; * Access to the archives are free: no sign up needed
&gt; * The archive links are all static, messages are available as **plain vanilla html**, i.e. Google, Bing, Baidu, etc. will index them to be globally searchable.

Caring about open source and giving back is a good sign. I haven't checked if Slack itself provides free services for open source projects (which they surely use to earn their money). But based on the sole existance of Slarck I assume they don't.

Next thing is the ""almost real-time automatic updates"". I'll quote the [features](https://slarck.com/):

&gt; Authorize  Slarck.com to access your Slack team and have always up-to-date copy of messages you yourself have access to.

&gt; * Updates are automatic and almost real-time
&gt; * All channels accessible to the Slack user: private and public channels, direct messages and groups (you can choose which types to archive)
&gt; * Message history is limited on Slack's free plan
&gt; * One integration slot is required (out of 10 available on Slack's free plan)

Last thing I'd like to highlight is mobile access (thanks to ""vanilla html""):

&gt; Slarck.com is mobile ready and goes light on your data plans. No apps required to access the archives.

I hope to not appear as their advertising agent :)

Remaining open questions to clarify:

* Double-check with them if it is _really_ free
* Is it possible to export a huge archive accumulated in their database?
* Is it possible to import and merge several past exports from Slack? (I hope admins are doing periodic exports).",NA,"6wqvfg",NA,0,NA,"false",1504737107,"false","self","t5_30fo6","false","serene22","","false","true",NA,"/r/decred/comments/6wqvfg/slack_archive/",NA,"",NA,"Suggestion","",0,0

And maybe a DCR/USD, like&amp;nbsp;

Please, submit requests to list DCR. WE REALLY NEED TO LIST Decred on chinese exchanges if we want to continue growing without being overshadowed by other currencies with similar proposals.&amp;nbsp;

Unfortunately that would make it cost-prohibitive for me right now.

So my question is, are there any DCR giveaways (like some have done with other coins) or other ways to get in the game right now if you can't afford to buy 70 DCR? I searched but didn't really find anything. Or is it just not a good coin for the little guy right now, but possible the ticket prices will go way down in the future?

I don't have much money to put in them, but found this website:

[earncrypto.com](https://www.earncrypto.com/earn-free-monero/?r=65118)

They don't have decred yet sadly, but they add stuff regularly. I have already withdrawn some Reddcoin and Monero, and it has been smooth sailing so far. You can change the coin you're earning anytime. Yes, I get referral commission. But I do believe in their service, and wouldn't be wasting my time if I hadn't seen significant earnings in my account.

What I do is go to Earn Monero (or whatever) at the top left, and then Watch Videos. Load up 3 of the Engage Me videos in separate windows and let them all run at the same time when you're asleep or not using the computer (or 5+ at a time with 2 PCs). I think you can use your phone too but I haven't tried that yet.

For those who want to get into cryptos but don't as much money as they would like to invest, this gives you the opportunity to build a modest yet diverse cryptocurrency portfolio at no expense. You never know which will be the next one to hit $5,000.

Let me know if you have questions and I will do my best to help.

I assume he will use Windows and Paymetheus, which I never used so I'm asking for your help.

My current instructions to him would be:

1. Take this seed
2. Install software
3. Restore wallet from seed

This is simple but lacks one important step: guaranteed transfer of ownership. Even if he trusts me to destroy my copy of the seed I made, I want the transfer to be like cash transfer -- once you give it away you no longer have it.

Adding this step makes things quite complex:

1. Take this seed
2. Install software
3. Create *new* wallet and generate new address X
4. Create *another* wallet by restoring from gift seed
5. Send funds to X

Step 4 may get complicated. Does Paymetheus or Decrediton handle multiple wallets? If no, he will need to learn to run it with different wallet config directories using e.g. command line arguments.

Ideal flow I can imagine is:

1. Take this seed
2. Install software
3. Create *new* wallet
4. *Redeem* this gift seed

Where ""Redeem"" creates a temporary wallet from seed and sends all funds to main wallet.

To sum up, is it correct that first two flows is the only choice right now? If not, please suggest.",NA,"6ztcx3",NA,0,NA,"false",1507332267,"false","self","t5_30fo6","false","serene2","","false","true",NA,"/r/decred/comments/6ztcx3/best_way_to_gift_dcr_to_a_beginner/",NA,"",NA,"Question","",0,0

I've repeatedly bumped into Decred during my crypto life.  It's been recommended as innovative tech by people I respect.  But in the end, I thought that democracy or even stakeholder voting is something we want to avoid unless it's really necessary.  

In democracy we end up electing bad leaders and politics and even in democratic countries, which are supposed to be the best, is the most dystopic aspect of modern society IMO.  All the ugly back-end squabbling is put on display.  The front end is the back end in politics and which essentially means there is no user interface and so politics is just a big mess.   All in all I feel democracy is deeply flawed but the best option we have (at least until a superintelligent AI can save us :p).  

I feel similarly about stakeholder voting.  In companies the shareholders have some voting rights but at the end of the day its the CEO who runs it and they are an expert and leader.

Companies are authoritarian regimes that are very efficient but are profit motivated and so are brutal.  They have to have moral laws enforced on them by a democratic government.  But the point is they are powerful because of their central leadership and organised nature.

Stakeholder voting doesn't allow for the advantages that a central company has.  It is leaderless, it lacks a biz-dev department to connect to the real world, its disorganised and may not have a clear goal and direction.

Does that mean DCR is a recipe for failure?  Well, I thought so, which is why I haven't invested, but having thought about it more it gets even more complicated than that.

Blockchains are innately decentralised, they have to be for the currency to have value.  So central companies having their own blockchains undermines the purpose of them.  So there needs to be a decentralised governance model.

Is the governance of bitcoin and ethereum really that bad that its worth starting all over again?  They have a huge network effect advantage over DCR and central undemocratic governments can persist and even succeed for a long time (e.g. CCP).

Decred's value proposition is all about it being able to upgrade its software as needed by good governance.  It's an extremely basic thing and therefore a very bearish bet on the state of cryptocurrencies.  If you think we need Decred, you must also think that we have to go back to basics.  Are other coins really going to fail due to bad governance?  

I'm left thinking Decred is interesting and might turn out to be important.  But overall I still have confidence the big coins will manage to scale properly and that their governance isn't so incredibly bad that we have to start all over again with Decred.

Thoughts?

From my understanding, stakeholders need to vote to maintain the system, right? Every block mined needs 3/5 votes to be validated. The incentive to stakeholders to lock away their funds and buy tickets is the PoS reward. 

However, as the total supply of coins reaches its cap, the mining/staking reward diminishes/ends. PoW miners have the incentive of transaction fees to keep working even with no block reward, but what is the incentive for the stakeholders? As I see it, buying and voting actually costs a small fee, and without the stake reward there is no reason to buy new tickets.

Can someone point out what I am missing here?

How do we get big enough for governance to be important?","I've set a slightly provocative title on purpose to encourage discussion.

If the Decred devs were working on building a governance system for Bitcoin, it would likely do very well if it were implemented because Bitcoin is currently being held back by governance issues. It would likely materially affect Bitcoin's price positively as it reduces uncertainty. 

However, Decred isn't yet large enough for any decision to have a big bearing - i.e. governance is relatively less important for Decred until it's widely used. So the governance systems we are building, will have a relatively small impact for quite some time, until Decred becomes ""big"" enough. 

So my hypothesis is that Decred will really shine if and when it becomes so large that it needs real governance. 

The questions I put to you are:

1) How big does Decred need to get for sound governance to be of real value (e.g. as it valuable as it would be for Bitcoin today)?

2) How do we get Decred to this point?

3) There is still a risk that Decred's governance model doesn't solve certain problems in the future. How do we road test Decred's governance system on as many different types of problems as quickly as possible to show that it is effective in settling differences between sides with minimal fighting and uncertainty?

I've done some reading, but some of it went over my head. 

So I've already had a couple of tickets voted and what I'm a bit unsure about is the following:

- Who decides on the proposals that the users need to vote on? Can anyone submit a proposal?

- If a proposal goes through, like the current one about requesting the developers to work on lightning, how can anyone ensure that that's actually gonna happen? It's all nice to say yes we'll vote on it, but what's stopping a majority of the developers to say screw it and do their own thing? Would voting not be sort of irrelevant then?

- Is there a way one can ""cancel"" a mature ticket and get the DCR back immediately?

- What will happen when DCR tickets become too expensive? 

I have a couple of other questions, not necessarily about staking:

- How does the dev subsidy get controlled? Who controls those funds? 

- What's to stop a massive whale from buying up the supply left on exchanges and have the biggest voting power? Would we not centralize the decisions for proposals?

I hope to get some answers, or at least some pointers to answers would be great. Thanks!

As a payment gateway dealing with cryptocurrencies only, our team at CoinGate are very happy about their growing popularity. For quite a long time we worked with Bitcoin payments only, but we eventually came to realize that it’s no longer just Bitcoin that is important. 

Contrary to some people, we believe that cryptocurrencies should not just be regarded as tokens or assets, but also should serve a purpose in making everyday payments. As the crypto-payments industry is still tiny compared to conventional payment methods, it is quite difficult, however, to inform people about the possibility to pay with cryptocurrencies, and convince them it is worth the effort.

So, we have come here to this subreddit to let you know that because of our recent integration with ShapeShift we allow our merchants to accept Decred! So you can actually pay with DCR if you ever come across one of the CoinGate merchants!

In addition to Decred, our payment gateway allows customers to pay with a number cryptocurrencies. Our team are certain that the so-called altcoins with their rapidly growing value have huge potential in becoming relevant for casual payments online. As such, we are preparing on the future and are currently working on our invoices to make the payment experience with DCR and other cryptocurrencies smooth and friendly to casual users. 

Actually, if you use cryptos for making payments online, but never thought it’s possible to pay with Decred too, let your favorite merchants know about CoinGate and our payment processing service - we would be super happy if you did!

Kind regards,
CoinGate Team

Also, decred is touted as non forkable. Could someone walk me through the logic here?

As far as unforkable, I see the incentive as less because stakeholders would hold the same amount in the forked version, so the same thing being voted on that caused the fork would not pass in the fork as well (unless of course people sold and balances changed). So I would like to know for sure why they call it unforkable, but my main question is what was meant when I read in the docs that the miners could do something if a large stakeholder was gaming the system.

Sincerely,
Your curious sockpuppet

Edit: *I see the incentive as less because stakeholders would hold the same amount in the forked version, so the same thing being voted on that caused the fork would not pass in the fork as well (unless of course people sold and balances changed).* This would actually not make sense .. because whichever way it could be forked without permission of the vote, that could just continue to happen to infinity. When typing I was thinking the people that could cancel the vote that were in the original chain would be malicious during future upgrades of the forked one.

**Edit2: Question answered by this below:**
*Ok, I think I know what you're talking about now. You're referring to the upgrade process. See https://docs.decred.org/getting-started/user-guides/agenda-voting/ for the voting cycle.* ... *if PoW doesn't play nicely, eventually PoS can start to reject the old version blocks, so PoS always wins (short of PoW abandoning ship per the mutually assured destruction I previously mentioned).*

For example, the current vote agenda would activate features needed for Lightning Network. However, I bet a huge percentage of stakers/voters don't have the expertise or time (or both) to audit the code and make an informed decision.

For obvious reasons, many of us trust the current development team, so this isn't a huge issue right now. However, it may become one in the future. 

What is the solution? Should we consider the ability to delegate our votes to someone we trust? Do we need to have an established ""debate"" system where the developers defend their code against auditors? Should the development subsidy eventually be partitioned to include a portion for independent auditors?

Also, is there a minimum amount of miners running new version software (I know it would take 95% for consensus, but a literal hard number) it would require for the network to be stable in this scenario? For example, like 1000 because like 10 miners for the whole network being all that are not rejected seems like there could be issues, such as not being enough hash power for strength of the cryptographic puzzle that is being solved.

Keep in mind that the code to implement these features, as described in detail by the linked DCPs, is already included in the latest version of the software in a dormant state.  Whether or not it activates depends on the result of the vote.

At a completely high level, as the title of the vote implies, these changes are necessary to fully support the Lightning Network (LN).

The [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/) is the most directly useful application of smart contracts to date since it allows for off-chain transactions that optionally settle on-chain. This infrastructure has clear benefits for both scaling and privacy. Decred is optimally positioned for this integration.

just a wild thought - maybe we could just launch companies on Decred that have their own tokens, and they are developed using the DAO funds. Therefore we don’t have to raise funds via an ICO - the tokens are just issued to the stakeholders, bringing value to them, and then its up to them to decide what they do with it e.g. sell on the market. (edited)


**go1dfish [11:04 AM] **
Telling the thugs to fuck off with their arbitrary mandates?  But yeah valid concern.
The Decred Digest
yep but if eths value is derived from icos, and it can’t legally hold them, then wheres the value in it.
Posted in #tradingToday at 10:50 AM


**bacobob [11:04 AM] **
Yea I doubt the DEV subsidy is big enough for that atm


**ark_adius [11:04 AM] **
joined #trading.


**thedecreddigest [11:04 AM] **
yep i agree


**bacobob [11:05 AM] **
@thedecreddigest  you need new money flowing in not our money floating out


**thedecreddigest [11:05 AM] **
that would come via people buying into decred


**solar [11:05 AM] **
So you're  saying like use dev fund to fund DeSia for example, then airdrop or reward DeSia to stakeholders? (edited)


**thedecreddigest [11:06 AM] **
more people buy decred = increase in price = increase in dev fund value


**solar [11:06 AM] **
There was a great reddit post about this a month or two ago.


**thedecreddigest [11:07 AM] **
but that would only happen if there was real value in the companies launched that the tokens represent a share in i suppose


**solar [11:07 AM] **
Someone mentioned even selecting specific projects for dev funds to go to when you vote, and then your PoS subsidy could include or be replaced with that project's token


**bacobob [11:08 AM] **
Better include to pos indeed that would be cool

So you get your dcr but also other coins stake

Build on the network

That would be really cool actually and will bring a huge value


**thedecreddigest [11:08 AM] **
yeah, build everything on us. no need for cash - we are the cash


**bacobob [11:09 AM] **
People would love to stake then

Actually not that bad but sounds hard to a chief

People can vote on the proposal and on succes the token will be added to the pos rewards

More incentive to hold dcr and stake


**thedecreddigest [11:10 AM] **
you might not even need a token

you could probably just use decred for most things


**solar [11:11 AM] **
I think tokens would be good &amp; probably necessary


**bacobob [11:11 AM] **
@thedecreddigest  people would live tokens


**solar [11:11 AM] **
For representing whatever units needed by the various subsystems


**bacobob [11:11 AM] **
You can own your own amount


**go1dfish [11:11 AM] **
issuing tokens != ICO and they have uses beyond it

yeah what solar is saying


**bacobob [11:11 AM] **
Yep that's what I ment


**go1dfish [11:12 AM] **
issuing tokens just means you want/need your own ledger of some sort of value


**bacobob [11:12 AM] **
Some need way more amount

Regarding decentralized governance, we're taking an incremental path. In order to run a cc, there's tons of stuff that needs to happen.
 
We determined the most contentious of those decisions were consensus changes, and these major decisions would be a good place to start when answering the question ""how should cc governance work?""

Our on-chain voting system allows stakeholders to vote on and ultimately activate or ignore proposed consensus changes.

It's easy to argue that decentralized governance is a bad idea when people are so conditioned to accept a centralized governance system.

Bitcoin is centrally planned, operated by Bitcoin Core, funded mainly by Blockstream, and there is no sign of that changing.

We have already seen several debates break out as to whether or not some consensus change should be made - it has held up development progress for years.

It serves to obviate how important aligning the changes in your project with your users are, which BTC does a pretty awful job at.


**karamble [14:26]**

At least they are expecting more delegated governance. There are also other cc projects in the space with a delegated approach and their users seem to be happy (blindfolded) with that. Decred's voting right is reflected directly in the stake size they hold (...)


**jy-p [14:28]**

My belief is that decentralized governance will lead to a much more productive project, beyond the utility of it being able to make consensus changes in the span of a few months.

If consensus code is the magic engine that runs every cc, then it needs to be refined, built out, debugged, etc. 

Endless [bikeshedding](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/Parkinsons-law-of-triviality-bikeshedding) about block size or segwit is just wasting everyone's time.

Let's make a decision and get the ball rolling. with the infrastructure Decred has, we can undo changes that are deemed 'bad' at some later point.

If a VC wants to participate in Decred, they just buy some coins, stake them and start participating, versus attempting to buy out the core dev team as an end-run.

Decred's decentralization will make it much harder to 'capture' the system over time, which it is important to guard against.",NA,"75ovnz",NA,0,NA,"false",1510422606,"false","self","t5_30fo6","false","serene33","","false","true",NA,"/r/decred/comments/75ovnz/decentralized_governance_discussion_on_slack/",NA,"",NA,"Transcript","",0,0

I am not sure that these thoughts are correct, so I would ask for a discussion with everyone's thoughts.

The first thing that comes to mind is ""Great! I'm getting free money!"" and while, as a disabled vet, I would love some free money for nothing that just doesn’t make sense to me. 

I have been in the space long enough to understand that hash power equals network security. I remember all the fuss when pools would get close to or exceed 50% of the hash rate. But let’s be honest, someone still has more than 50% of the hash rate. And while it has stalled development, it has not stalled the price. My question has become, just how much does hash power matter? Does it really matter in Decred where stakeholders have a vote on every block? 

If it does matter, and I think there are probably cases for and against, then forking to create new coins from any coin doesn’t make a lot of sense for the original coin due to lost hash power. As I think I’ve heard before hash power follows the money. Therefore, to a certain extent, so should network security. The most important security of a cryptocurrency lies in actual code much more than the hash power. The security of the hash power only prevents a takeover of the network. Now here is where I think Decred has a huge advantage in that the stakeholders control the network, not miners. The miners are here to earn a living NOT to control Decred or its users. Our job as stakeholders is to pay the miners a fair wage for their services.

I think of Decred as a cypherpunk corporation. It only makes sense that I would see the staking rewards as anything that remotely resembles a crypto dividend. It also brings to with these ICOs that where are their returns? I think of ICOs as a money suck because most have less than adequate developers with experience in cryptocurrency programming and I haven’t seen any way to return profits to initial investors other than in a marketing gamble. Truth be told, I quit even looking at them, until one can produce working code and a way to provide returns other than gambling with my money.

The second issue I have with the term “crypto dividends” when used to described newly forked coins, is that it still concentrates wealth even more. People who understand crypto will sell for more Bitcoin. The bottom line is, in my opinion, that it is bad for any cryptocurrency to be able to fork and create a new coin. That is one of the many qualities that initially attracted me to Decred.

Well this could be better, but I would love to hear what others think. What do you think is a “crypto dividend”?

As an option to avoid keyloggers if possible it should have random on screen blanked out key boards that rely on human memory for character mapping. 

That way you can use the mailservice on public computers. And if your memory fails you to some extent the recipient will still be able to figure out what you meant to write. We're already faced with similar decryption tasks when reading autocorrected/suggested words in messaging apps.

A free and open for all email service is potentially a viral vector, ie a way to reach millions of people with the benefits of DCR.

Just some input, I watched the new Youtube video ""What is Decred? An Introduction"" by the official Decred and it doesn't mention Decentralized Credits anywhere.

""why is the name Decred? decentralized credit?"" Digital e-credibility""?

If you want to cast your *own* votes, you must meticulously monitor your votecasting rig's uptime and connectivity. IOW, casting votes in the Decred system is operationally challenging, inherently so.

Importantly, if you're not running your own votecasting rig(s), which is to be *fully expected*, you have very limited control over how your votes are recorded on-chain. This has wide-reaching implications on the Decred system's on-chain scalability.

Again, although stakepool owners may be ethically obligated to follow through on your voting preferences, stakepool owners aren't *cryptographically* obligated to cast votes per your voting preferences. Remember, these votes extend the Decred mainnet blockchain. Eventually these votes could even disburse DCR funds from what is essentially a decentralized piñata to whomever, whenever.

This is arguably an order of magnitude *worse* than the scalability situation in Bitcoin.

Now, you might think solo staking offers a solution to this problem. Perhaps you could initialize a wallet on a trusted offline machine, lock down wallet.db with a secure password then upload the locked wallet to an untrusted machine. At that point, you'd think it wouldn't really matter what mainnet block sizes are. Unfortunately, the Decred wallet has to be unlocked to cast your  vote, meaning your voting preferences can't be locked down so easily.

Or, you might think we should add a cryptographic attestation requirement to casting non-abstain votes. Perhaps Decred users could sign a document attesting to their voting preferences. Without this signed document, the stakepool would always vote ""abstain"" on behalf of the user. But an attacker could simply delete these signed documents on a compromised machine, changing your ""yay"" or ""nay"" vote to abstain, leading to utter pandemonium.

After much consideration, my conclusion is Decred tickets must be adequately distributed across a combination of decentralized stakepools and solo staker-owned votecasting rigs. Huge block sizes will impose extreme operational costs on top of the *already-costly* act of running a stakepool or solo staking setup, creating a situation where votecasting is highly vulnerable to outside manipulation with horrific results.

In this sense, Decred is even less scalable on-chain than Bitcoin-like systems which lack a stakemining component.",NA,"789iw5",NA,0,NA,"false",1510470309,"false","self","t5_30fo6","false","serene3","","false","true",NA,"/r/decred/comments/789iw5/why_decred_doesnt_scale_onchain/",NA,"",NA,"Discussion","",0,1

- is any **mobile wallet app** being developed or in the dev roadmap plans? I personally think this would be a big step and maybe you could hire some android and ios developers to do this. (at first, it could be just a simple mobile wallet, to store, receive and send DCR). A mobile wallet should come BEFORE thinking about **payment plugins for sellers** (my opinion).

- will the **public proposal system** also need to be voted at voting.decred.org? Regardless, is there any prediction for this?

- about **enhanced privacy** features: it will use LN resources (eg, a unique channel for performing anonymous transactions)? And it (privacy) will be optional or for all transactions (like xmr)?

- **ledger wallet integration** : I know it has nothing to do with dev, but do you have any information about the progress of this integration? it will really be delivered October 16th?

**ps:** in the description, I think it is important to emphasize that our reddit is not very active because it is relative new and our community is still spread among other social media tools, such as slack (5000+ members).

**ps2**: I don't know what is the status of the dev subsidy funds, but please, try to allocate part of that money to cover costs of listing DCR on other exchanges. **This is very important. Even if they ask, for example, US $ 100,000, this is nothing compared to the short-term impact on the marketcap (1% increase in the price means an increase in the marketcap by almost 2 million dollars)** and the long-term effect of adding new members to the community. Consider paying the price to be listed on BINANCE.com as well...

**ps3**: if we get listed on HitBTC, we may have a DCR/USDT pair. Amazing, right?",NA,"74lhoj",NA,0,NA,"false",1510402218,"false","self","t5_30fo6","false","serene2","","false","true",NA,"/r/decred/comments/74lhoj/could_some_decred_staff_member_with_decredorg/",NA,"",NA,"Question","",0,0

Assumptions and Simplifications:

* Each year is 365 days with no regard for leap years
* There are an average of 144 Bitcoin blocks per day (target of 10 minutes per block)
* There are an average of 288 Decred blocks per day (target of 5 minutes per block)
* The Decred values are the max possible even though the real values will be slightly lower because missed votes reduce subsidy and stakeholders can strip a block's Proof-of-Work subsidy for misbehaving miners, which naturally in turn reduces the total possible supply
* The total final supply for both is 21 million coins",NA,"78hzyl",NA,0,NA,"false",1510474597,"false","self","t5_30fo6","false","serene8","dev","false","true",NA,"/r/decred/comments/78hzyl/yearly_comparison_of_decred_and_bitcoin_estimated/",NA,"Lead c0 DCR Dev",NA,"Educational","",0,0

It [looks](https://dcrstats.com/) like we're at 31% DCR mined. I'm not sure when we're expected to start reaching the max, but I understand that means the mining subsidy has basically run out. That's the coinbase reward that miners make for creating a new block.

Does that mean the only mining incentive then would be PoS ticket fees and transaction fees? Those go up with demand, so in order to keep miners incentivized, it's really a game of getting more adoption by the time the mining subsidy runs out.

For example, what if if every one out of every 1000 bitcoin (or ethereum, or litecoin) users received a DCR airdrop worth $10?

One of two things would then happen for every lucky recipient: either they would be too lazy to actually start using Decred, which would render the $10 in DCR burned (for a while, at least), OR they would start using Decred, significantly expanding the network.

I am concerned that a digital currency with absolute privacy will not be able to be widely adopted due to regulations aimed at combating financial crimes, limiting funding of terrorism, etc. As an example of this, Coinbase recently published the factors they evaluate when considering which assets to support on GDAX (https://www.gdax.com/static/digital-asset-framework-2017-11.pdf), and list compliance obligations including the Anti-Money-Laundering program. 

Similarly, there are ethics reasons which are harder to see in a vacuum, but may become clear at a later point in time. For example, imagine what would happen if it became clear that Monero transfers were used to fund a large terrorist attack. 

I am sure there is a way to strike a good balance between privacy and compliance with reasonable regulations, and would like to hear thoughts from everyone about where that balance may lie for Decred.

Conducting this research and publishing the results could be the best opportunity Decred has seen in a long time for publicizing the advantages of its approach to consensus. This is the case because:

1. No other cryptocurrency has implemented a Decred-like PoW/PoS consensus system yet (with the notable exception of Hcash, a *direct* clone coin), and
2. The Bitcoin Core vs Bitcoin Cash rivalry is seemingly worsening, leading to truly wild swings in Bitcoin's hash rate and market price

It seems like this is one of the biggest open research opportunities available in cryptocurrency today. Frankly, screw the scalability debates: the knowledge of how to contain a hostile spinoff coin before it becomes a danger to the community's cohesiveness is much more important and far more timely given current events.

In reality, you could duplicate the Core/Cash dynamic in Decred by producing a spinoff of Decred's ledger which uses an identical hashing algorithm. Step two: invent a reason for a debate. While many have theorized Decred can handle this scenario, nobody knows for sure what would happen next in the Decred system:

- Would stakeminers be able to reject blocks produced by the defecting PoW miners?
- If so, does this effectively contain the spinoff coin? On what timeframe?
- Is there anything the developers of the spinoff coin can do to sabotage the containment efforts?

Conducting this important experiment and publishing the results could be hugely effective at driving the greater cryptocurrency conversation forward, based on hard scientific data. And it goes without saying it could change the game for public awareness of Decred.",NA,"7cipyu",NA,0,NA,"false",1512248388,"false","self","t5_30fo6","false","serene3","","false","true",NA,"/r/decred/comments/7cipyu/research_topic_containing_a_hostile_coinsplit/",NA,"",NA,"Discussion","",0,1

This kind of competition is becoming more common, these are interesting and I think the approach will be successful in cultivating new developments. As someone who's interested in the technology, I would like to know more about the projects that are being developed for these competitions. Where there are prizes involved, there may also be an opportunity to generate some interest in the competitive aspect. 

I'm not aware of any of the entries that are being developed for the Politeia competition, maybe that information is floating around and passed me by, but my impression is that entries are being developed behind closed doors. I think it would be cool if I could see a set of project descriptions that tell me roughly what people are working on. I don't know if github repos would also make sense.

The competition announcement doesn't explain how winners will be selected. Could the judging incorporate an element of ticket voting through the Politeia system? Maybe one of the prizes could be awarded based on ticket voting? ""Stakey's choice"" award. It would be nice as part of the launch of the proposal system, to show it in action in the light of making a decision that's interesting and not overly technical, something that people who don't necessarily understand the technology (there are literally dozens of us) can engage with. 

One of the factors determining Pi's success will be the calibre and volume of community activity. The dev fund will be used for a variety of purposes, the more people with domain knowledge and expertise in the community looking at proposals in areas they're familiar with, the more effectively funds will be spent. Any buzz that can be cultivated around the competition is good for Decred in general, and I would argue that it is particularly a good idea to try and grow the community of engaged stakeholders in the run-up to the launch of the proposal system.

I appreciate that people might be reluctant to make their idea or early code public, but it would fit the Decred philosophy to be pushing the boundaries of openness and community participation/oversight. The prizes are coming from the Decred dev fund, one of the returns on this investment of DAO funds is in attention garnered by the competition itself - the competition can be better leveraged to this end.

For the Decred DAO to be successful it needs to develop good social norms and processes to make best use of the tools available to it, and the competition is an opportunity to kick that off on the right foot.

To boil this down in tl;dr fashion, I'm making two suggestions for discussion, they would work well together but not an absolute necessity to do both:
1. Use Decred's forthcoming proposal voting system to do (some of) the judging for the Politeia contest. Seems like a nice decision to get the ball rolling with, and could potentially generate more interest and buzz to have this decision being made by Decred stakeholders through the proposal system.
2. Encourage entrants to the contest to submit descriptions of what they're working on or planning to submit. Without this there's no way to know if the prospective entrants are strong or weak, this would be a useful signal for people who are on the fence about getting involved.

I'm new to DCR, and very excited about the platform.   I've successfully staked on the Decrediton app and have some tickets purchased, so all is well with that.

How do you keep track of your transaction data for tax purposes?  Between ticket fees and mining rewards in the pool, I will need to parse out the data into a spreadsheet.  On Decrediton, the transaction data is displayed in the history section, but it's not spreadsheet friendly.  Is there an easy way to obtain all of this data?   Once there are a lot of transactions in a single year, copying this data from decrediton could be really cumbersome.

I've also received a subsidy for a successfully voted ticket, but I don't know when the transaction took place.  I would need a timestamp for the receipt of that subsidy for tax purposes.  Where is that data?

I'd also love to not have to check into Decrediton every day to check on the status of my tickets.  Is there any way to receive a notification if one of my live tickets has voted?

Thank you all and excited to be apart of the community!

One of the main reasons for ASICs is that if you don't have them, and someone develops it, that someone gets control of the coin. So the natural response is to develop ASICs preemptively in a decentralised way, right?

Well what about the option to change algorithm to an ASIC resistant one? 

A mining algorithm change is a ""power move"" and it's mere possibility will force ASIC miners to HODL for votes, and therefore positive for price development to bring to light. 

However, with an ever slower coin creation rate we have already weathered the main flow of coins from ""dump miners"", at least from coin creations (not fees). 

I'm also curious about the cost and risks of a pure software development investement in form of an algorithm change vs ASIC investments to tackle a potential hostile ASIC attack. 

What about multiple algorithms with regards to Decred? Some for ASICs some for CPU or GPU? Why just one ASIC algorithm in the case of Decred?

Could you give me some advice on how to improve? 

Apologies in advance for the noob questions, I assure you I've been reading up on mining in general for quite a while and have tried more than one miner, but apparently im not as tech-savvy as I thought. 

Today was the first day I successfully started mining. I followed this YT tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coLKtPrL54w) which involves CC miner (version: x64-2.2.2. -cuda9.7z (since I have Nvidia driver 388.13)) to mine DCR. 

But my hashrate is around 379 H/s, which seems really low? I saw another user on here with a GTX 960m which was already mining with MH/s.

So can anyone help me figure out what it is I am doing wrong?

I use the following line in the .bat file in CC miner map:
ccminer-64 -o stratum+tcp://yiimp.eu:3252 -u my address -p c=DCR

The guy with the 960m also had these nice visuals to show (https://i.redd.it/8whwqtcj9lzz.jpg), is that due to his particular wallet, or should each miner automatically be able to access some kind of overview like it?

Did I miss some crucial step? 

Any help would be really appreciated.

ASICs will probably be bought by already existing HODLers. HODLers tend to keep HODLing.
Non HODLers getting ASICs will be incentivised to start HODLing for tickets so that they get voting say for example on the question of changing mining algo which could otherwise crash their ASIC investment. 
Basically there is a chance of price shooting up ever higher once Decred specific ASICs hit the network. 

And if this is anticipated by a price rise leading up to that...the ASIC miners will need to sell even fewer DCRs to cover electricity, ie keeping price even higher.

If price is set like the level of water in a bath tub is set by a source and a sink in equilbrium and the sink flow (ie the sells) is reduced to half...the water level doesn't just double it gains a neverending upward rise...

Im sure there are better analogies but they tend to emanate in  some sort of price overflow or explosion ;)

I would argue it has relevance even after. Would you still drink CocaCola if they namechanged to CocaShit? A good product can fix a bad name but would they really gain anything worth it by having more difficulty to gain traction?

Currency units trading at accumulation levels is of course both  positive and a negative.

People are asking how can the price of Decred be so low and no one has a good answer.  Could the name be part of it?

An undeniable example is how a name starting with Bi, Bit, Et or Eth will get a lot of extra exposure. So at least with regards to exposure name matters!

In 1972 Standard Oil of New Jersey needed to change name. They spent [100 million USD](http://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/09/business/the-singular-power-of-a-giant-called-exxon.html?pagewanted=all) on it. 

The conclusions are if you don't change name you've gained up to a 100 million dollars already but also that some successful businesses find name choice very important. 

With the Dao and Politeia launch I see an opportunity for a brand improvement just making the core messages of our currency and it's progress more clear and effective. A symbol of progress. Of course we should probably not spend a 100 million USD on it. And if it doesn't work out i guess we could change back. 

I'm not a marketing expert but these thoughts have sprung to my mind. Could it be Politeia Dollars, BitDAO, an evolved logo? What do you think? Could there be some opportunities here?

In order to try and explain why this is the case, the following is an analysis that first describes the important aspects of the system as they relate to this topic and then walks through the process of what would happen in a fork attempt under the worst case scenario.

# Preliminaries

The Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system works by locking up chunks of coins into what is called a *ticket*.  These tickets function as the fundamental building block which allows stakeholders to participate in governance.  Once acquired, all tickets are placed into a pool of live tickets after a maturity period.  This pool is known as the live ticket pool and has a target size of 40960, but it can grow larger or shrink as tickets are added and removed throughout the course of operation, and the ticket price (stake difficulty) is adjusted, per supply and demand, to try to maintain that target pool size.  This is covered more in depth in [DCP0001](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0001/dcp-0001.mediawiki) for readers who want a more thorough treatment.

The consensus rules enforce a ticket selection algorithm that works to ensure that ticket selection is both random and impossible for miners to manipulate.  It achieves this by deterministically and pseudorandomly selecting 5 tickets from the aforementioned live ticket pool which are eligible to vote on the previous block and that at least 3 of them must be included.  The subsidy is reduced if only 3 or 4 votes are included, by 20% and 40%, respectively, in order to discourage miners from ignoring votes and otherwise attempting to game the system.  A detailed treatment of the theory behind each of these parameters is beyond the scope of this post, however, it primarily has to do with protection against various adversarial situations.

Further, the deterministic pseudorandom ticket selection process is primarily based on seeding it with the hash of the block it's voting on.  This implies that, if you're building, say block 100000, on top of block 99999 (hash 00000000000000dab92a8a0c0e706eb74115f0f373669c01ffb4882f9555f494), the chosen tickets are known to every other full node on the network and can't be changed without going back to find a new solution to block 99999 such that it has a different hash (say 00000000000004289d9a7b0f7a332fb60a1c221faae89a107ce3abbd186c386c), which in turn will cause a new set of 5 tickets to be selected for voting eligibility.

It is also important to note that stakeholders must be present on a given chain fork at the time of block creation in order to cast their vote when their associated ticket is selected.  The act of acquiring a ticket does not mean it automatically votes.  This distinction is key because it means that the ticket pool on a minority fork is largely comprised of non-voting tickets which is why the minority chain is unable to continue.

# Step-by-step Walkthrough

## Scenario, Assumptions, and Methodology

With all of that in mind, let's walk through an attempt to create a minority fork that the majority stakeholders don't agree with.  Let's also assume that both sides of the attempted fork have equal hash power (so 50% hash power on each fork).  Given that a successful vote requires 75% stakeholder approval, in the worst case, 75% of the stakeholders are on the majority chain, while 25% are on the minority chain.  Further, let's assume the most recent block at the point of the fork is block 99999.  Thus both side of the fork are working on trying to find block 100000, one side on the minority rule set, the other side on the majority rule set.  Finally, in order to simplify the description and make it easier to follow the logic, since only 25% of the stakeholders are on the minority chain, let's say that every 4th ticket in the live ticket pool is a stakeholder on the minority chain and the rest are on the majority chain.  In other words, ticket numbers 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, ..., 40956 are tickets in the live pool which represent stakeholders on the minority chain, while ticket numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, ..., 40957, 40958, 40959, are tickets in the live pool which represent stakeholders on the majority chain.

### Block 100000

The following is the sequence of events that will happen:

* The hash power on both chains will try to build a new block on top of block 99999.
*  Per the above description, in order for this new block to be built on the minority chain, it needs to acquire at least 3 votes from the live ticket pool and the selected votes depend on block 99999.
*  The tickets required to build block 100000, which is based on 99999 are ticket numbers 17113, 17331, 21307, 21328, and 24903.
*  As we can see, 4 out of those 5 tickets are stakeholders on the majority chain (ticket numbers 17113, 17331, 21307, and 24903), which means they are going to provide their votes for block 100000 on the majority chain.
*  The minority chain is only able to acquire 1 vote (ticket number 21328), so it can't build a block 100000, instead, it must go back and find a new solution to block 99999 in order to cause a new set of tickets to be selected.

At this point, the chains now look as follows.  The parentheses with the * in this notation indicate blocks that are being worked on.

    ... -&gt; 99999 -&gt; (100000*)   &lt;--- majority stakeholders (75%) are on this chain
       \-&gt; (99999a*)            &lt;--- minority stakeholders (25%) are still on this chain

In other words, the majority chain is now working on block 100000, while the minority chain is stuck trying to find a new solution for block 99999 in order to get a new set of tickets hoping this time they'll be able to get at least 3 votes.  Since, per our thought experiment, both chains have equal hash power, we can safely assume that, on average, both block 100000 on the majority chain a new block 99999 (call it 99999a) on the minority chain will be found around the same time.

### Block 100001

At this point, the following will happen:

*  The hash power on the majority chain will try to build a new block on top of the majority chain's block 100000.  The votes required for this block are ticket numbers 563, 6766, 21009, 37394, and 37775.
*  This time around all 5 out of those 5 tickets happen to be stakeholders on the majority chain, which means they are going to provide their votes for block 100000 on the majority chain which allows block 100001 to be built.
*  The minority chain, now with a new version of block 99999 (99999a) has a new hash, so it ends up requiring ticket numbers 1069, 8007, 16413, 19172, and 31821.
*  The minority chain is still only able to acquire 1 vote (ticket number 19172), so it must once again go back and find yet another new solution to block 99999 in order to cause a new set of tickets to be selected.

At this point, the chains now look as follows:

    ... -&gt; 99999 -&gt; 100000 -&gt; (100001*)  &lt;--- majority stakeholders (75%) are on this chain
       \-&gt; (99999b*)                     &lt;--- minority stakeholders (25%) are still on this chain

In other words, the majority chain is now working on block 100001, while the minority chain is still stuck trying to find yet another new solution for block 99999 in order to get a new set of tickets hoping this time they'll be able to get at least 3 votes.  Since, per our thought experiment, both chains have equal hash power, we can again safely assume that, on average, both block 100001 on the majority chain and a new block 99999 (call it 99999b) on the minority chain will be found around the same time.

### Block 100002

At this point, the following will happen:

*  The hash power on the majority chain will try to build a new block on top of the majority chain's block 100001.  The votes required for this block are ticket numbers 174, 1999, 12808, 31928, and 38317.
*  This time, 3 out of those 5 tickets are stakeholders on the majority chain (ticket numbers 174, 1999, 38317), which means they are going to provide their votes for block 100001 on the majority chain which allows block 100002 to be built.
*  The minority chain, now with a new version of block 99999 (99999b) has a new hash, so it ends up requiring ticket numbers 4653, 15211, 29988, 35175, and 35665.
*  The minority chain is still only able to acquire 1 vote (ticket number 29988), so it must once again go back and find yet another new solution to block 99999 in order to cause a new set of votes to be selected.

At this point, the chains now look as follows:

    ... -&gt; 99999 -&gt; 100000 -&gt; 100001 -&gt; (100002*)  &lt;--- majority stakeholders (75%) are on this chain
       \-&gt; (99999c*)                               &lt;--- minority stakeholders (25%) are still on this chain

In other words, the majority chain is now working on block 100002, while the minority chain is still stuck trying to find yet another new solution for block 99999 in order to get a new set of tickets hoping this time they'll be able to get at least 3 votes.

### Fast-forward to Block 100010

The process repeats until, eventually, some variant of block 99999 on the minority chain gets lucky and happens to select 3 tickets that are on the minority chain.  This turns out to be roughly 1 in 10 tries.  So, fast forwarding a bit to see the chain by the time this happens, the chains would look as follows:

    ... -&gt; 99999  -&gt; 100000 -&gt; 100001 -&gt; 100002 -&gt; ... -&gt; 100009 -&gt; (100010*)  &lt;--- majority stakeholders (75%) are on this chain
       \-&gt; 99999j -&gt; (100000a*)                                                &lt;--- minority stakeholders (25%) are still on this chain

It should be pretty clear, since both chains have equal hash power, there is no way the minority chain can now ever catch up to the majority chain.  Furthermore, the same process is going to repeat for the minority chain's block 100001 where it will have to go back and remine (find new solutions) for its block 100000 over and over until it gets a lucky draw again such that it gets the 3 votes it needs.  Consequently, miners are not going to stay on the minority chain because they're never going to be able to become the majority chain and hence would be mining for free.

# Common objections

## What if the minority chain gets more than 10x the hash power of the main chain?

Theoretically, if the minority chain with only 25% stakeholder approval had 10x the hash power of the main chain, yes, it could keep up with the majority chain, however, this is not a realistic scenario because of the economic incentives.  Mining the minority chain with 10x the hash power effectively means the miners would only be getting 1/10 of the subsidy as they would on the majority chain based on hash power alone, but it's reduced even further by being 1/10 of 60% of the subsidy due to only being able to acquire 3 votes on average.  In other words, miners would only receive 6% of the rewards they would by mining the majority chain, or looking it from the other way, they would receive 94% less by mining the minority chain.

Putting that into numbers, if a miner had, say 5% of the total network hash power, they could expect to receive roughly 5% of the PoW subsidy per block, or 5% of ~13.89 ~= 0.6945 DCR at the current time.  However, on the minority chain, first the subsidy would be 60% of ~13.89 ~= 8.334 DCR, and then that 5% hash power would only be 0.5% of the total hash power on the minority chain, thus 0.5% of ~8.334 ~= 0.04167 DCR.  Thus, we can see that 0.04167 DCR is indeed 6% of 0.6945 DCR.

PoW mining is _very_ competitive since it is a zero sum game.  Most miners, especially those without huge advantages such as free electricity, have very thin margins and are often banking on future appreciation to pick up the slack.  Miners would actually have to **pay** money to mine the minority chain due to the aforementioned effective 94% reduction in income.

## Can't somebody just change the consensus rules to ignore the stakeholders?

Yes, it is theoretically possible to do this, but doing so would completely destroy the hybrid system and return the forked currency to effectively being a pure Proof-of-Work system thereby removing any value of the system.  It would also undoubtedly no longer be Decred, since, unlike in a pure PoW coin where nobody can really say which chain is the ""real"" one and which isn't due to lack of a provable and formalized governance system, Decred has a very clear and well understood governance model where the majority of stakeholders make the decision which chain is the real Decred and they do so in an on-chain and cryptographically provable fashion.

Further, stakeholders sign up for Decred with the expectation that major consensus decisions are made by the stakeholders themselves.  Removing the authority of the stakeholders would be akin to removing Proof-of-Work from a pure PoW coin.  In other words, it would completely destroy the security properties of the system.  How much confidence are holders going to have in a coin that ignores one of the primary characteristics it claims to offer?

I would rather see the resources invested into governance (which appears to be the direction that the community has taken).  Sort of a ""let's do one thing better than everyone else"" instead of trying to hit on every buzzworthy feature.

Secondly, I just don't ever see a coin like Monero (which I love) making it onto a site like Coinbase and LN already provides a layer of anonymity by only reporting the net transacted between two counterparties to the blockchain.  

I'd love to hear/discuss some unique privacy ideas though.",NA,"7ewkez",NA,0,NA,"false",1512295200,"false","self","t5_30fo6","false","serene3","","false","true",NA,"/r/decred/comments/7ewkez/what_type_of_privacy_features_would_people_like/",NA,"",NA,"Discussion","",0,0

So i recently rented 1th/s in nicehash and pointed it to decredpool .org.

Now 2 things that made me think, and since i rented the 1th/s just for testing purposes..

One is that at nearly 1th/s - 900 Gh/s so far i'm only mining 10 coins a day according to the pool info.

The other is that i haven't seen any confirmed or unconfirmed balance.

Am i missing something? i can post some pics if needs be but im finding it odd that nicehash is delivering the speed, the pool is registering everything but im only getting 10 coins a day...

I've been interested in mining for a while now and decided to take the leap with the obelisk dcr1. I understand how risky presales can be but I am also a bit of a gambler.

That being said im trying to prepare as much as possible. Does anybody have any advice for a (hopefully soon to be) new ASIC owner, such as Pitfalls to watch out for? 

Ive seen power supplies mentioned before and am curious if i could outfit the miner with a more powerful supply (im assuming i would need to wait for more concrete specs to know how to proceed here) 

Is there some sort of mobile app i will be able to use to track my performance? 

And finally, are there any resources you can suggest for learning about ASIC set-up/maintenance.

We are pleased to have with us the [dcrASIC team](https://dcrasic.org/) answering questions from the Decreddit community.

*Please post your questions below and the dcrASIC team will answer tomorrow (Nov 14th).*


The team says they garnered experience as  Monero miners in 2015, and in 2016 they added a Zcash GPU farm to their portfolio. They are, in their own words:

&gt;... always developers, not facilities managers [...] bringing mining experience together with engineering skills to build a custom ASIC miner for Decred.


The dcrASIC team is comprised of ( [from their site](https://dcrasic.org/#team) ) :

---

- **Tim Olson**, who will be answering your questions tomorrow, his Reddit username is /u/altasic . Tim is a programmer and entrepreneur with multiple exits and bootstrapped businesses over a 25-year career. He's been working in blockchain since 2013 and has deep technical knowledge from the protocol level on up.

- **Salt**  has been mining Bitcoin in 2011 after working as a Security Analyst. He has managed large mining installations and written custom code for pools and wallets. His experience in mining, pool operation, and blockchain security are essential to the team.

And last but not least:

- **7400**  graduated from MIT then built an impressive 30-year career designing ASIC's for mainframes, PC's, graphics, digital video, and consumer electronics, with 100's of millions of chips produced using his designs. He has been working in blockchain since 2013 and is a perfect fit for building the Materia1 Decred ASIC miner.

They were also featured in a [Decred Assembly Episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K2sDhyjQys) video conversation. 

Ask away!

This got me thinking. If I'm not spending my crypto because I expect it to go up in value, and you're not spending your crypto for the same reason, then doesn't this put a crunch on the available liquid supply? Dampening available supply means exchange rates go up, which in turn confirms the belief that the value of the currency will go up, causing more people to want to hold onto it rather than spend or sell it.

2. Lightning Network failing -- would basically be the death of BTC because they've put all their marbles in one basket.

3. Potential/probable USDT and Bitconnect ponzi schemes.

4. Uncertainty around what might happen when futures start trading

Shouldn't all Cryptocurrencies aim to have privacy as standard?

Hey guys,

I have been thinking about CC's with Privacy as their UVP, since Decred is working on implementing Privacy soon.

Paper money allows for anonymous transactions, to remain anonymous you may be restricted by the distance between yourself and the person your transacting with and your dependent on avoiding the banking system, but on the whole paper money transactions are anonymous.

In the article linked below, Daniel Korski, at the time head of Downing Street Policy Unit, had plans to “set a hard target – no cash in our society by 2020” as part of Conservative Party Policy for the Conservative Party Conference 2015.

https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/29/change-we-need-david-cameron-vetoed-plan-to-scrap-1p-piece

When the day finally arrives, when the G8 countries move towards a full cashless society, the people may turn to CC as an alternative, which brings me to my question, shouldn't all Cryptocurrencies aim to have privacy as standard?

FYI this is also been posted in the Monero subreddit, I'm curious to know their opinion on it because if their general opinion is ""yes, all crypto currencies should be private by default"" then what becomes of CC's like Monero where Privacy is there UVP/ No1 Feature, or in some case, their only feature, i.e. Shouldn't you offer more than Privacy?",NA,"7jr4og",NA,0,NA,"false",1515329557,"false","self","t5_30fo6","false","serene3","","false","true",NA,"/r/decred/comments/7jr4og/shouldnt_all_cryptocurrencies_have_privacy_by/",NA,"",NA,"Discussion","",0,1

Decred has a solution for long term issues with hybrid PoW/PoS, 10% block reward to development funds, and voting. Out of all the coins I've looked at so far, this system makes the most sense in terms of longevity and reliable development for the lifetime of the coin.

&amp;nbsp;
 
However, in my opinion, the main problem with decred is marketing. After watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qEvMlI8enA) video from decred's channel a few days ago, there's a segment where Luke says Hshare is just a copy+paste of decred but somehow has a higher market cap and no real development team. From what I can tell, the only difference is the fact that Hshare is on more exchanges. Decred has 99% of its volume from just two exchanges, Bittrex and Poloniex. 

&amp;nbsp;

Most people don't even know why they're investing in a cryptocurrency other than the fact that it's on the exchange they're using. Does decred plan to focus efforts on getting on as many exchanges as possible or is that not a concern for the developers?

I am a 100% disabled vet, retired after 20 years of service. So here is a quick rundown.....
1999--diagnosed with testicular cancer / testicle removed / radiation. Dealt with it all by myself, my wife at the time was out smoking crack at the time of surgery. No family or friends came to visit me during my radiation.

~2001 My Dad passed away at the age of 48. My wife at the time took my  truck during his funeral and disappeared to smoke crack. That was divorce #2 during same time. Cost me a bankruptcy.... For the record, dont get married because your lonely, leads to bad choices....

2003- Married wife #3. She was a single mom of three children. Although Doc told me I would never have children, my son was born while I was deployed to Iraq. I didnt see him for three months.... When I did, I knew the meaning of ""True Love"". 

2003-2014 did a few more tours to Afghanistan, Qatar, and one to South Korea. Marriage was horrible, very mentally abusive wife (yes, it does happen to men) so I left the marriage after I retired. Don't get married because you want a family.... It was absolutely the worste divorce ever as my ex tried everything in the world to keep my son from me, and still does to this day.

2015- Lived with a girlfriend for a while, but had to move out of there Christmas day. Fucking homeless.... the only money I had coming in was the small retirement. Just enough to pay a car payment and cell bill to keep talking with my son. Thank goodness my family stepped in and gave me a place to stay while I waited for my disablity determination. Finally recieved my first disabilty lump sum which was enough to get me from Alabama back to Washington and buy a small 27"" Catalina sailboat to live in, at least I was able to be back in my boy's life. Then at the end of the summer of 2015 he told me he wanted to live with me. I started looking for bigger boats frantically. Nothing. Then two days later I received the rest of my lump sum, and found this 42' boat on the same day. Bought it sight unseen..... Oh by the way, did I mention I hate living on the water? I was supposed to be buying land and farming for retirement.....

Anyway, in 2016 i started buying Bitcoin again because I realized the need to store money for my sons future. When my Dad passed, I got nothing but a pistol. I fucking hate guns.... So it is very important to me as a Dad, that when i pass I leave land and home for my son. So from Sept 2016 - Feb 2017 I started buying as much bitcoin as I could. Mind you Im retired and disabled so it wasnt much at all. But in Feb, I found out about Decred and have been all in ever since. Thank goodness I made that decision because in Feb the reason I stopped investing money was simple- somehow there wasnt any money left to stick away because of bills. My son still hasnt come to live with me. But, because I had enough Decred to stake a few tickets, I have been able to pay my bills and have enough to take my son to do things when we are together. 

I write all of this not for thanks my service, I regret ever choosing that path, nor for any of that sympathy shit.... I write it so that you know that Faith is one of the most important things in the world. My Faith lies in the fact I have made good decisions for my son's future. I see the benefits of that Faith every month when I cash out all of my staking rewards and buy groceries and take my son out to do stuff. So from the deepest depths of my heart, thank you to the Decred Project for playing such a huge part in my life and providing a bright future for my son.

This was a severe bug that would have allowed users to print coins out of thin air via quadruple-spending. Fortunately, it was never exploited.

Since revealing the vulnerability would have enabled its exploitation, the Monero team had to undergo a covert process to fix the bug then get everyone to upgrade without informing stakeholders as to the true purpose of the patch.

As the intention in Decred is for the community to vote on changes, how would the dev team go about responding to such a situation? Would they stealthily slip the fix into another patch, as with Monero? This raises some interesting questions around governance and highlights that no system, even one of on-chain governance, is totally trustless. It would obviously be infeasible for the community to approve every pull request for example, so clearly there is a middle ground to be found here.

--Huge amounts of money are flowing into projects with no real world use case and no real world market demand. (There is a coin called Dentacoin which is a ""coin for dentists"" that has a 20+ million dollar valuation)

--Copy/paste projects are getting hundred million dollar valuations (Hshare, Bitcoin Gold)

--There are at least two known scams in BitConnect and Tether (and probably 5x this amount of unknown scams)

One central tenant of chaos theory is that exponential growth can never be sustained.  People are getting in to get rich and cheer for the moon rather than actually wanting to use crypto in their every day life and start a revolution. Cryptocurrency was designed as e-cash, not a ""store of value."" Something that can be hacked, phished, and has 100% annualized volatility is NOT a long term store of value.

This could continue and go much higher for all of 2018 but eventually there's going to be a nasty crash. The good news is, crypto, like the tech sector, will have a few projects rise out of the ashes and continue to see incredible growth.

I expect the entire space to correct sharply with many coins never recovering --  What coins/qualities do people think will make for the next Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google of the crypto world?

Off the top of my head:

1. Governance -- It's why we're all here.  If you're in crypto for the long haul it's because you want control over your own money (not the Fed, Core, or Roger/Jihan pulling the levers for you).

2. Speed/Costs -- Coins need to actually be useful as e-cash and be able to scale/get used in transactions. Lightning Network is a really cool technology but I'm not sure it's the be all/end all panacea people claim it is.  Putting all your eggs into L/N as a solution is highly risky.  If we can't beat Western Union ($5 and instant) then there's no reason to be here.

3. Simple, secure, and trustworthy -- The dev team needs to be extremely trustworthy.  Pre-mined coins like Ripple will be scrutinized much more than they currently are.

4. Environment Friendly -- We are already seeing this with the attention NXT is getting because it's a proof of stake coin and Ethereum looking into moving to PoS.

5. Real world use cases -- For example, Monero and Zcash being used as untraceable currencies. These will certainly survive any crash because of it.

Is there anything I'm missing?  What would be your 4 coins like the ""FANG stocks"" that will rise from the ashes and continue their growth?

Given the above list, the only two coins I see that fit the bill are Ethereum and Decred.",NA,"7hdq5j",NA,0,NA,"false",1515282989,"false","self","t5_30fo6","false","serene3","","false","true",NA,"/r/decred/comments/7hdq5j/the_coming_crash_and_crypto_20/",NA,"",NA,"Discussion","",0,1

This appears to enable DCR stakeminers to band together with commercial intent.

I won't speak to the morality of the various possibilities here. I'm just saying these possibilities appear to exist and include:

- ""DCR Funds Insurance"": get your DCR back from thieves and criminals (i.e. mini bailouts)
- ""Successful double-spending"": go on endless shopping sprees

... I'm sure you can think of other possibilities as well.

Anyway, since voting on privacy issues in Decred will be a huge deal in the future, I thought of this and if I'm understanding correctly how wallets can be attached to tickets, then I think we might see these services spring up, because it's an obvious (passive) income stream for large DCR holders, and so there's at least a short term financial incentive encouraging this behavior.

I could live with providing the service of guaranteeing your DCR back in case of a robbery, especially if it meant I'd get paid a nice level of subscription fee income just for ensuring my vote per the will of the (commercial) voting bloc.

In sum, if DCR's privacy isn't *absolute*, my impression is this sort of thing is bound to happen.",NA,"7i9sci",NA,0,NA,"false",1515300679,"false","self","t5_30fo6","false","serene3","","false","true",NA,"/r/decred/comments/7i9sci/lack_of_monero_style_privacy_means_stakeminers/",NA,"",NA,"Discussion","",0,0

Just worrying that when we do start spending dev funds that it's going to crush DCR price.

Secondly, I would highly advocate we spend on just listing on exchanges rather than on ""marketing.""  The sellers of Decred are mostly dual miners, who are going to find an exchange to sell on regardless.  Getting listed on new exchanges is ONLY going to bring in new buyers.

It's cool that I'm getting targeted Facebook ads for Decred, but getting listed on an exchange would be far more effective.  I would empty my personal pockets just to get us on Bithumb.

The idea would be to make sure that (a) we fund contractors that believe in the long-term success of the project and (b) the contractors are automatically invested in this success.

A simple version would be a contract paid out in DCR that is immediately staked, thus locking it for a mean of ~1 month per ticket. In principle, it should also be straightforward to write contracts that pay out over a longer or shorter time period, as appropriate.

The fraction of locked funds could vary based on the credibility of the contractor, so someone who has been in the community for a while would get 100% of the funds unlocked/unstaked, whereas a brand new contractor might have something more like 50/50.

There are quite a few sites showing crypto prices and related data, but I still felt it could be done better. So I worked 3 months with a friend of mine to create [CoinLib.io](https://coinlib.io/).

We tried to have a fast, mobile friendly frontpage and we think allowing you to star your favorite coins is very useful. Prices update automatically and in real-time as we pull data straight from 36+ exchanges (grows by the day). Finally we put a lot of work in the portfolio and alerting system, although it is still arguably far from perfect.

We’d love to hear some honest feedback!

I'm trying to set gominer on my windows 10 machine and I planned to use decredpool.org.

After following the guide i ended up with this config file (troncated) :

    devices=0
    ; Address of stratum pool to use.
     pool=stratum+tcp://stratum.decredpool.org:3343

    ; Username for mining pool.
    pooluser=

    ; Password for mining pool.
    poolpass=


The address is one of the 2 showned on decredpool but are supposed to be for cgminer, sgminer and nicehash.

here are the questions :

1. Does that mean that decredpool does not allow the use of gominer ? (while your guide is using it as an example... !?)

2. I get lost for the credentials :
a. What combinaison should I be using exactly ?
  user login/pass or worker's login/pass ?

3. if this still not work, what would be the best duo miner/pool with a gtx1070 ?

thanks a lot !

Decred Jesus explained that Decred users only need $1,500 to $2,000 to be able to vote.

But what's stopping someone from having multiple wallets and just barely an amount to buy 1 ticket and doing the same over and over.

Wouldn't we be back to operating like DASH?

#dcrd

This release of dcrd primarily contains performance enhancements, infrastructure improvements, and other quality assurance changes.

While it is not visible in this release, significant infrastructure work has also been done this release cycle towards porting the Lightning Network (LN) daemon which will ultimately allow LN payments to be backed by Decred.

##Notable Changes

**Faster Block Validation**

A significant portion of block validation involves handling the stake tickets which form an integral part of Decred's hybrid proof-of-work and proof-of-stake system. The code which handles this portion of validation has been significantly optimized in this release such that overall block validation is up to approximately 3 times faster depending on the specific underlying hardware configuration. This also has a noticeable impact on the speed of the initial block download process as well as how quickly votes for winning tickets are submitted to the network.

**Data Carrier Transaction Standardness Policy**

The standard policy for transaction relay of data carrier transaction outputs has been modified to support canonically-encoded small data pushes. These outputs are also known as OP_RETURN or nulldata outputs. In particular, single byte small integers data pushes (0-16) are now supported.

---

#dcrwallet

This release focuses on internal improvements to the wallet to increase code quality, thereby making it easier to add optional support for SPV syncing in a future release. As always, it also comes with bug fixes, new features and other improvements, which are detailed below.

**Bug fixes**

- Vote transactions that become invalid when the main chain tip block changes are now removed from the wallet. This allows the invalid vote to be double spent by another vote later if the ticket is picked again on a different chain.

- Ticket buyer now attempts to avoid purchasing tickets for old blocks if it is enabled while the wallet is catching up to the network.

- The application now exits cleanly if an interrupt signal (e.g. ^C or SIGINT) is received while at a prompt (such as during wallet creation, or with --promptpass) instead of hanging at the prompt.

- The application no longer refuses to start when duplicate RPC listener addresses which bind to port 0 are specified in the config.

- The listtransactions JSON-RPC has been fixed so that the order and amount values of all results match the results returned by Bitcoin Core.

- The gettransaction JSON-RPC has been fixed to return fees as negative numbers instead of positive, which matches the behavior of Bitcoin Core.

**New features**

- A new gRPC method WalletService.GetTickets has been introduced to return all wallet ticket purchases between a block range. The results are streamed to the client.

- A new gRPC method WalletService.ValidateAddress has been added with similar semantics and usage to the validateaddress JSON-RPC method. It can be used to decode an address string, ensuring that it is a valid address, as well as returning whether the address is owned by the wallet.

- A new gRPC service DecodeMessageService has been introduced to make it easier for clients not able to decode raw Decred wire messages themselves to decode a message into a gRPC message. Currently, one method exists in the service, DecodeRawTransaction, which decodes a Decred transaction.
Pagination support has been added to the WalletService.GetTransactions method through the introduction of a new target_transaction_count parameter in the request. Responses are immediately streamed to the client when the target is reached.

- The TX IPC pipe has been added (enabled with the pipetx option) to receive messages from the application by a parent process. When combined with the rpclistenerevents option, this allows the application to inform the parent process of the listener addresses used by the gRPC and JSON-RPC servers. This is especially useful when binding listeners to port 0 as the application is able to report the actual port chosen by the operating system to the parent process.

**Other improvements**

- Vendoring management of dependency source code has been switched from glide to dep. See the README.md for new build instructions.

- The BIP0044 coin type has been seamlessly upgraded from the old Decred value of 20 to 42. The new coin type is the coin type reserved for Decred in SLIP0044 and will allow greater compatibility with third party wallets. New wallets are always created with the new coin type, but for legacy compatibility old wallets and seed restores which have address usage with the old coin type will not be upgraded.

- The address discovery algorithm has been made more concurrent and should see performance improvements, especially on CPUs with high core counts.
Performance improvements were made to the WalletService.GetTransactions gRPC method by avoiding unnecessary JSON-RPC calls to dcrd.

- The ticketaddress option has been deprecated and replaced by the ticketbuyer.votingaddress option.

- Publishing duplicate vote transactions in a redundant voting wallet setup no longer logs an error for a rejected duplicate transaction.

#decrediton

This release marks a major turning point in our overall look and feel of Decrediton. We have introduced consistent header areas with a new subpage/tab interface. React-motion has been added to give a better feel for transitions from page to page and expanded area reveals. All information modals and passphrase modals have been consolidated to have a consistent feel whenever they are used.

As part of the design overhaul, the Tickets page has begun its transformation to provide a much better user experience. My Tickets subpage is the first step into giving users a clearer picture into their current staking situation. In the upcoming release, we will be adding extensive statistics and graphing to further help visualize a given users' balance and staking history. Overall, we aim to continue to add more tools that will help users' staking experience be much more enjoyable and carefree.

We have also added advanced daemon setup abilities for users that want to use remote daemons or use a different location for their blockchain data. In the next release, we plan on also adding the ability to handle advanced back-end
wallet setups: easily switch between different wallet files on the same machine, connecting to a remote wallet and other possible situations. But these advanced options will also be completely transparent for users that choose to run with the default settings.

We have added a Security Center page that will be a catch-all place to store tools that we feel have utility, but aren't needed for everyday normal wallet operation. The first 2 tools that have been added are for Signing and Verifying messages using addresses and private keys to prove ownership of a given address. Here is a typical use case: User A wants to prove to User B that they control a given address. With the Sign Message tool, User A enters the address, a message and their wallet's private passphrase. The tool produces a hash that was created based on that address' private key and the given message. With the Verify Message tool, User B can use the address in question, the hash and the message from User A to verify that it was signed using that address' private key.

We are also happy to announce the introduction of internationalization. Brazilian Portuguese has been added for the first pass and we will be slowly adding more languages on every new release.

---

Things to expect in the next release:

- New overview page design

- Rich historical Statistics/Graphs

- New staking account user experience

- Advanced wallet settings

- More languages translated

**Bug fixes**

- Fix issue on Windows caused by using ""Aux"" as a filename. 
- Aux is a restricted filename with Windows and a simple filename change fixed it.
- Fix shutdown issue with macOS. When cmd-Q or quitting Decrediton from the dock caused dcrd and dcrwallet to not be shutdown in the background. By adding a final closeClis() in app.on(""before-quit"",...) it ensures that everything is closed on any shutdown.
- Removed Skip Sync button due to the new slip44 change in dcrwallet. With the new coin type change, dcrwallet needs to check if there has been any address usage up to that point in the chain for a given wallet.
- Shorten account names in various areas to avoid obnoxious overflow.
- Fix issue that was occuring when clearing out stakepool configurations. This would cause users to possibly have incorrect stakepool setups.

- Change functionality of the space key during seed entry. Previously, when the user would enter the space key they would end up not ""selecting"" a word and then just type the whole seed. Now the space ""selects"" the word just as pressing tab does.

If that's the case then I don't see how the odds of your ticket being selected follows a Poisson. It would follow a Geometric distribution.

With a constant ticket pool size of 40960, the probability of your ticket being chosen on any given selection is (this is assuming tickets are chosen at random, and simplifying by assuming a constant pool size): 

    p=1/40960

The probability of it not being chosen is then

    1-p or 40959/40960.

That means on a k-th selection, the probability of your ticket being selected is:

    (40959/40960)^(k-1) - (40959/40960)^k

Since your ticket expires after 43,622 blocks and since there are 5 tickets selected per block, that means your ticket will expire after 218,100 selections are made, which means you have a 96.9202% chance of it getting selected before expiring and a 3.0798% chance of it not getting selected.

(The 43,622 blocks is based on the 20 hours for 256 blocks and 142 day expiration in the docs; I couldn't find the actual cutoff block count).

That's not the same as a 99.5% chance of getting selected and a 0.5% chance of not getting selected as stated in the docs.

Can anyone shed some light on the actual probabilities? It's been way too long since I took my stats class. More than likely I'm doing something wrong ;).

* Is each ticket selection truly random and independent? 
* What's the actual number of blocks before your ticket expires? Can that get added to the docs? 
* What's the median, as in, half of tickets get selected below this many blocks and half after; both Possion and Geometric generally have different enough means and medians that listing both averages in the docs would be useful.

Thanks for any clarification. Love Decred and the community around it.

Edit: For what it's worth, I think my math before was wrong as well. This seems to be the correct probabilities assuming a pool size of 40960 and tickets expiring after 40960 blocks (modeling with a geometric distribution).

* Probability ticket is selected before expiring = [99.3%](https://goo.gl/ZLYwhX)
* Median = [28391 selections, ~5678 blocks](https://goo.gl/6PrTKJ)

It starts [here](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C0NRMDVMJ/p1512466343000065) in reference to c0 and goes on for the next several hours. It was mostly between Jake and a couple community members, Dave also jumped in a few times. 

I am posting a bunch of snippets here as a summary, because I think discussions like this should get more visibility. It's this kind of deep thought about governance that drew me to Decred in the first place, and I'm sure other people would like to see it too.

I've tried to be as fair as possible to all the participants and their viewpoints, but if something doesn't seem right, please point it out in comments. Apologies in advance for editorial judgement, but I really think this is a fascinating conversation that deserves broader attention.

the wrestler [12:55 AM] 

my concern is actually that dcr's progress will not be so good after c0 releases its control

honestly, i am not sure if the mass can make as good of a decision as the dcr devs
i have a feeling that as soon as the mass gets the chance, they will want to pay all the exchanges and have dcr listed

""we have money, why not spend them all?""

&amp;nbsp;

jy-p [12:57 AM] 

i think the stakeholders are a pretty sharp bunch, i have faith that it won't just be a string of stupid decisions

there will be mistakes made, no doubt

&amp;nbsp; 

the wrestler [1:02 AM] 

dcr's philosophy is that the mass can make better decision than few individuals, but my experience has been otherwise so far lol

like that stanford experience

&amp;nbsp; 

jy-p [1:02 AM] 

you referring to the stanford prison experiment?

that was an example of what happens when you *don't* let the group make the decisions

&amp;nbsp; 

kandiru [1:03 AM] 

It's been often shown that the average guess of a group is better than any one person

For eg, guess the weight of a cow

&amp;nbsp; 

jy-p [1:05 AM] 

my view on that experiment is that it showed how important it is to have a less shitty governance system, among other things

when sovereignty rests in the hands of the few, it is a poor mechanism for governing the many

&amp;nbsp; 

the wrestler [1:09 AM] 

personally, i think there are 2 tiers to governance.  when the mass is mature, then the entire community benefits by the mass having control.  however, when the mass is immature, then the entire community benefits by the elite few having control.

&amp;nbsp; 

davecgh [1:32 AM] 

What you're largely describing though is a direct/pure democracy which has indeed been shown to fail throughout history over and over again due to what is effectively mob rule.  Decred isn't a direct democracy in large part due to that very reason.  As mentioned previously, the influence is directly proportional to the amount of skin in the game one has.  That, in turn, acts as an excellent motivator for the stakeholders who are participating to be well informed on the issues.

&amp;nbsp; 

Richard [2:35 AM] 

fwiw I regard the Stanford prison experiments and Stanley Milgram's experiments (where volunteers would ""administer electric shocks"" because an authority figure told them to) as both having something to say about authority and positions of power - being appointed to a position of power can have a corrupting influence (prison experiment), and many people will comply with authority without questioning (Milgram)

to me DCR's governance seems like a weighted form of direct democracy, power in proportion to stake but still voting directly on issues rather than electing representatives

I think longer-term there may be a role for liquid democracy, where one can either vote directly or fluidly nominate a representative who will vote on one's behalf in relation to certain topics, because as the decision-making scales up it will become harder for each stakeholder to make informed decisions on all proposals, and some proposals will fall outside their area of expertise. For technical/dev proposals I would already be doing that essentially, because I don't have the background to make an informed decision I would either abstain or vote with a community member I trust

&amp;nbsp; 

jy-p [2:55 AM] 

imo, a lot of what is wrong with nation state governance is that representatives' interests are not aligned with those that delegate their authority to them

that is exactly why i want to attempt to avoid a system of delegation when it comes to voting

""someone more knowledgeable will make the right decision"" --&gt; we're back at the nation state representative game again

&amp;nbsp; 

Richard [3:11 AM] 

that's the premise of liquid democracy, you can change your delegation at any point or over-ride your chosen delegate's vote on a particular issue if you want

it aims to capitalise on the benefits of expert representatives while diminishing the down-sides because even a powerful delegate can quickly lose power if the people who delegated to them perceive that they no longer represent their interests (as well as an alternative)

&amp;nbsp; 

jy-p [4:54 AM] 

that is exactly why i want to attempt to avoid a system of delegation when it comes to voting

""someone more knowledgeable will make the right decision"" --&gt; we're back at the nation state representative game again

where ppl act like they represent your interests, and in reality, they will auction off your sovereignty to the highest bidder

&amp;nbsp; 

Richard [4:59 AM] 

nation state representatives have fixed terms, so even if they're seen to be doing shady things it can be years before there's an opportunity to replace them, and most systems have a degree of lock-in where a political party tends to win a seat and so the party has most influence. liquid democracy should mitigate those effects, if I don't like what the person I delegated to does today I can override their vote right now or choose another representative

in practice, either way I think for a long time you'll see a lot of people, especially those who aren't so technically minded, choosing to vote in support of the c0 leaders who have been steering the ship so far when it comes to technical matters

I expect a very slow transition away from relying on c0 people, if it happens at all. I know I trust the current team and would just vote with them on anything I don't understand

&amp;nbsp; 

joshuam [5:38 AM] 

Within this lies a good rebuttal against Vlad Zamfir’s view that coin holders and users are not the same nor do their interests always align, and therefore stakeholder governance is invalid.

Assuming that most long term coin holders are likely to be users, but many users may not necessarily be long term coin holders, it is probably safe to say that those who are both using Decred as a currency and a long term store of value are most positively incentivised to see the platform continue to function and succeed. In fact, they’re likely to have two different (and perhaps even occasionally conflicting) interests.

Does that follow? There is an abundance of users who freely pass through cryptocurrencies without much concern for their overall direction, and I suspect this will become more common as x chain atomic swaps become more accessible.

I.e individuals tumbling via monero, traveling between trades through Bitcoin, or switching to a currency that a particular vendor they intend to transact with accepts

Vlad’s comments appeared to suggest the existence of a large portion of individuals who simply hoard with no intent to use. I can’t imagine this being a common scenario personally.
Perhaps there may unintentionally be many such people at the moment (whilst there are few places to spend) but if merchant adoption were to increase, I hardly believe this would be the case.

Associating voting power with holdings would certainly encourage individuals to live within their means and save more than they spend. But I’d say that’s a positive thing.

The breakdown of our block reward subsidy coupled with the fact that contributors can extract value directly from the protocol is a great argument against concerns over a permanent plutocracy emerging.

&amp;nbsp; 

davecgh [10:44 AM] 

@joshuam The primary fallacy with that line of thinking is that it assumes stakeholders are not intelligent people who can reason about the fact that making the currency better for everybody results in increasing their own value.  That is not only a pretty naive way of thinking, it's also extremely self-important.  It is basically arguing that only the chosen few (in this case, him, since he was there early enough to get some level of influence) are smart enough to make good decisions.  However, what research has shown is that when people educate themselves on a topic, as stakeholders who actually have skin in the game do, the mean guess/intuition of a group is predictably and significantly more accurate than of any single person.  I like to use the Tunisian dollar as an example because almost nobody has it.  How much do you really care about issues that affect the Tunisian dollar?  If the Republic of Tunisia were to have a vote tomorrow which result in their dollar losing half of its value overnight, how much do you personally care?  If you're being honest, the answer is going to be near zero other than recognizing that it would suck for the actual users of the currency.  On the other hand, let's consider the same scenario with USD (or whatever currency that you primarily use) and suddenly now you become very interested in finding out more, educating yourself, and trying to prevent it from happening, because it affects you personally.

&amp;nbsp; 

davecgh [11:16 AM] 

I personally think comparing it to corporations is a much more accurate comparison.  Yes, corporations market to the masses, and certainly the stakeholders are ""marketed"" to in order to try and get support, but I think it's hard to argue with the success that large corporations have had.  Most of the large ones are worth more than the vast majority of countries.

I also agree that smaller stakeholders probably won't spend much time on most issues, and that's perfectly fine since they don't have as much influence.

The data in this report is from 11/20/17 to 12/20/17. 

In total, our ad spend was around $3k for that time period. 

We advertised on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Google Search, Google Display, and YouTube. (I'm going to type some more stats before I upload the PDF so hold on...) 

We achieved 455,478 impressions across platforms so 1000 impressions cost $6.58

There were 6,129 clicks, making the overall cost per click about $0.49. This includes platform specific clicks, like 'clicks' to the Twitter or Facebook pages

There were 130 website conversion, 166 Facebook likes, and 58 Twitter followers directly paid for by the clicks (you must assume there were many more associated site conversions, follows, and likes that were not directly associated to the click as well, but were a byproduct of them)

If you count each of the above as a conversion, we had 354 conversions, with a cost per conversion of $8.47

Some of the conversion data is shaky because we had to use Piwik goals instead of official conversion tracking codes (ie. the Facebook tracking pixel, Adwords conversion code, etc.)
So keep in mind, we did not perform ANY optimizations on ads yet, we wait to get a large enough sample size of data before we begin optimizing. January will be our first month making optimizations and beginning to release new ads.

In summary, since this is pre-optimization, assume the following as a 'worst case':

For every $1,000 we spend on ads, we can expect to receive 150K+ impressions, 2K+ clicks, and 120+ 'conversions'.

I've noticed the payout threshold is so high, I'll have to wait several days, or perhaps a week, before I get anything into my wallet.

With many other coins, on the pools mentioned above and on several others, the payout threshold is such that I get payouts several times a day, and the fees are still reasonable.

It's not my hash rate, because I use the same GPUs and miners for all coins (currently I mine DCR with ccminer-tpruvot).

It's not how often the pool finds new blocks, because it does find at least several blocks per day.

The minimum fee is just very high compared to my daily earnings.

The reason being that Binance wants a something like $200k listing fee, and it was thought it'd be better to put a decision that big up to a community vote.

However, I've also heard that negotiating the Binance listing fee down is quite common. That got me thinking, how do you negotiate something like this in a decentralized and transparent manner?

That got me thinking, and I've come up with one method for doing so:

Company A makes a proposal for X, bidding Y dollars.

Decred stakeholders then vote on the proposal, yes or no. Depending on the outcome of the vote, we then make a counteroffer that company A can take or leave. The stakeholder counteroffer would be $0 at 0% stakeholder approval, Company A's initial offer at 75% stakeholder approval, and scaling linearly in between.

For example, let's say Binance proposes $100k for listing. The proposal for funding gets 50% vote approval. That makes our counteroffer *$66.k* ($100k * 50/75), which Binance can then take or leave.

I think something like this could allow us to negotiate in a decentralized way, and have some flexibility with negotiating costs, without having to either accept a companies initial (possibly overpriced) proposal or leave it outright.

This is a pretty simple explanation of my thoughts, let me know what you guys think.

The possible reasons for wanting to fork the codebase that I was able to think of ultimately boil down to
-not agreeing with the dev premine
-disagreeing with the outcome of a future vote

To me, the dev premine is small enough to be considered a reward/payment for creating the network and an incentive to keep improving it. Disagreeing with the outcome of a future vote could be enough reasoning for a codebase fork, however any change will be backed by most of the coin holders.

Everyone who currently holds coins is okay with the premine, otherwise they would not have bought said coins. The main issue with forking the codebase at this point is that it will require a brand-new airdrop for the new coin to be distributed.  I think that this late in the crypto game a successful airdrop would be hard to pull off.

To my second point, if a group is really angered enough by a passed vote to fork the codebase, they will run into the issue above, as well as only having a maximum 25% community support because it takes at least 75% to pass a vote. 

I think that the probability of a Decred codebase fork succeeding is low. Once all of the DAO pieces are in place, Decred should be nimble and adaptable enough to compete with the tech of any coin, and that it is one of few coins that will be around for the long haul.

    Will Obelisk mine on its hardware?
    Obelisk intends to operate up to but not exceeding 20% of the 
    hashrate of every cryptocurrency for which we make chips

How does the ASIC purchasing community and the Decred community feel about this? 

The Obelisk team funded the development of the ASICs from the mining communities and will undoubtedly profit on the sales. They will also reap 20% of all block rewards for the respective currencies. In the world of GPU mining this would be a mining software that has a 20% dev fee built in (for which you paid $2500 to buy upfront). Nobody would use it. 

What checks and balances are there to make sure that they are only hashing 20%? What if they hash 30%? What if they decide to hash 51% to sabotage Decred? They are the team behind Sia and not Decred, there is less of a vested interest in the well being of the Decred ecosystem.  

All of this is aside from the concerns of the raw centralization that these ASICs will introduce once produced. Is it time for the community to discuss a proposal to protect the ecosystem?

Your ticket basically enters a big lottery where it has a chance of being drawn to vote. Each block picks 5 tickets, and there are around 40k tickets total at any given time. On average, it takes about a month for a tickets to get picked to vote, bit it could be a lot faster or slower. When your ticket votes, you get your subsidy (1.35 DCR) as well as the amount you paid for the ticket back. When tickets are voting they are all securing the network by approving blocks, which is like an additional layer of security above pure PoW.

Currently, some staking pools price entry at ~86, which is determined by the pricing algorithm which tries to keep the # of tickets stable around 40k. More demand = more expensive tickets. There are people working in ticket sharing &amp; microstaking which should make things easier for folks with smaller balances.

Something to consider before buying a ticket is that the durtion your funds are locked up is random, it could take 4 months, so be aware in case you want more liquidity.

From what I understand about Decred it's a coin with autonomous governance where stake holders can vote and have control over the direction of the project.


My question is- How is the governance thing is really working?


It seems to me that voting is made automatically for me via a pool and not really reflecting anything but my desire to get the reward for the voting. I am buying tickets few months now and never had any control in the direction of the coin that I know of.


Where can I participate in discussion related to decred governance decisions/suggestions? It's sounds like a significant and importand part of the project and yet I can't really find the meat of it in reality.


What am I missing?

&amp;nbsp; For now, would Decred contributors please help to create a list of exchanges that we have applied to and their current statuses? It may very well be that they have some unreasonable demands.  If so, what are they?  Are they simply not responding?

This might be asking a lot or it might be impossible since no one is required to take the time to divulge what has been done and I don't know whether or not exchanges commonly require NDAs.  I know that a lot of people would highly appreciate a little more info and I'm willing to help in any way I can.  Perhaps the only way forward is to start applying and create a list from scratch.  We can do that if necessary but I hope not since I believe some significant amount of work has already been done in this area.

Luxor is a consortium of blockchain based products and services.  We got our start with Sia and expanded into Decred.  We plan on adding more altcoins we believe in and would like to support with our commitment to giving back 10% of the fees to the community.  For Sia, it was a cold-wallet owned by the devs, for Decred it will be an address which will be governed by a Politea proposal.  The first proposal will most likely go towards paying the Binance listing fee.

"485335",1515715126,"decred","hashfunction8","self.decred","https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/7psibt/confused_about_digital_scarcity/",13,14,NA,NA,"Confused about digital scarcity","I've been thinking more about cryptocurrency as a store of value, including listening/reading some material from a few key folks in the field (Nick Szabo and Ari Paul are the two I've enjoyed most on this topic). Most recently, I saw this exchange on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Ataraxia_Invest/status/951557032473190400

I have come away from thinking about this topic pretty confused, in particular in the context of Decred or other ""smaller"" cryptocurrency projects.

The value proposition of cryptocurrency seems to revolve in part around the concept of digital scarcity -- that something like bitcoin can be a limited resource, and therefore hold value. The comparison is often to gold, which is scarce just because there's a limited amount of it on Earth, and new gold is exponentially hard to mine.

The argument against this is that the code underlying cryptocurrencies is generally open source (and pretty much has to be -- closed source cryptocurrency would be a giant security risk, among other issues), meaning that the code can be copied and another currency can be started without spending a lot of resources. This can include forks, but also copies of the code and a restart of the blockchain, and everything in between. So, from a code and physical resources perspective, there is no scarcity.

So, it seems that scarcity comes from network effects -- from everyone *agreeing* that X is valuable, and therefore it is. The question is, then, why can't everyone change their minds? The thread I linked to above includes an argument that this is similar to trying to use another metal instead of gold to store value. However, that's very much not the case, because no other metal has the same properties as gold: gold is uniquely stable (doesn't corrode), is quite scarce compared to most metals, yet not so scarce that no one can ever mine any more. You can't make a duplicate copy of gold, call it ""gold cash"", and convince everyone to use that instead of gold as a store of value. However, you absolutely can do that with bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. Even if there's existing infrastructure -- miners, payment portals, etc., a perfect copy of the currency code would be compatible with all of that infrastructure.

So, I think we're down to *only* the network effect (the name recognition of a currency and the trust in its fair distribution) as the origin of digital scarcity. That is pretty scary even for bitcoin, but is even more scary for something like Decred which has a smaller network effect compared to dozens of cryptocurrencies. 

So, for example: imagine someone clones Decred's code, but instead of doing a fork, all accounts are wiped out and the holders are replaced by holders of bitcoin, proportional to their bitcoin holdings (a type of airdrop). The new currency is called ""Bitcoin Decred"". The code is as good as it was before, with all of the same features, but now the network effect is much stronger. (Perhaps doing this would require changing the hash algorithm so as to not make all the bitcoin asics obsolete?). Doesn't this immediately kill Decred? 

This class of attacks seem to be a significant problem, without an obvious resolution. There needs to be *something* about the existing project/history/userbase that is uniquely valuable and can't be replicated -- and it's not clear to me what that something is in Decred, or in any other cryptocurrency (other than maybe bitcoin and Ethereum, given their large network effects).

Am I misunderstanding something? Are there any ways to secure Decred against such an attack beyond just strengthening the name recognition and the network effect? A couple months ago I proposed a secondary airdrop to try to capture the network effect of some of the larger cryptocurrencies (https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/7ccyov/secondary_smallamount_airdrop_to_increase_the/). This suggestion was not well received, but I'm not sure what other ways there are to inoculate Decred against this type of attack.

1. Other cryptocurrencies are beginning to crowd the ""credits"" namespace (see: [a](https://credits.com/), [b](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/verify/))

I'd like to ignore all that for a moment to discuss the feasibility of using DCR as an actual currency for everyday use.

There are to me still many problems in the crypto space that still need resolving if you agree with the idea of crypto overtaking banking institutions. If not then this post might not be for you as a lot of my questions revolve around how the software can do the bank's job.

A few examples:

- if someone dies or has an accident what can be done to transfer funds to a next of kin?

- what measures are put in place to lock down accounts subjected to fraud or theft? For example the famous mtgox case, if users were able to self mark their transactions as theft maybe it would have prevented the mtgox coins from being distributed in the ecosystem or given other users the knowledge and choice to accept marked coins. Another example being where someone's wallet has been stolen. What measures are being put in place to flag the account as having coins stolen to prevent further damage.

- What theft/fraud protections are coming to the system? For example my bank has spending limits I can setup, along with notifications on any transactions that happen. Will such restrictions ever be put on the chain so that transactions can be marked invalid?

- Another example of the same above point. A lot of software has a rating for fraud levels. For example if all my actions have been in the UK and suddenly I'm asking to transfer all my money to a different account in Brazil the transaction will be rejected as the fraud scoring will be too high. Will we be seeing anything similar to this as it may help with my next example..

- What protections can be put in place to prevent what has happened with bitcoin where there are people getting kidnapped and forced to transfer their entire wallet?

- Can anything be done to prevent money laundering and other illegal activities which is something a lot of governments care about in a distributed manner to prevent a single point of control. Perhaps again this comes down to the marking of coins and for people to make a choice of accepting them or not.

Is anyone doing any work around this or even discussing it? To me it seems that everyone is so focused on treating crypto like an asset rather than a currency that no work is ever done outside of the trading space.

Perhaps most people would prefer to keep the banks and have the currency treated just as that, but then my counter point would be that crypto offers very little over fiat at that point.",NA,"7tjftt",NA,0,NA,"false",1518594482,"false","self","t5_30fo6","false","serene3","","false","true",NA,"/r/decred/comments/7tjftt/decred_as_a_useable_currency_for_everyday_life/",NA,"",NA,"Discussion","",0,0

Instead of expensive, exhaustive marketing campaigns. We, as a community, should consider to build viral marketing tactics into the Decred technology itself.

After lengthy discussions with several marketing experts, I can confidently say that the Decred community can grow to tens of millions of participants pretty quickly in the next couple years, but we need to make progressive marketing decisions. From our perspective, in order to grow, two things need to be done with a powerful and elegant User Experience (high-quality UX is imperative as it is considerably lacking in every corner of the blockchain landscape): 1) Financially incentivize new members (give them money) and 2) empower all new community members to vote and share their opinion (give them purpose). If you think about it, all people want is money, purpose, or both. Most want both. In order to give money and purpose to newcomers, we’d like to propose ways to 1) financially reward newcomers and 2) get newcomers involved more easily.

1. Financially-incentivize newcomers: Staking is the true innovation with Decred. It is this feature that allows Decred to be malleable, as we all well know. We propose the Decred system takes a portion of the Voting Reward from Stakers and strategically uses it to incentivize new community members to download Decrediton and start engaging in governance via Politeia. Maybe the breakdown ends up being something like 8/12 for Miners, 3/12 for Stakeholders and 1/12 for Marketing/Engagement. With this 1/12 of all Decred rewards in our “Community Wallet"", AS A COMMUNITY we can all approach certain entities to formulate strategic partnerships. On a daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly basis, the community can vote on who to approach (this will also get great press). Together, as one voice, we can say to anyone: “We’d like you to join the Decred community as a strategic/honorary partner and as an honorary member of our community, this is what we expect from you…” Imagine if we could build this kind of marketing structure into the protocol itself. The communities and people we could directly engage would be decredibly powerful. CoinDesk every week/month would announce our new partnership.

2. Get newcomers involved in voting immediately: If you can’t buy a ticket, then you’re useless in terms of voting power. We propose that the 1/12 of the reward that is used for marketing needs to allow people to be able to vote immediately. For example, if 1/12 monthly reward is dispersed across all students at the University of Chicago, then each undergrad should have the ability to vote and impact direction of the protocol immediately. As Naval says, “Even though you may not want to hear it, I think everyone has the right to say something.” We propose allowing for off-chain voting with ticket prices much less (maybe 1/1000) of a whole ticket. The majority count will submit a full ticket to the blockchain. This engages newcomers immediately with voting ability, and entitles them to a small PoS reward.

I assume it works something like this:

The input:

* Tickets (hashes of all live your live tickets)
* Id of Proposal ( ? )
* Your Choice (""yes/no"")
* Proof of Ownership (your private key signs a hash of the above inputs)

The output:

* A signature that proves you are the one who purchased the tickets and shows what your choice is for a given proposal.

Please correct/expand on this rough outline if you have info to share.

There may be utility in snap voting beyond the context of proposals in Politeia. So I'm wondering if the ""Id of Proposal"" input can be generic? For example, if I wanted to build a system that polls decred stakeholders if they like cats or dogs, could the proposal id just be ""CatOrDog""? Then in a similar manner to how the snap voting proofs are submitted to and parsed by Politiea, it seems users could then submit their snap vote to any system capable of counting the votes. I'm also very curious how the counting of votes works. 

I'm starting on a prototype for the upcoming [Politeia Challenge](https://blog.decred.org/2017/11/03/Politeia-Platform-Challenge/) in February so any details are greatly appreciated.

We have two primary goals with this pool:

* make staking more user-friendly for Decred newcomers
* provide helpful ROI charts to investor minded people


We are a handful of cryptoheads passionate about Decred. Most of us have been involved into Decred for many years and we want to help it grow.

Other projects we are doing include:

* [charts.dcr.farm](https://charts.dcr.farm) - all kinds of charts about Decred (economics, technical, market, etc.)
* [explorer.dcr.farm](https://explorer.dcr.farm) - a simple blockchain explorer for Decred
* [seed.dcr.farm](https://seed.dcr.farm) - a full node with unlimited bandwidth to help seed other nodes


There are many more to come. The stakepool itself will also see new features over the coming months... stay tuned.

In order to preserve decentralization, we'll shut off signups if the pool exceeds 15% of the tickets.


If you've got any questions please fire away.

Good luck and happy staking!

"531624",1516945168,"decred","hashfunction8","self.decred","https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/7t2kfc/taxation_of_cryptocurrency_usa/",29,42,NA,NA,"Taxation of cryptocurrency (USA)","I recently listened to a very informative podcast episode of Unchained, published Jan 23, 2018, on which editor Laura Shin spoke with tax experts Tyson Cross and Jason Tyra regarding cryptocurrency taxes.

Since tax season is coming up, I took notes on this episode for myself, summarizing all of the relevant information that might help do taxes properly, and I figured I would share them. I added my own notes and clarifications [in brackets] here for reference. Note: I am neither a lawyer nor a tax expert, so take the bracketed information with the appropriate grain of salt. 


* The speakers suggest using bitcoin.tax and/or cointracking.info to calculate taxes -- apparently they work quite well.

* IRS uses the term ""virtual currency"" rather than cryptocurrency, and considers it property (per Notice 2014-21). There has been no additional guidance since 2014. This makes the tax treatment virtual currencies similar to that of stocks or bonds, where an analogy can be made. However, the analogy can break down because virtual currency is more fungible than stocks or bonds, which can typically just be bought/sold on one exchange, and can be further complicated by smart contracts, etc.

* There are no tax consequences if you are just holding a virtual currency and doing nothing with it. Taxation only occurs during some sort of buy/sell. Withdrawing your coins from an exchange or vice versa is /not/ a taxable event (though this is sometimes misreported by tax guidance provided by exchanges), and neither is moving coins from exchange to exchange. In general, moving from one address to another address is not a taxable event as long as you are the owner of both addresses.

* In trades, you need to know when you made the purchase, the price at which you bought the asset, when you sold it, and at what price

* You should keep track of the above information as best as possible. Exchanges will generally provide you with the information on buy/sell dates and price, but not always, and you are at the risk of the exchange going under. Also, certain more-complex trades (e.g., margin trades) could be inconsistently reported. Things like shapeshift provide no records, so you have to track everything yourself.

* Coinbase will provide you with a tax report based on your activity [like Fidelity or Vanguard would], but /this information is often wrong and should not be used/! Only look at the specific information about buy/sell dates and prices, and do your own tax calculations or use specialized software or an account.

* Every exchange of virtual currency is a taxable event, including buying things with a virtual currency or exchanging one virtual currency for another. [The way to think about it is if you own bitcoin and buy Decred with it on an exchange, it is treated as if you sold your bitcoin for USD (taxable event), and then bought Decred with that USD.]

* Virtual currency may or may not be considered ""like kind property"", and it takes a pretty in-depth analysis to try to determine what is considered ""like kind"" or not. The tax experts suggest you do not treat virtual currency as ""like kind"" to avoid potential penalties, litigation, etc. Furthermore, starting in 2018, there is no more ambiguity, because the new tax law restricts ""like kind"" to only real estate. Finally, if you DO want to try to claim crypto-to-crypto trades in 2017 and earlier as ""like kind"", you still have to report the exchanges on your tax return, so this does not decrease the reporting headache.

* Ignorance of tax law, even if the tax law is confusing or hard to comply with, is not a valid reason to underpay taxes [this is true for any US laws in general]

* If you buy, e.g., bitcoin multiple times over a period of time, and then you sell some, what do you consider your cost basis (the price at which you bought)? The IRS does not specify how you match buys and sells, as long as they are the same amount. That means you can do ""first in, first out"" (cost basis will be the price at oldest purchase), ""last in, first out"" (cost basis will be the price at most recent purchase), cherrypicking by hand works. You do /not/ have to stick to one of these rules; you can mix and match, if you want. The tax professionals generally recommend ""first in, first out"" for simplicity, even if it doesn't always result in the lowest tax outcome.

* Even if the IRS currently does not provide specific guidance (for FIFO vs LIFO, or regarding ""like kind"", etc), they could provide guidance down the line, and these rules could be applicable /retroactively/. This means you if you used the wrong interpretation, you would have to go back and amend your tax returns. [I was very surprised by this because it sounds like an ex-post-facto law, but the reasoning that was provided was that these are new /interpretations/ of existing law, not new law] Having said that, the tax experts seem to think that the IRS would probably not apply new interpretations retroactively, but would instead look forward.

* Service/trading/transaction fees either reduce your basis [if during a buy] or can be deducted from the gains.

* For hard forks, the suggestion is that new coins that you acquire via a hard fork be treated as a capital asset with a basis of 0, starting the holding period from the moment of the hard fork (resulting on eventual long- or short-term capital gains tax when it is finally sold). 

* For an air drop, where you have to do something when you participate in the air drop, the coins received should probably be considered /ordinary income/ at the time they are received, establishing the basis. Then there is capital gains/loss from there. 

* If you are issuing a new coin yourself (e.g., an ICO), then either it is a security -- and you have to register with the SEC -- or it's a product, and then you have to pay taxes on revenue.

* If you are mining, then the coins you get are ordinary income. [I assume they were thinking about PoW mining, because it feels to me like PoS mining is more like a dividend than ordinary income? Personally, I plan to report my Decred PoS as a dividend, unless I see a good reason to treat it as ordinary income, but that's just me.]

* If you give your virtual currency to someone as a gift, it is tax free up to the rules established by the gift-tax limit, which is $14,000 per person per year, under which you do not have to report anything. The recipient gets a carry-over basis from you, so you need to tell the giftee what you paid for the coins. Beyond the 14K/year/person limit, there is a lifetime exemption limit of $11 million if you are single, and you have to file a gift-tax return, but you still do not owe taxes. 

* If you lose your virtual currency, it is not easy to determine if it is a theft loss or a casualty loss, or capital loss. If you qualify for a deduction, then the loss is based on what you /paid/ for the coins, not their present worth. Furthermore, casualty loss deduction is going away in 2018 and beyond due to the new tax bill. You might also be able to abandon your property, and take a capital loss for the abandonment. [I am out of my depth here, so if you are interested in this, you should go listen yourself or investigate elsewhere]

* Wash sale rules do not apply to virtual properties, unless they are securities. [This seems complex and I don't want to try to summarize, but it sounds like there might be ways to get a tax advantage here, if you are smart/careful]

* Using an LLC to trade does not make things more straightforward/easier

Obviously a lot of us are here because we believe that the Decred PoS/PoW hybrid model (Based on PoActivity) is the most favourable system in regards to decentralisation, censorship resistance, autonomy and security. I was just wondering whether there were any other less or more favourable consensus systems amongst the community that (subjectively) also provide great degrees of decentralisation, censorship resistance, autonomy and security. 

The only other notable one for me would be pure PoW, both with ASICs and ASIC resistance. 

I am currently investigating further into DPoS systems so would appreciate any knowledge/opinions others had on those. Especially as I know there a lots of variations on that system.

So far pure PoBurn and PoCapacity don't seem serious problem solvers at all to me. And the basic architecture of PoS also doesn't really appeal to me but I haven't yet taken the time to read into, for eg. how exactly Ethereum or Cardano hope to implement, so I may still be very uninformed.

Currently, the majority of live Decred tickets are staked at a very limited number of stakepools. Keeping this in mind, we felt the need to develop a low fee yet high quality pool that will further help with decentralization of the Decred network.

Our pool depends on multiple high quality servers distributed at points over 3 different continents and more than 13000+ kilometers apart. This will ensure that there are always multiple wallets online, ready to vote on your behalf whenever your tickets get called.


Pool’s features 

*  A low fee of only 1% !
*  Fully detailed tutorial (Video coming soon)
*  Detailed pool statistics 
*  Support through email or telegram available in three languages (English/Russian/Arabic)
*  Easy to access from any device 


***As part of our contribution to the decentralization of Decred, we will close registrations at our pool once its share of the network is at 15%.***

Your feedback is more than welcome. Also, If you have any feature that you would love to see implemented, please do not hesitate to tell us by commenting below or via email: decred@raqamiya.net.

&gt; For instance, last year saw swaps between different blockchains built on similar code – the cryptocurrencies decred, litecoin and bitcoin – executed.

Nice seeing Decred being mentioned before Litecoin and Bitcoin. 

Decred focuses on decentralizing everything, from governance all the way to trading its tokens.

Centralized exchanges such as Binance are horrible. I hope 2018 will be year where DEX (decentralized exchanges) makes a break through so that everyone can permissionless and trustless swap currencies. We are in dire need of removing exchanges power.

Buying at first, then getting into mining as a hobby. It's hands down my favorite coin, and I hope to follow it's progress through 2018.

I only have a 970m, so I'm not really making a profit. But I'd like to mine a little more seriously. I came across the dedicated ASIC miners, read about the whole fiasco with SIA and the SC 1, but found nothing about the DCR 1. The price for one is reasonable, and not much more than I'd spend on a number of other hobbies.  I'm not trying to start a farm to get rich quick. If the miner I buy pays for itself I'll be happy for the experience.

Is anyone still considering one of these? Are there chinese knockoffs that are going to blow up the hashrate on the Decred network? It doesn't look like it so far. SIA's difficulty has skyrocketed and Decred's has remained pretty low.

I am new to Decred and I have a simple question:

At https://dcrstats.com/pow one can see that coinmine.pl/dcr owns 58% of the hashing power. That quite startled me, and after some googling I came to the conclusion that for someone to be able to pull a successful 51% attack on decred they need 51% hashing power AND 51% tickets for the PoS part of consensus. 

So essentially even if you own a majority of the hash power you also need to own the majority of the tickets, which is much more expensive?

Please correct me where I'm wrong, I'm writing this pretty late and I might be missing something. ",NA,"7sijy5",NA,0,NA,"false",1518575982,"false","self","t5_30fo6","false","serene3","","false","true",NA,"/r/decred/comments/7sijy5/51_attack/",NA,"",NA,"Discussion","",0,0

This question gets asked enough, I thought I'd make a short post answering it:

Decred uses a hybrid Proof-of-Work/Proof-of-Stake system. Stakers participate through ""tickets"", which are randomly drawn to ""vote"". Each block picks 5 tickets at random to vote.

Every block requires at least 3 of the 5 votes to approve it. If we (the stakeholders) don't like something a miner is doing, we can decide to not approve the block &amp; the miner does not get the mining subsidy. So for example if Antpool wants to mine empty blocks, we can decide to not approve them &amp; take their subsidy away.

This is is already built into Decred and is a fundamental part of our hybrid PoW/PoS system.

Miners mine the blocks, stakers validate them.",NA,"7six8n",NA,0,NA,"false",1518576170,"false","self","t5_30fo6","false","serene3","","false","true",NA,"/r/decred/comments/7six8n/what_happens_if_bitmain_makes_a_decred_asic_and/",NA,"The Suppressor",NA,"Discussion","",0,1

We'd then use Politeia to govern the projects, effectively reusing Decred's existing infrastructure to grow the system's use cases with the primary goal of enhancing the passive income stream earned by Decred stakeminers.

Stakemining ICOs has the primary benefit of magnifying the passive income stream of stakemining DCR: it augments it with autonomously distributed metacoins. For a brief overview of metacoins, see [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2is4us/whats_wrong_with_counterparty/cl4zmmk/) by Vitalik Buterin:

&gt; Colored coins was an awesome idea, and I applaud everyone who worked on it from 2010-2013, but my personal opinion is that XCP-style meta-consensus systems are the next generation from here, at least as far as Bitcoin-based protocols are concerned.

Stakemining ICOs has the secondary benefit of meaningfully competing against the very *concept* of the ICO, which has gone completely unchallenged on the open market.

But first, **why should we compete against ICOs**? What's not to like?!

Well, you can start with the fact ICO promoters are raising vast sums of money *up front* from the public for all manner of questionable endeavors with no oversight and no strings attached. This is extremely problematic from a consumer protection standpoint, hence the onerous regulations around [securities offerings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUVlatCvp0).

In effect, *investors* in ICOs shoulder all of the risk, while project founders are allowed to dance their way to instant millions.

Today, ICOs are essentially solving problems for project founders, in that they answer the question of how do you get your hands on as much of other peoples money as you possibly can, as quickly as you can, and with utter freaking impunity.

Conversely, with ""stakemining ICOs"", up-front lump-sum fundraising rounds are replaced with airdrops to existing Decred stakeholders, such that DCR ticket holders acquire these newly created tokens with a cost basis of effectively $0.

Then, in order to raise money for ongoing project development, the project founders of stakemined tokens, get this, *ask* for *reasonable amounts of money*, money which is taken out of Decred's 10% pooled block rewards.

An analogy might be public defense spending, where communal funds (raised through taxes) are spent on public works projects intended to benefit the stakeholders in the state.

Imagine Politeia being used to govern these *would-be ICOs*, whilst Decred ticket holders receive tokens through ongoing airdrops in proportion to their tickets held. This might be a ""cloud storage"" token, or a ""blockchain AirBNB token""; and so on and so forth.

Airdropping these metacoins to DCR ticket holders provides the financial incentive for stakeminers to earmark communal funds for these projects, which enables open innovation on Decred's blockchain within reasonable bounds. The chief aim is to challenge the concept of the ICO, whilst growing the use cases of Decred, all without ever asking the public for a lump sum of money up front.

TLDR; Decred has the power to turn would-be hyped up ICOs into closely controlled public works projects developed for the benefit of ticket holders.",NA,"7pbqmm",NA,0,NA,"false",1518516208,"false","self","t5_30fo6","false","serene3","","false","true",NA,"/r/decred/comments/7pbqmm/stakemining_icos_on_decred_revisited/",NA,"",NA,"Discussion","",0,0

I bought it yesterday through the latest version of Decrediton and today it is showing as Revoked. 

Is that because of something I did wrong? When will the DCR be unlocked so I can try again? Have I lost any amount of DCR because of this, like a transaction fee? Why does this happen to a new ticket? 

This was not my first ticket purchases in this version of the wallet and far from my first purchase on the pool I'm using. It is the first time I have had this issue after many successful votes. I am still waiting on a few tickets that have been waiting to vote for over 7 weeks but I understand that is normal. Help me understand what the cause of this Revoked ticket is so I can avoid it in the future.

[Edit]
From what I can gather it looks like I just got very unlucky, getting one of the very few tickets missed by my pool. Looks like this should happen mathematically one time every 2,400 tickets based on my pools missing ticket rate of 0.0417%

* Address version for the Pubkeyhash and P2SH.
* Privatekey version for WIF purposes etc.
* Magic bytes for block transmission.

These parameters for the 3 networks (Mainnet, Testnet and Simnet) would be cool to find (i found mainnet and testnet on decred's bitcore port, but can't seem to find simnet).

I am not sure how big of a change this idea I'm proposing is, but can the algorithm be modified to increase staking rewards/ROI during times of distress? This not only secures the network, but also provides further price stability.

* From an economic standpoint, this is a real issue that needs to be addressed **now** (IMO): What is my incentive to continue staking when the price declines too much? You can make the argument that a staker's incentive is the same as that of a miner's who's mining a ""loss-making"" cryptocoin. However, a miner can simply switch to a more profitable cryptocoin... someone staking DCR can't.
* Implementing the logic to reward stakers [a little bit extra] during times of distress will further differentiate DCR.

Be as respectful and nice as possible. This discussion has potential to be more emotionally charged as it may bring up issues that are upsetting. Many people are not only financially but also emotionally invested in the ideas and tools of the project.

**How it works:**

Post your concerns about Decred in reply to this thread.

Upvote the comments that contain the most valid criticisms, or the ones that have few or no real honest solutions/answers to them. 

As a community, as developers, we need to know about them. Even if they make us feel bad, we will have the opportunity to solve them in the future.

The comments that mention the biggest shortcomings of Decred should have the most upvotes. If you want to add further details, reply to that comment. Let's keep the thread structured and clear.

In order to keep things calm and organized, I thought it would be a good idea to gather all the skepticism in one thread. This idea was already implemented by the Monero community with great success. This is their first edition:

I would be interested in knowing stakeholder thoughts on a media bounty for news publications. This is a spare of the moment thought so please feel free to pick holes in the idea.

When it comes to media exposure we face two problems:
Centralised ICO entities, with large marketing departments, and even bigger marketing budgets, buying coverage. &amp; Publications shilling investments in the media, Tezos is a good example of this.

With a decentralised project, like Decred, I think a Media Bounty could really benefit in allowing us to gain exposure as and when it is needed, and could offer an additional cost effective tool, that would aim to complement the great work already done by community members that promote Decred.

The media bounty could open approx 1-2 week before milestone releases, Politeia release, DAE release, Hardfork votes, Proposal votes, and could close 1-2 weeks after the release.

The bounty program would be accessible to reporters from publications (Coindesk, Cointelegraph, Forbes etc), and bounty rewards could be calculated by metrics defined by the Decred community...
... The benefits of this would be that publications who earn bounty rewards may become hodlers, hodlers who may be encouraged to publicise Decred outside of Bounty Program windows.

Before participating, Bounty Program participants would be required to join a communications channel, say, a Media Bounty Program Slack channel. It would be here where Bounty Program announcements would be made first, opening dates, closing dates etc..
.. The idea behind on-boarding reporters onto an active Slack community, would be that they are more likely to engage more with the Decred community and increased engagement may lead to increased exposure.

Edit: Participants also don't have any ""skin in the game"" when it comes to receiving Media Bounty Rewards, maybe a solution to this could be that all participants enter into a draw to receive their reward?

I would be interested to hear your thoughts. Cheers.",NA,"7vfw6v",NA,0,NA,"false",1520491386,"false","self","t5_30fo6","false","serene5","","false","true",NA,"/r/decred/comments/7vfw6v/media_bounty/",NA,"",NA,"Opinion","",0,0

So I picked up another ticket today for a little over 85 DCR. Love the process and the wallet is very easy to use. I get a say in the Decred Project which is huge.

Quick question though:

I checked on another ticket that has been out for awhile. As most of my tickets vote in under 28 days. I know the probabilities as they have been explained to be before and I have read up on all of it. 

My question is this: I took out a ticket on Dec 12th. Is it fair to say it the probability of it voting is now 144days max from that date in order to get my DCR back to buy another ticket. 

This is my understanding. That it has a 99.5% chance to vote in the first 28 days and the .5% chance in taking 144 days. If it isn't selected in the 144 days the fee is lost (no big deal) and the DCR is returned to be able to vote again. 

Correct? Feel free to correct me if I left something out or butchered the whole voting breakdown.

Really the only ones that seem completed are Hard Fork Voting and L/N Support. 




Convert Decred into a stakeholder-directed DAO - While other projects have attempted to create a DAO via a monolithic smart contract, Decred will build a DAO in several steps, ensuring each component works independently before putting it into production.


Hard fork voting - Stakeholders will be able to vote on all hard fork changes to Decred, with only those changes obtaining greater than 75% support being activated.


Public proposal system - After hard fork voting is in production, we will create an off-chain system where Decred users can submit proposals for future work to be performed by the development organization, Decred Holdings Group (“dev org” or “DHG”).


Decentralized control of DHG funds - Currently, the control of DHG funds is centralized, and this will be resolved by creating a system whereby control of these funds is decentralized, e.g. based on stakeholder voting.
Lightning Network support - The lightning network is the most directly useful application of smart contracts to date since it allows for off-chain transactions that optionally settle on-chain. This infrastructure has clear benefits for both scaling and privacy.


Improved GUI wallets - We have made substantial progress with GUIs, Paymetheus (Windows) and decrediton (Windows, OS X, and Linux), and will continue to improve the user experience.


RFP process change - To date, the RFP process has involved giving quotes on deliverable sets, and this system is cumbersome to administrate and maintain. The RFP process will change to one where individuals and businesses will be contracted on a longer term basis to work for the project. As part of the RFP changes, we will be looking for contractors to do marketing, advertising, documentation and community management work.


Presence at events - With hard fork voting nearly ready for production, we have some legitimately interesting content to discuss at events. Our presence at events will ramp up starting in late Q1 2017.


Enhanced privacy - Starting in late Q2 or early Q3 2017, we will propose a new initiative to enhance user privacy.
Payment integration support - Instead of only focusing on Decred from a speculative position, we will support efforts to integrate Decred as a payment method for businesses starting in Q1 2017.",NA,"7x7rmo",NA,0,NA,"false",1520528116,"false","self","t5_30fo6","false","serene3","","false","true",NA,"/r/decred/comments/7x7rmo/critical_view_on_decred/",NA,"",NA,"Discussion","",0,0

Is there a planned date for when the 'DAO' or 'DAE' funding and voting system will be introduced?
What will be the requirements to vote on proposals?
What are the current requirements with Politea? Is this even active? Or is this just the test right now for what will be coming?

I can see almost 50% of the supply is locked up for voting/staking rewards, Will the requirement of a vote be different compared to the DAO voting?

I am a big fan of 'DAOs' within crypto and currently am a fan of both DASH's and PIVX's systems and communities.

Introducing DCRStake.com

DcRStake.com is a collaborative platform where people share voting authority as well as ticket reward on a per-second basis

**Decred staking problem**
Decred staking has two major problems:
- Very high ticket price which prevents most people from participating in POS as well as voting in agendas
- Ticket lock time where money can't be spent which is usually more than 28 days

**Solution**
An efficient ticket, vote, and reward sharing platform where users collaborate to participate in POS, help shape the future of Decred, and share tickets' rewards without the usual limitations of Decred POS.

**How does it work?**
Users deposit some Decred through the service website, that money are used to buy tickets and whenever a ticket votes, the reward is distributed among all participants who had balances during ticket life time, in the meanwhile when a user requests to withdraw all/some of his money, the withdrawal request is recorded in a ""pending"" state and gets processed once there are enough funds and he gets rewards based on the time span he participated for all tickets that were live during any point of time where he had balance at.

**How about votes?**
Agendas votes are handled using a similar approach where each user has a voting authority proportional to his balance and how much time he had this balance.",NA,"7wndf7",NA,0,NA,"false",1520515305,"false","self","t5_30fo6","false","serene5","","false","true",NA,"/r/decred/comments/7wndf7/dcrstakecom_next_generation_decred_staking/",NA,"",NA,"PoS","",0,0

My name is Rinke Hendriksen, 23 years, and active in the cryptocurrency space since 2013. First, I was mainly interested in Bitcoin and have been following the news passively. Since July last year, I am pursuing a degree in Digital Currencies at the [University of Nicosia](https://www.digitalcurrency.unic.ac.cy). Besides this, I became active as an event organizer for [BlockchainTalks](https://blockchaintalks.io) in Amsterdam and since recently I am following the Certified Online Ethereum Course from [B9 Labs](https://academy.b9lab.com/courses/course-v1:B9lab+ETH-22+2018-03/about). I am currently residing in Belgium, where I live together with my wife. I have a broad interest in the development of cryptocurrencies and other Blockchain projects, so Decred obviously caught my attention as well. 
I have been in touch with Haon in person and we talked among other things about possibilities of me representing Decred. We talked about the upcoming [Blockstack event](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/blockstack-berlin-a-signature-fund-event-tickets-39425916979?aff=blog110671) in Berlin. Keynote speakers are [Edward Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden), [Nick Szabo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Szabo),[ Elizabeth Stark](https://lightning.engineering/index.html#home) and many more. The event will be focused on [Blockstack](https://blockstack.org/), which, in my opinion would be a perfect complement to Decred. Haon and I concluded that it would be a good idea if Decred will be represented there by me. Therefore, my proposal:

**Proposal**

I would like to visit the [Blockstack Conference](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/blockstack-berlin-a-signature-fund-event-tickets-39425916979?aff=blog110671) as a regular attendant on the 2nd of March. Here, I will represent Decred in the best way possible, through engaging with the other audience members, handing out marketing material (if possible!) and showing my presence via diverse social media channels. My presence will be like guerrilla marketing in the sense that Decred will not officially be hiring a stand, but will unofficially be present through me.

To make this happen, I ask the Decred community to support Haon in his decision about sending me to Berlin in the name of Decred. If your approval is given, Haon will be in touch with the DHG to arrange funding. The following will be needed to make it a success: 

1) A Decred t-shirt + hoodie

2) Marketing material (flyers/stickers)

3) Enough Decred to cover my travel (€60 for return flight), stay (€50 for two nights), Early Bird ticket (€541,02).

If there are questions, comments, tips or doubts: please comment below. I will be keeping a close eye to this post in the upcoming days, to ensure that I will have your full confidence.

Have a great day,

Rinke Hendriksen

Has the Decred team taken the relatively simple step of publishing contractor payments from the development fund, even if anonymised?

In an ideal world we would have a full list of contractors and payments made (how much and when) along with hours contributed, hours worked etc. For now, a simplified and anonymised format will be a good start.

In the case of a contracting firm, it would be suffiicient to know how much the firm was paid and how many people from the firm contributed to work for each payment made). 

I know we are running a bit behind issuing public accounts (I believe the original deadline was Dec 2017) so a simple step like this would go a long way towards being transparent.

I invite views from contractors as to whether they would support this disclosure and if not, suggest alternative steps to increase transparency.",NA,"80mt09",NA,0,NA,"false",1520603616,"false","self","t5_30fo6","false","serene2","","false","true",NA,"/r/decred/comments/80mt09/transparency_payments_to_contractors/",NA,"",NA,"Question","",0,0

[https://beanstalkwebsolutions.com/reports/Decred%20Report%20December%20-%20January%202018%20REDACTED-483547a856d95218adhg536978532.pdf](https://beanstalkwebsolutions.com/reports/Decred%20Report%20December%20-%20January%202018%20REDACTED-483547a856d95218adhg536978532.pdf)

If you would like to see the non-redacted version, send me a private message here or on the Decred Slack (same username). We will need to verify you are an active community member before sending it.

We are getting really good results with Twitter, but we will most likely cut back on (or turn off completely) the LinkedIn campaign. 

Sadly, yesterday Facebook announced that they will be banning all cryptocurrency-related ads. One of our campaigns has already been shut down. We will investigate whether or not there is a type of Decred-related ad that they will allow.

Until next month,

Why are we lagging behind? Is there anything we can do to improve that?

I am trying to stake for the first time today, and since I do not have enough to purchase on my own I joined a staking pool https://dcr.stakepool.net using Decredition. Here are the steps I have followed: 




 
&gt;*Open Decredition and let it sync fully  
&gt;Sign up for an account at dcr.stakepool.net  
&gt;Enter the API given to me on in the Decredition ""Purchase Tickets"" tab  
&gt;Enter in my private passphrase (32 word phrase)


 
At this point, I get an error message on Decredition `""invalid passphrase for master private key""`, although I am sure that the private passphrase is correct. Going back to dcr.stakepool.net confirms that my public key address has been accepted. I can't follow the steps and input my redeem script in the next page. &amp;nbsp;  



I have already emailed support to ask for assistance, but I was hoping the community can guide me in the right direction, to see if I am missing some simple step?

My Win 10 Decre wallet which had been working fine for months now will not open.   Task Manager will show ""Cross-platform decred gui based on Electron and React""  process (sometimes multiple), but shows it taking up ram but never any cpu, disk, network resources.

My only thought is that i updated my mobo's bios last week but doesn't seem like it should affect anything.  Hasn't affected my other wallets.  Wallet app still seems to be in the right place, a shortcut exists in the Windows startup directory too.

So I download 1.1.3 and tried to install it.  ""DCRwallet closed due to error.  Check dcrwallet logs and contact support if this issue persists.""  No logs found.

I only had 2 dcr in this wallet but for the life of me i cannot find it.  Not even the wallet.db.  Found my seed, gonna uninstall all instances of Decred, start w/ 1.1.3 (download the whole f**kin' blockchain again!) and try again.  Hopefully this is straightforward. 
 I'll keep ya posted.

**Update 1.**  Uninstalling the wallet and reinstalling did not work. Same ""DCRwallet closed due to error."" message as before.

**Update 2.**  I've double and triple checked my folder permissions to no avail.  Latest is the following error at launch (this is after ensuring no decred processes were running in task manager beforehand).  [this Javascript Error](https://imgur.com/a/JPl7j)

My name is Benjamin Dunphy, co-organizer for Frontier Conf 2018 (https://www.FrontierSF.com). Frontier is a 2-day, single-track educational conference for engineers, curated for linear, progressive education. We have confirmed a number of industry leaders including Andreas M. Antonopoulos, Preethi Kasireddy, Noah Ruderman, Benedikt Bunz, Tara Vancil, Paul Frazee, Haseeb Qureshi, Max Fang, Dan Finlay, and Ryan Shea, among others.

We are seeking someone to speak about governance. On-chain governance is a crucial component to a more robust blockchain ecosystem, and Decred is definitely doing some incredible innovation around that. We think it's really important to remind people of the governance issue, maybe you could talk about the current issues with governance and forking, and how Decred is trying to solve that. 

We'd love to have Dave or another lead engineer speak on this important topic at the conference. The conference takes place in San Francisco on April 11 - 12. 

You can reach me at ben@FrontierSF.com to learn more.

&gt; Looks like a centralized wallet service that takes custody of users funds. I would avoid. Saw it posted this morning and poked around a bit. There are ""issues"".

&gt; So every account gets the same Decred receive address.

&gt; There's something in the ""security"" section that makes it look like it will let you back up your seed phrase but it obviously doesn't work.

&gt; And they're misrepresenting themselves as an ""official"" Decred wallet.

As mentioned in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/7zdglb/proposal_visiting_the_blockstack_conference_in/) I visited yesterday the Blockstack conference in Berlin. I believe it was a great success!

At the conference, I wore a Decred shirt and Hoodie and many people came to me; either because they knew Decred and were happy to see my hoodie, or because they wanted to know what Decred was. The conference featured Nick Szabo, who was talking about Blockchain governance and minimizing the argument surface in Blockchain protocols. Afterwards, I spoke briefly with him, thanked him for the talk and mentioned that Decred is actually minimizing the argument surface through its protocol. 

I initially wanted to take pictures with everybody I spoke with about Decred, in order to make a proof for the effectiveness of my attendance but didn't do this in the end, because many people refused for obvious privacy reasons.

A recap is available on [Steem](https://steemit.com/blockstack/@eknirhendriksen/yesterday-i-experienced-the-future-at-the-blockstack-conference-in-berlin) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/yesterday-i-experienced-future-blockstack-conference-rinke-hendriksen/?published=t).

https://www.coindesk.com/making-sense-crypto-asset-valuation-insanity/

the velocity issue I think for Decred is addressed by the staking mechanism as it means a lot of Decred is locked up and held , but some other issues could be addressed if it is believed they are important for Decred's future.

the cost of confirmation ? how is this addressed for Decred holders and spenders ? to be sure of your transaction is it required to trust other nodes ?

as pointed out in the article , 99% of crypto's are unlikely to become stores of value , but I would like to think that Decred will be one of the 1% that does.

This thread was created to discuss the uncertainties and shortcomings of Decred, as well as concerns that some may have with regards to the project. 

Be as respectful and nice as possible. This discussion has potential to be more emotionally charged as it may bring up issues that are upsetting. Many people are not only financially but also emotionally invested in the ideas and tools of the project.

**How it works:**

Post your concerns about Decred in reply to this thread.

Upvote the comments that contain the most valid criticisms, or the ones that have few or no real honest solutions/answers to them. 

As a community, as developers, we need to know about them. Even if they make us feel bad, we will have the opportunity to solve them in the future.

The comments that mention the biggest shortcomings of Decred should have the most upvotes. If you want to add further details, reply to that comment. Let's keep the thread structured and clear.

In order to keep things calm and organized, I thought it would be a good idea to gather all the skepticism in one thread. This idea was already implemented by the Monero community with great success. This is their first edition:

The move to decentralization is a true contrarian movement. As Peter Thiel says, cryptocurrency is a charismatic technology because it is contrarian -- cryptocurrency enthusiasts envision the world very differently, and ultimately a world that is more private, honest, and secure. Imo, the next major ""Google"", ""Facebook"" or ""Amazon"" in this next revolution is not going to be Coinbase or any other U.S.-based company. I would bet on companies like Binance. Changpeng is a true, ruthless cryptocurrency genius with incredible business acumen. As part of the Decred community, I'd like to urge us to try to look outside the U.S. to build community and work to align with crypto-friendly geographies such as Malta and crypto companies in those geographies so that we can become closer and closer to aligned with how the world will look 10 years from now. I know that, generally, the DCR community does not prioritize getting listed on new exchanges (we like being heads down on the code), but in the rare case on Binance, it is important to be listed for international exposure and awareness.

I'd like to invite you guys to be a part of the Datnoid Community. Please give the site a look and if you think there is value, enter some information for everyone to learn more about Decred. Ie; reasons to buy decred, who is using decred etc.

I did see the stickied thread and even the thread before this one with a summary, but didn't want to claim credit for the content nor do I feel qualified enough to be posting information. I would, however, like to learn from those who are more knowledgeable.

In times of FUD and panic, we need to continue to push for mass adoption. That is why I am currently developing an all in one tool for crypto lovers and could use your help!

&amp;nbsp;

[Coin Market Street's](https://www.coinmarketstreet.com) mission is to be the all in one tool for cryptocurrency lovers, built by cryptocurrency lovers. The goal is to be a one stop website for everything cryptocurrency. We provide the ability of viewing live cryptocurrency prices, breaking news, arbitrage opportunities, and crypto shopping.

&amp;nbsp;

**For Crypto Traders** (coming soon!)
Look at live prices and arbitrage opportunities for over 1500 coins across exchanges.

&amp;nbsp;

**For Crypto Businesses and Shoppers** (coming soon!)
This is an upcoming feature I'm very excited about. The ability to buy and sell anything you want using only cryptocurrencies. No fiat allowed!

&amp;nbsp;

**For Crypto Redditors**
All cryptos are linked to their official subreddit's. When you click on a crypto, you can view live pricing as well as all of the top reddit posts for that crypto.

&amp;nbsp;

For Crypto Developers
The github for the website is completely opensource and available on https://github.com/apuente93/cgd

&amp;nbsp;

I know, right now the site is very similar to [CoinMarketCap](https://www.coinmarketcap.com) and [LiveCoinWatch](https://www.livecoinwatch.com). The difference is that this site will be opensource, anyone can contribute and help build it. We are also not looking to make any money, so we will never have ads, and all donations will go to continued building and perfecting of the site.
We are here for all crypto lovers. If there are any other suggestions for the website, please speak up! You can use any of the social media outlets below to do so.

Where does CMC take their numbers from? They are stating that Circulating supply is 6,962,884 DCR.

The reason for us to start accepting DCR is the fact that all of us three founders are cryptomaniacs and we truly believe in its usability and in it long term. It is too sad to see that holders of DCR cannot actually spend their coins on too many e-commerces but are forced to buy their goods with fiat. We want to be one of the first ones to change this!

We believe that we are the first food company in Sweden that accepts cryptocurrency as a payment method and we would love to see other companies following us.

It's low finite 21M coin supply intends that decred could be a storage of value, but it's addition to the Lightning Network in the near future implies it could just be for everyday spends considering the main storage of value on the LN is obviously Bitcoin.

And I spent all the money I could spend, to get enough decreds for ticket. Someone may say, that buying ath is not wise, but it was not dcr/btc ath. Actually it was only around 0.0085 and seemed to break tough resistance at that moment, so I decided to buy. Well, breakout turned out to be fake, and decred continues its falling now. I suppose, it may slowly heading to 0.003 btc now where it bounces. 

   So what do I have now. I already lost around 5500$/0.4 btc. And that would be okay, cause it's crypto. And I'm still 100% sure, that decred will be at least top 3 coin one day. But lately I realised, that I could just buy asic for that money, or 8 of them if talking about obelisk and obtain my 90 decreds back in 1-2 months and get insane profits for a long time after. And also this explains, why that breakout was fake one. Just don't know what to do now, this thought stuck in my head and causes depression. Looks like I should have done better research few months ago.

Lightning fees should roughly work out to the cost of running and creating channels. This includes the on chain transactions of channel creation as well as the oppurtunity cost for keeping funds in the lightning network over time.

 For end users just keeping enough funds for micro transactions or businesses facilitating transactions this may work out, but for many others the oppurtunity cost would be missing out on staking rewards and politaie participation unless lightning fees rise to account for this difference. 

As more decred are issued and the pos reward drops I imagine this will become less of an issue. Also the funds on the lightning network can be released at any time.

**TL:DR Halong Miner and the (Batch 1) Obelisk miner will be profitable about at the same time (end of august), even tho the Halong Miner costs a lot more than the Obelisk miner, they will have reached ROI (assuming DCR price remains at current price level) just before Obelisk Miners Batch 2 are shipped. This also assumes that Bitmain does not jump in during these time periods with their DCR miners.**  
  
  
I've never been good at formatting here on reddit so the text might be a bit chaos to read. I could never be a teacher so hopefully someone here understands my logic.  
  
  
So i saw a lot of negativity on the Halong miners and how people assume that there will be no ROI when buying them. While i hate the term ""ROI"", it seems that people want to keep using it. We can't possibly know the price of DCR in future, if DCR goes to 0$ it doesn't matter if you bought DCR coins or just invested the money into buying a miner. I myself am a miner and wanted therefor to add to this discussion and calm people a bit (especially those who bought the Obelisk miner).  
  
  
We have not yet seen any numbers on how many miners Halong Mining are shipping. So in this calculation i'll be estimating that number to 2000 miners and they will be shipped in 2-3 weeks.  
  
  
On the other hand, we do know how many Obelisk miners will be shipped in batch 1 and when (30.6.2018), and the numbers shipped are: 2963 Miners.  
  
  
I've tried to check the difficulty chart and compare it to the hashrate chart and i came up with the ""magic"" number of ~67million difficulty per 1PH/s of hashrate. So in this calculation i'm also assuming that this number continues, **data for these numbers can be found in the end of the post.**  
  
  
**At the current time of writing this post (07.03.2018), the hashrate and difficulty is as following:**  
  
  
Hashrate: 1,5Ph/s  
  
  
Difficulty: 98,6 Million  
  
  
Math: Difficulty / Hashrate = 65,7 Million difficulty per 1Ph/s hashrate  
  
  
As i stated above, i've estimated that Halong Mining will ship 2000 miners, so the following numbers are calculated on that assumption.  
  
  
**So once the Halong Miners are introduced to the network this means that the hashrate and difficulty will increase by:**   
  
  
2000 Halong Miners * 2,1TH/s = 4,2Ph/s  
  
  
Meaning that the hashrate will increase by 4,2Ph/s once all of these miners are introduced to the network. This also means that the difficulty (**by using 67Million difficulty per 1Ph/s numbers**) will increase by 4,2Ph/s * 67Million = 281,4Million increase in difficulty.  
  
  
This (281,4Million) added to the current difficulty of: 98,6Million, we receive a total of 380Million Difficulty.  
  
  
Assuming these numbers are correct, you can expect the following income from a Halong Miner (Until Obelisk miners are shipped).  
  
  
https://whattomine.com/coins/152-dcr-blake-14r?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;hr=21000000.0&amp;d_enabled=true&amp;d=3800000000.0&amp;p=900.0&amp;fee=0.0&amp;cost=0.12&amp;hcost=10450&amp;commit=Calculate  
  
  
It says there that the estimated coins (per day) you'll be receiving when all Halong Decred Miners are introduced to the network, is 1,4DCR / day.  
  
  
But we also have to take into account that the obelisk miners will be shipped the last days of June. Meaning those who bought the Halong miners, have ~70-80 days of mining (+ still the shipping time for obelisk miners) before the obelisk miners actually are up and running.  
  
  
**Obelisk Miners Batch 1:  **
  
  
2963 Miners  
Hashrate per miner: 1,5Th/s  
Total hashrate introduced: 2963 Miners * 1,5Th/s per miner = 4,444Ph/s  
Difficulty increase: 297Million  
  
  
**Soooo... with those numbers we just add them to the previous profitability calculator:**  
Halong Miner, I also took the liberty of removing 70 days of mining 1,4 DCR per day from the hardware costs. Which leaves us with ~3600$ left.
    
  
https://whattomine.com/coins/152-dcr-blake-14r?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;hr=21000000.0&amp;d_enabled=true&amp;d=6770000000.0&amp;p=900.0&amp;fee=0.0&amp;cost=0.12&amp;hcost=3600.0&amp;commit=Calculate  
  
  
Obelisk Miner Batch 1:  
  
  
https://whattomine.com/coins/152-dcr-blake-14r?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;hr=15000000.0&amp;d_enabled=true&amp;d=6770000000.0&amp;p=500.0&amp;fee=0.0&amp;cost=0.12&amp;hcost=2500&amp;commit=Calculate  
  
  
A lot of assumptions in this post. There will always be a plus/minus situation with difficulty and income, due to luck and what not. But the general idea works.  
  
  
**Open question i have is:**  
  
1) How are Halong Mining testing their equipment, wouldn't we be seeing an increase in hashrate while they are testing the equipment, if now assuming they are shipping ~2000 miners, when total hashrate of these miners are way higher than now showing on the total network hashrate?  
  
  
**Data for the difficulty numbers are:**  
  
  
  
**Date: 07.02.2018 time ~23.00**  
  
Hashrate 1,41Ph/s  
  
Difficulty: 92,6Million  
  
Math: Difficulty / Hashrate = 65,6 Million difficulty per 1Ph/s hashrate  
  
  
  
**Date: 15.02.2018 time ~09.00**  
  
Hashrate: 1,572Ph/s

I googled this ""problem"", and see this

So I don't need private passphrase to access my funds or steal someones, and seed is enough for that? What's even the point in passphase then, if it is completely useless? Is everything how it is supposed to be or maybe devs should fix this immediately?
Also very good question in that topic with no normal answer:

&gt;What's stopping someone from guessing a 33 word seed and creating an existing wallet or of thin air?
With an increasing number of wallets, wouldn't the chance of this happening increase?","","866jo0",NA,0,NA,"false",1522337273,"false","self","t5_30fo6","false","serene2","","false","true",NA,"/r/decred/comments/866jo0/decred_security/","","",NA,"Question","",0,0

I never staked bcs I am not that pc-savy and I heard all these stories about people losing their coins bcs they didn't do it correctly . So I just kept my DCR in my exodus wallet since there was no manual for real pc - dummies like myself ( or I didn't find it ). But if I want to learn more about crypto I will have to try it out right!? So I figured that there might be step by step instructions for staking by now..? So my first question is: are there instuctions ( with pictures if possible ) for dummies like myself? My second question is in regard to exodus. It is really an awful place to keep my coins at. I missed literally every trading opportunity during the last bull run bcs Decred's status on Exodus is almost always "" temporarily unavailable"". So I had to hold the coin throughout the correction. The other 50% of my portfolio is on Binance. So.... when binance?? Why isn't it on Binance yet??? Binance???  I would prefer not having to make a Bittrex account for 1 crypto. In short :What is the best place to keep my coin at when doing trades instead of staking and might there be Binance listing in the future??

I also wrote a tool which uses the blocks on the mainnet blockchain to produce the actual values for comparison.  I thought it might be interesting to share the results here as well.

**The following results are the expected values based on a perfect distribution and the actual percentage found from analyzing the mainnet blockchain for 231681 blocks**

Elapsed | Expected | Actual
---------|----------|----------
10 sec | 3.28% | 2.30%
30 sec | 9.52% | 8.46%
1 min | 18.13% | 17.81%
2 min | 32.97% | 33.42%
3 min | 45.12% | 45.54%
4 min | 55.07% | 55.58%
5 min | 63.21% | 63.74%
6 min | 69.88% | 70.38%
7 min | 75.34% | 75.74%
10 min | 86.47% | 86.72%
20 min | 98.17% | 98.09%
30 min | 99.75% | 99.70%

In other words, assuming the network is following the expected distribution, ~18.13% of the blocks should be found within 1 minute, ~63.21% should be found within 5 minutes, and ~86.47% should be found within 10 minutes.

As we can see, it turns out that the actual distribution is quite close to the expected perfect distribution, which shows the network is operating in a really healthy fashion.  It is also interesting to note that the 0 to 10 and 0 to 30 second intervals slightly under perform the ideal values, which is completely expected because miners must wait for the votes to arrive before they can start building a new block, and this fact slightly skews the number of blocks found within the time spans downwards.","false","8dszhf",NA,0,NA,"false",1529620851,"false","self","t5_30fo6","false","serene7",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/decred/comments/8dszhf/expected_versus_actual_block_production_times/","t3_8dszhf",NA,NA,"Educational","",0,0

Why do I like Decred and Monero so much when they both take completely different positions on ASIC's? If you don't already know, Decred has been a staunch supporter of ASIC's and has encouraged them to be a part of their ecosystem. Monero takes the exact opposite direction to ASIC's, they even recently changed the mining algorithm of cryptonote slightly to screw up Bitmain's ASIC miners. As a result, it's now three times more profitable for regular GPU miners to mine Monero.

So, with that context in mind. It's hard to believe that both coins are consistent in perusing the goal of decentralization of network power (ie democracy).

On a side note, I truly believe that decentralization/distribution of powers is the most ideal format for any system, whether it be government or blockchains. Concentrated power can work for a time, but it inevitably burns out the system it captures with corruption and inefficiency. See the former Soviet Union for details on that. 

The wide democratic distribution of powers between legislature, courts, presidency, law enforcement, army and so on has worked for a very long time. Even though it's chaotic. Even though it's hard to reach a decision/consensus on an issue. Democracies are temperamental and slow. But they are stable, and fewer people perish as a result compared to other utopian idealistic systems with centralized power.

The same thesis can be applied to cryptocurrencies. The wider the distribution of powers, between miners (proof of stakers, proof of workers), users, full nodes, light nodes, developers and exchanges, the more likely the system will survive, prosper and not go down into the flames of utopian hubris. 

So, our thesis here is, we highly value decentralization/wide distribution of powers. How does this work when applied to Monero and Decred. And why are they both being consistent with there recent moves, even though they have opposite positions on ASICs?

For Monero's distribution of powers they have: proof of work miners; a very strong but community funded developer team who uses hardforks to push forward development; exchanges; full node operators; and users. The Monero community by and large loves the developers (high 90th percentile I'd say). 

However, it now appears that many Monero ASIC's were created in secret by BITMAIN months ago and were mining Monero on the down low. This was a threat to the current hegemony of the Monero developers in the distribution of powers. So, they cut them out of the picture by changing the mining algorithm. Now this arguably does protect the Monero network from a 51% attack, and miner hegemonic power. But it also helps to rescue Monero developer hegemonic power in the system. 

As a result, the ASIC Monero miners have gone their own way and are soon to play in their own centralized playground with MonerV and Moner0. Echoes of the Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold forks.

So, history is repeating itself, because proof of work systems haven’t figured out how to fairly distribute powers between stakeholders, especially miners and developers.

Except for Decred. Decred thinks it's figured out a solution to the struggle for power between developers and ASIC miners. They've hardcoded users as a third ""stake"" (haha) holder to distribute mining validation power to users. How? 

They have a combined proof of work and proof of stake mining mechanism to validate their blocks. So, users/hodlers of Decred can participate in validating the blocks that are first created by proof of work miners. They even get rewarded for doing so. So, I as a user, can currently purchase around 80 Decred (about 4000USD), lock those funds into a proof of stake contract for about 30 days (can't spend them), and I validate a proof of work block created by a regular asic miner by doing so. For my work, I get about 1 Decred as a reward (or 50 USD). Furthermore, with my stake, I can also vote on certain proposed development proposition for network upgrades. 

Note: The cost of a proof of stake ticket on Decred is relatively high (4000 USD). This is a definite barrier of entry for small time users who can`t afford that much. In fact, it may be cheaper to proof of work mine at those prices. In any case, there is work being done to help small time users to combine their funds together to afford a proof of stake ticket. 

Therefore, it appears that Decred developers do not fear ASICs, since a third party (the users/proof of stakers) acts as a buffer for power struggle.  **Functionally, by including proof of stake with proof of work distribution of power is bridged between the two poles of developers and ASIC miners through hodlers.** Visuals help drive the point home: https://ibb.co/fbwsEx

So, with that said, there is an argument to be made that it would be positive for Monero to include a combined proof of stake and work mining mechanism. Some of these benefits could include:

1.	Monero wouldn't have to change the mining algorithm any more

2.	Monero could embrace ASICs, thereby coopting the MoneroV and Moner0 communities and reducing them to dust


3.	MoneroV and Moner0 community members would be incentivized to switch to Monero to stake their coins and earn more

4.	Monero would have a fairer distribution of powers between developers, users and miners.

 
5.	Power struggles could be mediated on the blockchain through the proof of stake voting mechanism 

One additional note, Monero could be threatened by MoneroV or Moner0 if they are first to some how ever get the know how to implement a proof of stake/work system. This would attract Monero hodlers to these forks for staking rewards. 

I will conclude by saying, my gut instinct says that Monero could solve not just the ASIC, but Moner0 and MoneroV problem by implementing a combined proof of stake/work mining mechanism, as seen in Decred.  

There may be more benefits. But basically, I would love a combined Monero/Decred, for fungibility and long-term decentralization. 

Disclaimer: I hold and mine both Monero (64%) and Decred (6%)

What if we had an onchain vote every 12 months that create a checkpoint with a hash of all unspent transaction outputs (and other PoS state, such as tickets) so that the community in a decentralized effort agreed on the state at an earlier block height N (about a month earlier than when the vote starts)? That way no nodes need to download blocks older than block N, they would only need to download the snapshot at block height N from other nodes.

It'd require a lot dev work and it's not needed today but IMO it's an interesting thought. What do you think?

Hi!

There are a ton of great websites that provide a number of analytical data and info on cryptocurrencies. These are great, but it's easy to feel overwhelmed and confused while getting started in the space.

This is why my cousin and I launched https://coin-deck.com It's a mobile friendly, easy to navigate crypto index with a playing cards format. It focuses on discovering and tracking cryptocurrencies through the use of filters and sort options.

Currently, the websites lets you search cryptocurrencies based on market cap, price, age, industry, ratings and types. You can then filter the results through various options such as 24h gains, 24 volume or ATH traceback.

You can also add coins to your watchlist and add the ones you hold to your portfolio ""deck"" to track your earnings.

More features and filters will be added as we go along.

We'd love to hear your feedback!

#dcrd

This release of dcrd contains significant performance enhancements, infrastructure improvements, improved access to chain-related information for providing better SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) support, and other quality assurance changes.

A significant amount of infrastructure work has also been done this release cycle towards being able to support several planned scalability optimizations.

##Downgrade Warning

The database format in v1.2.0 is not compatible with previous versions of the software. This only affects downgrades as users upgrading from previous versions will see a one time database migration.

Once this migration has been completed, it will no longer be possible to downgrade to a previous version of the software without having to delete the database and redownload the chain.

##Notable Changes

**Significantly Faster Startup**

The startup time has been improved by roughly 17x on slower hard disk drives (HDDs) and 8x on solid state drives (SSDs).

In order to achieve these speedups, there is a one time database migration, as previously mentioned, that will likely take a while to complete (typically around 5 to 6 minutes on HDDs and 2 to 3 minutes on SSDs).

**Support For DNS Seed Filtering**

In order to better support the forthcoming SPV wallets, support for finding other peers based upon their enabled services has been added. This is useful for both SPV wallets and full nodes since SPV wallets will require access to full nodes in order to retrieve the necessary proofs and full nodes are generally not interested in making outgoing connections to SPV wallets.

**Committed Filters**

With the intention of supporting light clients, such as SPV wallets, in a privacy-preserving way while still minimizing the amount of data that needs to be downloaded, this release adds support for committed filters. A committed filter is a combination of a probabilistic data structure that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set with a predetermined collision probability along with a commitment by consensus-validating full nodes to that data.

A committed filter is created for every block which allows light clients to download the filters and match against them locally rather than uploading personal data to other nodes.

A new service flag is also provided to allow clients to discover nodes that provide access to filters.

There is a one time database update to build and store the filters for all existing historical blocks which will likely take a while to complete (typically around 2 to 3 minutes on HDDs and 1 to 1.5 minutes on SSDs).

**Updated Atomic Swap Contracts**

The standard checks for atomic swap contracts have been updated to ensure the contracts enforce the secret size for safer support between chains with disparate script rules.

###RPC Server Changes

**New getchaintips RPC**

A new RPC named getchaintips has been added which allows callers to query information about the status of known side chains and their branch lengths. It currently only provides support for side chains that have been seen while the current instance of the process is running. This will be further improved in future releases.

---

#dcrwallet

This release provides bug fixes for issues reported by users as well as new RPC features and additions which are required for Decrediton and Politeia. SPV work is ongoing but these changes will not land until a future release and after most of the network nodes are running with committed filter support.

This release contains a database upgrade and once upgraded it is not possible to downgrade to previous wallet releases without performing a seed restore with the old version.

##Bug fixes

* Orphan votes (votes which have become invalid for the new main chain tip block after a reorg or missed vote) are now rejected from reentering the wallet if still notified by dcrd.

* Watching only wallets are now usable again, after a breaking change to them introduced in the 1.1.2 release.

* The transaction fee when purchasing tickets with the purchaseticket JSON-RPC and WalletService.PurchaseTickets gRPC methods will now fallback to the wallet's configured fee rate if not specified by the RPC request.

* Various gRPC methods which allowed specifying 0 DCR as a target amount (e.g. WalletService.FundTransaction) now follow their documentation and will return or use as many unspent outputs as possible.

* Outputs of transactions with an expiry set are not spendable by consensus rules until having reached coinbase maturity. These outputs are no longer returned or used when selecting previous outputs to create new transactions.

##New features

* A new gRPC method WalletService.UnspentOutputs has been added to return a stream of all wallet unspent outputs. 
* Outputs may be filtered by their associated account and required confirmations, as well as stopping once a total target amount has been reached or exceeded.

* A new gRPC method WalletService.BestBlock has been added which will return the hash and height of the current main chain tip block. Previously, this information was only available as a unary RPC with the WalletService.Accounts method.

* The gRPC method WalletService.GetTickets will paginate results if called with a new target ticket count parameter.

* A new gRPC method WalletService.CommittedTickets has been added to find ticket purchase hashes specified by the request where the largest P2PKH commitment amount is controlled by the wallet. The commitment address is additionally returned by the result.

* A new gRPC method WalletService.SignMessages has been added to sign multiple messages at a time without needing to unlock and lock the wallet before and after each call.

* The gRPC BlockDetails and BlockInfoResponse messages now include a new field which specifies whether votes in the block disapprove of the parent block.

* A new JSON-RPC method publishunminedtransactions has been added which resends all unmined transactions of the wallet.

* A new JSON-RPC method sweepaccount has been added which can be used to move as much value as possible from an account to either (possibly the same) account or an address. This RPC can be used in place of the consolidate method but without knowing and specifying exactly how many inputs to use.

* The new JSON-RPC methods startautobuyer and stopautobuyer have been added which can start and stop the automatic ticket purchaser over JSON-RPC, similar to the already existing StartAutoBuyer and StopAutoBuyer gRPC methods of the TicketBuyerService.

* The JSON-RPC method getbalance now returns aggregate balances for all accounts if called with the special * account name.

##Other improvements

* The sendtosstx, sendtossgen, and sendtossrtx JSON-RPC methods have been removed. These RPCs were intended to manually send ticket purchases, votes, and revocations manually, but were unimplemented and would cause crashes if used.

* Transaction size estimation has been improved to more accurately estimate fees, in particular when redeeming with pay-to-script-hash redeem scripts.

* The help JSON-RPC method text for the getbalance RPC has been updated to reflect the changes made to the returned object.

* Users are now informed with log messages to configure their public passphrase or enter it on startup if the wallet is encrypted with one but it was not specified.

* Script execution errors during sanity checks after signing inputs now record additional information about the failure including the previous output and script being spent and the signature script used by the input.

#decrediton

This release of decrediton adds some major changes to the wallet startup, overview page and adds the first round of statistics for better user information. Now that the overall look and feel designed by Eeter has been implemented we will be focusing on refinement and adding improved responsiveness (e.g. dark mode, resolving to various media widths).

Launcher has been redesigned to provide the user with a more intuitive startup experience. In normal working mode, the daemon (of the chosen network) will begin to sync and become operational while the user completes wallet creation/selection. Then once both the wallet is ready and the daemon has synced the wallet will fully load.

A tutorial, release notes, settings and logs have all been added to the launcher for the user to utilize whilst they may be waiting for their daemon to sync. Hopefully this will allow the user to more seamlessly create wallets with less confusion or require any additional support.

The wallet creation by seed has received a substantial update as well. We now allow the user to copy seeds (if they complete a warning screen) and also paste seeds. And for confirmation for new wallets only requires the user to complete 1/3 of the words to confirm storage of wallet's seed.

Overview has been redesigned to give the user more information about their wallet's current situation and to guide them where to find various features of their wallet. Basic graphs covering balances, tickets and transactions have been added. All recent transactions and recent ticket activity can be found below the overview graphs. We will be adding more features to the overview page as we gauge user interest and feedback on existing additions.

Introductory data preparation and statistics have been implemented for this release. For now we are providing a small window of lookback for transactions, staking and other information. The reduced window size is mostly an issue with unsatisfactory performance. When this performance improves, we will be adding custom windows and window lengths for custom graphing and exporting options.


##New features

* Validate Addresses - a form to validate addresses has been added to the Security Center. This will allow users to test addresses to confirm address ownership and/or validity.

* Filter by address - now transactions can be filtered by address in History. When the user enters a string into the address filter form, it will show any address that has an output with a matching address.

* Charts - we have decided to use recharts as our first charting solution.

* Import wallet from hex seed - instead of entering in the 33 word mnemonic, they are now able to use the hex representation of their seed.

* Export data to CSV - we now all users to export various types of data to csv. These options are found under the Transactions page.

* Show logs - logs can now be found on the launcher and on the help page. For now, we only show the logs of the current instance of wallet and daemon. This is mostly due to performance with pulling in thousands of lines of text.

These security flaws almost entirely eliminate the benefits of the Proof of Stake side of Decred's consensus protocol, reducing its security to the level of Bitcoin - where the same amount of hashpower must be used for a given level of security as Bitcoin.

The most critical flaw are Decred's susceptibilities to the Orphan-based Mining Monopoly Attack and the Economic Mining Monopoly Attack. The Orphan-based version reduces the cost of dominating the chain to 50% of the hashpower (rather than also requiring substantial stake), and the Economic version reduces the cost of gaining x% of the hashpower to the cost of buying `x`% of the honest hashpower (rather than `x/(100%-x)`%)

In the Orphan-based Mining Monopoly Attack, an attacker gains more than 50% of the hashpower and monopolizes the generation of PoW blocks, pushing any other miner out of business. The attacker would gain more than 50% of the hashpower, then simply refuse to mine on top of any chain that contains new PoW blocks created by another miner and instead selfishly mine on the chain where the last PoW block was their's. Since the blocks would be valid blocks propagated normally through the network, any honest minter would mint blocks on top of the attacker's blocks, giving the attacker's chain just as much PoS as the honest chain. However, the attacker's chain would have more hashpower and therefore would be the longest chain. At that point, no other miner would be able to make money and would be forced to exit the network, giving the attacker 100% or almost 100% of the hashpower. The attacker could then use their near complete control of the hashpower to perform other attacks with very little coin ownership. This essentially means that Decred's security is not much higher than pure proof of work. Since Decred blocks can't be created without a miner, I don't see a way to fix this problem without fundamentally changing the Decred protocol.

The Economic Mining Monopoly Attack: Consider a mining environment where mining has near-break-even revenue (or exactly break-even considering opportunity cost) and where there are no altruistic honest miners willing to mine at a loss. In such a situation, any entering hashpower would correspond with an exit of a similar amount of hashpower (theoretically an identical amount of hashpower, given identical hashpower costs). What this means is that an attacker willing to mine 100% of the blocks at a slight loss can obtain 100% of the (active) hashpower.

The attacker with cost-effective hashpower could slowly obtain more and more hashpower while incurring very little loss, since any consistent loss is unsustainable for miners mining as a business and miners would stop mining until the remaining miners miners would again be profitable. The quicker the attacker gains this hashpower, the less loss they would incur. For bitcoin's 2-week difficulty periods, if the attacker obtains all the hashpower in that 2-week period, they would incur no loss at all during that time, and would only incur loss for the amount of time it takes the honest hashpower to stop mining bitcoin (probably to switch to a different cryptocurrency) once the difficulty adjusts.

Because this attack vector has nothing to do with manipulating the blockchain in programmatically detectable dishonest ways, there's no way to prevent anyone from executing this, other than by increasing the cost of obtaining enough hashpower such that operating that obtained hashpower exceeds the revenue earned by mining blocks. This means that any system where miners compete with each other only via hashpower and that relies on the attacker not achieving near-100% of the hashpower, is susceptible to this attack.

Even detecting this attack would be difficult as this would look like some miners simply found a more cost-effective way to mine. What you would see is that the honest miners who identify themselves in their blocks will stop mining. Once a lot of such miners exit the system, the only way to prevent the attack would be to add more block revenue (coinbase reward and fees).

Bitcoin is also susceptible to the Economic Mining Monopoly Attack, which means that an actor attacking Bitcoin at equilibrium (which Bitcoin is not at today) would only need to obtain an amount of hashpower equal to half the existing hashpower, rather than having to double the existing hashpower. Of course, Bitcoin is not at equilibrium, and it remains to be seen how long it will take for miner profit margins shrink to the point where the effects of this form of attack would be significant.

Similar hybrid consensus protocols like Proof of Activity, Memcoin2, Hcash, the 2-hop Blockchain, and TwinsCoin all have both of these problems. 

To summarize, while Decred has interesting characteristics that could allow stakers to more effectively respond to such attacks (by refusing to vote for an attacker's blocks, if they can detect which ones they are), the fact remains that these attacks substantially reduce the security of the system, and the Orphan-based attack is particular devastating to any security advantages Decred might otherwise have over pure proof-of-work.

I've done a lot of thinking about this in designing a somewhat similar protocol called [proof-of-time-ownership](https://github.com/fresheneesz/proofOfTimeOwnership), and I'm happy to answer any questions about these attack vectors.","false","89mvfd",NA,0,NA,"false",1529545708,"false","self","t5_30fo6","false","serene2",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/decred/comments/89mvfd/key_security_flaws_in_decred_limits_the_security/","t3_89mvfd",NA,NA,"Misleading Title","",0,0

I want to develop a tool to notify me when my tickets are voted. Ideally I want this to run in the cloud and not require me to keep my computer with my node running 24/7. My thought is that running a full node on something like AWS or google cloud would be a bit pricey, so my question is: are there any public nodes with available APIs? I see that insight has APIs, and of course there is the direct json-rpc or websockets api, and I'm happy to use any of those for this, but are there any public endpoints that I can use? I would likely only contribute a small amount of traffic. I found a list of nodes [here](https://dcrstats.com/map), and while I can verify that they are online, I assume they have security set to access the node (not looking to access the wallet API, just the node API to get info about the latest blocks).

I suppose another, much more complex option would be to try to modify dcrd to accept tx info but not store it? This is likely more complex than I have time to dive into on the occasional weekend when I'm motivated to work on stuff like this","false","8clo3t",NA,0,NA,"false",1529598990,"false","self","t5_30fo6","false","serene2",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/decred/comments/8clo3t/dumb_question_from_someone_who_wants_to_develop_a/","t3_8clo3t",NA,NA,"Development","",0,0

# Development

Wallet and node software version 1.2.0 has been released. Decrediton wallet highlights: improved startup experience, redesigned overview page, added basic graphs to visualize statistics and an export to CSV (helpful for tax reporting). dcrd node software highlights: significantly faster startup and compact filters to support light clients. See full release notes and downloads [here](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.2.0), for Decrediton use [1.2.1](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.2.1) bugfix release.

The release process has been improved. Instead of announcing a release date and trying to meet it, a Release Candidate 1 (RC1) will now be posted. After it has been tested an bugfixed with the help of the community, a second candidate (RC2) will be released. This is repeated until an RC version with no apparent bugs becomes the final release. The new process removes a ton of pressure from developers and users and gives more time for testing. As our primary consumer-facing product, Decrediton, is growing in features and complexity, more testing will be required for new releases.

Politeia is ""Getting close to a public beta of voting"" ([slack](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C0NRMDVMJ/p1523623105000168)). Decred plugin [merged](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/242), paywall and voting are in the testing stage. Ticket voting [works](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/984518284757221376) on testnet via CLI.

Trezor support got closer as Decred patch [was merged](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-mcu/pull/274). Please note this is only firmware support, to be usable it also needs wallet integration.

WooCommerce [Decred plugin](https://github.com/xifrat/decred-woocommerce-plugin) alpha version is ready for testing.

Decred.org received a new sleek [exchanges page](https://www.decred.org/exchanges/).

The [contributors](https://www.decred.org/contributors/) page has been updated to add 10 new faces. Some of them are new to the project but others have been contributing for a while.

Dev activity stats for April: 152 active PRs, 125 commits, 21,656 added and 10,288 deleted lines spread across 7 repositories done by 2-7 developers per repository. ([chart](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/991734153631563776))

# Network

Hashrate: April started at 2.0-2.7 PH/s range and seen a general increase with some big [fluctuations](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8doiuo/question_about_network_hashrate_and_mining/) between lows at 2.2 and new all time high above 5.2 PH/s.

Nodes: there are 200 public listening and 500 normal nodes per [dcred.eu](https://dcred.eu/nodeStats) as of May 1. 169 nodes already upgraded to version 1.2.0. Some 30 nodes were observed to be testing Release Candidate versions before the final release.

Ticket price 30-day average has seen a steady rise to 87.5 DCR. Stake participation is solid 46.1% with 3.53 million DCR as of May 1.

# ASICs

Updates from Obelisk's Taek:

&gt; We got results back. They are more or less on line with the simulations  
&gt; I didn't realize this, but we don't get the real chips back for 3 more weeks. The ones we've been testing are hacked together into a DIP package (they are BGA chips) that really screws up the results  
&gt; There's a decent chance that the full bga chips perform better  
&gt; For the time being though, we're pretty much on track for the hashrates estimated on the website ([slack](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3P6R055Z/p1523504966000203), Apr 12)

And regarding the June delivery date:

&gt; We're still on track for batch 1. We've ordered most of the parts we'll need, including the chips. We've got working chips, we've got test boards, test units, test everything. We've signed manufacturers to produce everything. Obelisk is going strong. ([reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/siacoin/comments/8edjy8/obelisk_batch_1_updates/dxuoayz/), Apr 23)

We are thankful for his updates in our #pow-mining channel and hope other ASIC manufacturers will also join.

Fellow Sia miners are [discussing](https://www.reddit.com/r/siacoin/comments/8eo1x5/first_look_at_obelisk_unit/) the design of Obelisk SC1 case.

Halong: B29 units are shipping. The amount of units in first batch was estimated 450-600 by our community member. Review of DragonMint B29 [published](https://bitsonline.com/dragonmint-b29-blake-256-decred-miner/), people are [discussing](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8a2vul/just_unboxed_my_dragonmint_b29s/) shipping and running the miners.

By surprise, Innosilicon [announced](https://twitter.com/Inno_Miner/status/986615352200118274) the sale of [D9 DecredMaster](http://www.innosilicon.com/html/d9-miner/index.html) ASIC miner with specs [identical](https://www.hashespersecond.com/2018/04/18/innosilicon-releases-blake2b-blake256-miners-that-mirror-halong-offerings/) to Halong B29 while being much cheaper ($6800 Inno vs $10499 Halong). Expected shipping date of the first batch is April 28-30. The company is active on their [bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3345156.0) thread, also see our [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8d7awu/innosilicon_releases_blake2b_blake256_miners_that/).

Just 9 days later Innosilicon [announced](https://twitter.com/Inno_Miner/status/990117591141134336) second batch with delivery on May 7-11 and same price of $6800. ([reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8fk2ao/decred_miners_back_in_stock_from_inno_and/))

# Integrations

Decred's Brazilian community made good progress with integrations this month.

&gt; emiliomann: On April 2nd @Rhama will launch the first BR exchange of altcoins with fiat market and totally within the laws of the Brazilian government. Decred will have the two markets DCR/BTC and DCR/BRL. It’s very difficult to fulfill all the legal requirements and get authorization to work with FIAT here.

The exchange [turned](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/984105841048436741) out to be Profitfy. Profity is innovating by using dcrtime for their blockchain ID login via [Original My](https://originalmy.com). Great to see this deeper engagement with the tools that Decred provides, and not a surprise that it comes from @Rhama, who has been a community member since day one.

This seems to have spurred another exchange, Braziliex, to bring forward their [launch](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/984478905061928960) of DCR/BRL and DCR/BTC pairs, coming just 2 hours after Profitfy launched.

Not stopping there,

&gt; emiliomann: Hey guys, this is a poll of the biggest Bitcoin exchange in Brazil that is planning to open altcoins markets. Please, help the Brazilian community by voting for Decred! Just one click. Thank you! https://twitter.com/mercadobitcoin/status/981602483268194307

Finally,

&gt; viniciusfrias: We're excited to announce PagueCripto.com, a Brazilian crypto-to-fiat payment gateway which accepts Decred among other cryptocurrencies for Brazilians to pay daily bills, such as credit cards, energy, rent, etc, and also to make local bank transfers. Our service is both a web platform and an Android app, and as our community is relevant in Brazil, we are offering a discount coupon (50%) in service fees using DCR until May 14, 2018. Check it out at [paguecripto.com](https://www.paguecripto.com/) and in Google Play Store. ([slack](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C0NRMDVMJ/p1525043419000038))

Moving to other countries, good news from Canada:

&gt; michae2xl: Decred is now available on [@ezBtcCanada](https://twitter.com/ezBtcCanada), an exchange with DCR/CAD trading pair. From Toronto — [ezbtc.ca](https://www.ezbtc.ca/)

i2Rav [announced](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C0NRMDVMJ/p1522975903000135) [i2trading.com](https://i2trading.com/), a new trading desk that will be offering DCR/EUR pair:

&gt; Eventually we hope to offer the pair in GBP and YEN as well

[changenow.io](https://changenow.io/), a non-custodian exchange for fast conversions, [added](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/981623403378454528) DCR.

You can see all exchanges known to support Decred in a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11Iy2-3oqk-RUT7Fz0CaBcNI289o4YyAXBew86uNCCxQ/edit) maintained by snr01. Many of them are missing from coinmarketcap.

# Adoption

[The Crypto Lawyers, LLP](https://thecryptolawyers.com/), a crypto exclusive U.S. law firm began accepting Decred ([reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8909x6/the_crypto_lawyers_a_crypto_exclusive_us_law_firm/)):

&gt; RAurelius: I think that a law firm accepting Decred is a worthy distinction from other previously publicized companies that accept Decred for typical consumer products. Legal services are severely lacking in the Crypto-sphere, so the publicity is good for everyone in this arena.

Great to see business owners reaching us directly in chat.

[VotoLegal](https://votolegal.com.br/) is [migrating](https://twitter.com/marco_peereboom/status/986699534888730624) from Ethereum to Decred blockchain:

&gt; emiliomann: VotoLegal, a Brazilian project that uses blockchain technology to allow election campaign funding to be transparent and that all transactions conducted are tracked and made available to the citizens, now uses dcrtime and Decred blockchain.  
&gt; https://twitter.com/decred_br/status/986610826051276800 ([slack](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C0NRMDVMJ/p1524065250000150))

# Partnerships

YBF Ventures and Decred announced partnership in building a blockchain-focused development and business hub in Australia.

&gt; With the YBF Ventures partnership, Decred hopes to grow their Australian contractor network and scale their operations throughout the Asia-Pacific region. ([btcmanager.com](https://btcmanager.com/ybf-ventures-partners-with-the-decred-project-to-build-a-decentralized-internet/))

&gt; We specifically chose Decred for a more robust corporate partnership, and it is the first time that a decentralised autonomous organisation is partnering with a ‘traditional’ organisation in such a capacity. ([ybfventures.com](http://ybfventures.com/ybf-decred-partnership-web-3/))

# Community Discussions

Reddit highlights: A [debate](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/89mvfd/key_security_flaws_in_decred_limits_the_security/) on Decred protocol security and attack cost, a [comparison](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8dszhf/expected_versus_actual_block_production_times/) of expected and actual block production times, a [write-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8aro9e/thought_experiment_combining_decred_and_monero_to/) on distribution of powers and how Monero could benefit from a PoS governance layer, [two](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8a0hh8/antiasic_forks_considered_harmful_by_philip_daian/) [other](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8axc02/is_the_war_against_asics_worth_fighting_by_derek/) threads on ASIC resistance, and one discussing different types of [decentralization](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/895ets/jimmy_song_bitcoin_is_king/).

Very thoughtful discussion on whether it is appropriate to use half naked photos in marketing, followed by meta-discussion how to handle very polarizing issues and unwanted contributions to the marketing efforts of a decentralized project. ([slack](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C5HPHMFQF/p1524182971000248), [continued](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3PAYQJTW/p1524304298000029))

A new [#governance](https://decred.slack.com/messages/CAAMEU56W/) channel was created to discuss governance in Decred and other projects.

[r/politeia](https://www.reddit.com/r/politeia/) subreddit was recovered for Decred community. Thanks to Tivra for filing the request. Politeia can bring a lot of value outside Decred so it well deserves its own sub.

A new Slack [invite page](https://slack.decred.org/) has been [setup](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/990282234471989248) and onboarded 40 people in 48 hours.

Decred StackExchange site [proposal](https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/115865/decred) was closed due to inactivity in a 7 day period, according to Area 51 [rules](https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/20966/minimum-activity-requirements-for-area-51).

# Markets

In April Decred showed a confident recovery after previous months. DCR/USD moved from below $40 to nearly $90 and the more liquid DCR/BTC from 0.0058 to 0.0093.

OOOBTC showed unexpectedly huge DCR trading [volume](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/ooobtc/) of $19 m on April 10 ([reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8b40bj/ooobtc_exchange_moving_over_8_million_in_volume/)), it went back to normal 2 weeks later.

On April 25 a wild rush took the price from 0.00777 to 0.0177 BTC in under 30 minutes on Poloniex, setting a new USD all time high of ~$165 ($141 world average). Prices on other exchanges followed to a lesser degree. Possible causes were discussed on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8eq566/uh_wtf_just_happened/). Talking about all time highs, an [indicator](https://alltimehigh.ly/) tracking difference between ATH and current price shows Decred is competitive at retaining USD value.

# Relevant External

Bittrex finally opened registrations again.

ASIC debates are raging after Bitmain stealth-launched ASICs for Sia, Monero and Ethereum. Most opinions reflect on whether and how to resist ASICs, but some are recognizing the Decred way, like [this](https://tokeneconomy.co/is-the-war-against-asics-worth-fighting-b12c6a714bed) excellent piece.

The importance of governance is gaining recognition as well. One notable example is [Mike Hearn's AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89z483/ama_ask_mike_anything/) where it was a hot topic.

In ours, expand our student researches about physics and space, developing new technologies, creating new kinds of sensors and others interfaces and in that, UFPel Rocket Team was created. A few challenges were surpassed in the middle time that came around and the group grown fast by interest of all students. Since DECRED started helping us, the odds changed for us, and things get a little easier and we were able to build ANITA.
	Now, we are facing a much bigger challenge. Spaceport America Cup is coming and we are going to compete with the best rocketeers around the world, and that is going to happen in june, between 19th and 23th.
	Since is not an easy task to be a rocketeer, our team is a big one. The crew is composed by aerodynamic, avionic, propulsion and design groups. A few members will be able to pay for the role trip and represent the team, but some of the key ones, will not. By a few, we can say only seven of fourty. In those other thirty three, there are more than one that are absolutely necessary to fix some of the problems that may arrive for us in the middle of the desert.
	Here in Brazil, DECRED was shown up for a bunch of people in different parts of the country. We have been present in Open Campus Party, were by recent researches, it was visited by more than a hundred thousand visitors. The brand also shown up in local newspapers, and we are going to bring your name in a new space, but now internacional.
	And, that's why we are here again, to ask for your help. Even that we already build our new rocket, COTADA, that we are going to launch in june, we need, like 30DCR, to be able to bring ours key members. That said, one is a Chemistry doc, that cooks our propellant and the other one is a recently degree Engineer, this two are the ones who will mean our success or failure if some problem arrives in the times that we already have left Brazil. This money will pay for all the costs of the trip of this two, for the flight tickets, transport, food and stuff. If you disponibilize more, we can bring other members that will help and the odds will be all in our favor.

It run through it's startup and got to 'Finalizing Setup' -- it says this can take a while so I left it running overnight but it didn't finish. 

OK, maybe it's because I'm upgrading so I removed the old config and installed from scratch, downloaded blockchain, etc -- same deal, stuck on 'Finalizing Setup' for hours. 

Then I noticed that 1.2.1 was out so I installed that but no change. Not only does it stick on ""Finalizing Setup"" but it's hammering the CPU. I leave it all day with a fan pointed at it so it's not throttling due to heat but it still doesn't help. 

Finally I tried installing it on a different, significantly more powerful, machine -- the rest of the start-up goes about twice as fast but the final symptoms are just the same. 

In all cases restarting the program just seemed to go back to the same state. 

The logs just show it constantly calling GetTransactions but no other data is shown so I can't tell if it's progressing. I tried diving into the code but I'm not familiar enough with the layout to work out where it is. 

So, is there possibly a bug somewhere? Or does the startup just take a very long time -- if it's going to take that long there needs to be some sort of progress bar (or at least a bit more info in the logs). 

If someone could give me some pointers as to which bits of code to look through I'm happy to go and see if I can find the bugs myself.

There seems to be a lot mis-incentives going on here, i.e there are not a lot of active engineers (golang) yet theres a ton of cash coming in. 

This stuff is hard and hiring on can't been seen as a seed round anymore - these teams need to be scaled and guys need to be trained.  

Not only that theres tons of competition for attracting talent considering all the other projects with tons of money.

I feel the community isn't doing whats appropriate to grow the engineers and developers.  How do you guys feel about this? 

**EDIT:** 
This wasn't ment to be hurtful to any one in anyway. Afraik I am just a lurker who has decred under his watch as well as some others and have begun paying attention to hiring as part of my ""portfolio watch"".

I may be ill informed of the differences of how a blockchain is ran compared to a traditional ""startup"". i.e may be comparing apples to oranges. I have just been paying attention to other projects such as say Haskel, Zcash, which are doing things to improve their development team ""momentum"" you could say. i.e I believe Haskel is actively sending developers to haskel camps.

Bitcoin has immense momentum due to bitcoin being 10 grand - i.e contributors were most likely part of what you could compare to a ""seed round"" and now have the fire and spirit to keep going (and also create alt coins). 

**Also all people burn out, c0 can't keep rolling on forever. I am talking about the reality of people, money, work, and retirement. This is a real risk to stake holders.**

Someone also said this should be looked liked similar to a government.  If that were the case then low out put people would be hired on board daily so that is definitely not the right analogy. 

This sparked a huge discussion and wasn't meant to point fingers at anyone. Seems it needs to be brought to the limelight.

* A small registration fee (&lt; $10) which must be paid in DCR to activate accounts. This will prevent rampant sybil-style manipulation by imposing a cost on the registration of multiple accounts.
* Censorship tokens that will allow any participant to demonstrate that their proposal or comment has been censored by admins.

This post is specifically about the up/down voting on comments on the Politeia web platform, it does not relate to the ticket voting which will be used to make binding decisions. 
I've brought this up a couple of times recently on the [#politeia and #governance channels](https://slack.decred.org/). This post is intended to give an account of how I see the issue following those discussions, and to prompt a broader discussion.

I'm coming at this from the following perspective: As the Pi community scales to hundreds or thousands of active participants, up/down voting on comments could be a useful indicator of whether the community agrees with a very specific criticism or suggestion on a proposal. If these votes can be trusted as coming from genuine community members, this weighting of suggestions would help proposal authors (and others) to understand how a proposal could be improved. More broadly, it would give insight into what kind of criteria the community use to decide if proposals should be approved.

I tend to see anything that can help people to understand how the Decred DAO ""thinks"" and predict how it will behave as a good thing. 

If there is value in up/down voting on Politeia comments, I think it makes sense to make these up/down votes transparent - i.e. publish data on which pseudonymous accounts have voted up/down on which comments. A table like [pseudonym, comment_id, vote, timestamp].

While up/down voting is anonymous, any suspicion that it's being manipulated can eat away at its credibility, because there is no way to see how voting scores that look suspicious occurred.

Reddit has proprietary anti-cheating code which nullifies some up/down votes. As this code is not open, Politeia cannot use the same approach. Any approach to nullifying manipulation of up/down voting would have to be developed for Politeia.

In Politeia's case, anonymous voting would also create a disparity between the administrators of the Politeia web platform and other stakeholders, because admins will have access to this voting data and could in principle selectively expose or censor voting which goes against their own views.

The **down-sides** are obvious. People may prefer to vote anonymously, to click those up/down buttons without worrying that they could be called out for voting ""badly"". 

In principle, this may also open the system up to bribery, people could be paid for their up/down votes. I see this as unlikely, because the votes don't have any decision-making power. 

A greater concern would be an environment where people accuse others of voting badly or to pursue some agenda or personal grudge.

I don't see these down-sides as being so bad, because:

* People who don't like the idea of their up/down votes being on display could use a pseudonym that isn't associated with other channels. Or, they could avoid up/down voting entirely, this wouldn't exclude them from participating in the binding ticket votes.
* Every significant way of participating in in Decred's governance is associated with a wallet address or a pseudonym on a social channel. If people want their voice to be heard they can't do it anonymously, they have to speak using a certain identity. Extending this to up/down votes on Pi makes sense to me. I would rather that people vote in the knowledge that others can see how they voted, because I think this would encourage people to give their votes more consideration.

 
I'm bringing this up now before the Politeia web platform launches, because we have an opportunity to decide that up/down voting should be transparently associated with users' handles and make this a condition from the beginning. It would be more problematic to make up/down voting transparent if a need arises later on, when people have already been using it on the understanding that it is anonymous.

One alternative that has been suggested is charging a small fee to make up/down votes. I'm not a fan of this because it amounts to paying for influence, ""micro-lobbying"". 

I think there are advantages in knowing how individual stakeholders feel about certain ideas or positions.  These go beyond making sure sock-puppet accounts or influence-maximising tactics aren't being used to distort the perception of support for comments.

Also, up/down voting is a fairly flexible tool (see the variety of ways it is used by different subreddits). If the up/down scores on Pi can be trusted, that opens up possibilities for using them in more interesting ways, experimenting with how other aspects of the project might be decentralized.","false","8ghwmi",NA,0,NA,"false",1529669495,"false","self","t5_30fo6","false","serene3",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/decred/comments/8ghwmi/the_case_for_and_against_transparent_updown/","t3_8ghwmi",NA,NA,"Discussion","",0,0

https://www.crypto51.app/

Interestingly enough all the proof of work coins are listed...but decred isn't.

I'm hoping a dev can verify that Decred's hybrid verification through POS and POW makes it much harder to double spend on our chain, compared to the regular old and tired PoW blockchains.

for a double spend to happen on Decred practically, a bad actor would need to have a majority of hashing power, AND buy a majority of the tickets available. And even then the odds are very much against that bad actor, as he needs to win essentially two coin tosses at the same time instead of just one.

I think this is a salient point that needs to be driven home, as double spend attacks are recently becoming more and more popular and worrisome in the ecosystem.

And that point is:

Decred has all the benefits of Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and the combination of both.

Something that I find conceptually strange in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, litecoin, and decred, is that every transaction is treated equally, no matter what its value. The basic reason for this makes sense -- it doesn't take up any more space on the blockchain to list a big transaction vs a tiny transaction -- but it results in issues where big expensive chains with the strongest security (bitcoin) become unusable for small transactions because of fees.

Naively, the security of the network is related to its market cap (for proof of work, this is related to the total cost of specialized mining equipment, etc.). 

So, putting these thoughts together, it makes sense that one would want to use a chain with a lower market cap for smaller transactions, since they can be done cheaper, and the security considerations are smaller. Conversely, if you want to send $100 million, you don't care about the fees, and you want maximum security. All of this is already playing out, with bitcoin used for large transactions and others (e.g. litecoin) being used for smaller ones.

This issue seems to be addressed/addressable using atomic swaps. One could use decred, litecoin, or other ""smaller cap"" currencies for small transactions, and atomic swap to bitcoin for long-term storage of larger amounts. However, currently such a system is rather ad hoc -- it relies on having atomic-swap-compatible chains with a nice sequence of market caps.

I wonder if it would make sense to directly launch a sequence of individual blockchains that are roughly the same and can easily interact with atomic swaps, but have slightly different consensus algorithms (e.g., the proof-of-work functions would be slightly incompatible) and decreasing block times. It might be possible to come up with an equilibrium where, e.g., there are three chains: Decred-main (5 min blocks), Decred-sub1 (1 min blocks), Decred-sub2 (30 sec blocks). Small cheap transactions could live on Decred-sub2, aggregated into bigger transactions + medium-term storage on Decred-sub1, and then ultimately settled on Decred-main.

Is this a reasonable approach to scaling?","false","8gmofg",NA,0,NA,"false",1529671807,"false","self","t5_30fo6","false","serene3",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/decred/comments/8gmofg/effective_scaling_of_the_level_of_security_and/","t3_8gmofg",NA,NA,"Discussion","",0,0

This proposal aims to outline the importance of Decred offering and hosting a cryptocurrency scholarship on scholarshipowl.com. The proposal will identify relevant background information, steps involved in posting a scholarship on scholarshipowl.com and benefits that come from partnership between scholarshipowl.com and Decred. 

**Background**

scholarshipowl.com is a platform that helps students find and apply for a wide range of scholarships in order to finance their education. The platform has over 3 million registered students who have been using the service successfully.

The main objective of scholarshipowl.com is to optimize scholarship application process, simplify it for the students and allow students to complete their scholarship applications more efficiently. Additionally, scholarshipowl.com strives to unveil the mystery involved in the scholarship application process. More precisely, scholarshipowl.com is working towards increasing transparency of the scholarship application process by providing a clear feedback to students' as to the stage of their scholarship application. 

As mentioned earlier, the primary goal of scholarshipowl.com is to offer students a wide variety of scholarships in order to help them fund their education. However, besides helping students find and apply for scholarships we care about expanding knowledge of our users. With regard to that, we believe that knowledge and understanding of blockchain technologies is the key. Given Decred's considerable influence and innovation in the cryptocurrency market and decentralization we believe it is essential for Decred to offer a cryptocurrency scholarship on scholarshipowl.com platform in order to educate students and help  scholarshipowl.com in their scholarship application transparency efforts.   

**Providing Cryptocurrency Scholarship on scholarshipowl.com
In order to host and provide a scholarship on scholarshipowl.com the following information is needed:**

* Scholarship provider mission

*A brief description of Decred company mission and undertaking.*

* Scholarship description

*A brief description of a scholarship provided and motivation for giving away a scholarship. Additionally, it should include information on how many applicants will be awarded a scholarship.*

* Scholarship award

*A specified amount awarded to a student.*

* Scholarship deadline

*A specified deadline of scholarship application.*

* Scholarship eligibility

*The profile of a student who can apply for Decred scholarship. For example, Decred can invite only students who are over 18 years old and enrolled into a Computer Science university program to apply.*

* Scholarship requirements

*A list of documents or information to be provided by the applicant. For example, Decred could ask applicants to provide their Decred address to which scholarship funds would be sent. This would motivate students to get informed about Decred and Decred wallet and address.*

* Recurrence information

*scholarshipowl.com allows and invites multiple instances of the same scholarship. More precisely, Decred scholarship can be posted once every month. For example, Decred could award 10 DCR each month to 5 students i.e. 50 DCR total.*

**Choosing winners**

Applicant information and completed applications would be submitted to Decred after the deadline of a scholarship application has been reached in a CSV file or via email. scholarshipowl.com is open towards any other form of applicant data submission. Decred could chose scholarship winner or winners as to their criteria, however, scholarshipowl.com could provide guidance and assistance in this process. After winner or winners have been chosen the announcement would be posted on scholarshipowl.com website. 

**Benefits**

A clear benefit of offering a scholarship or scholarships to students is to provide financial assistance to students looking for higher education. However, helping young students fund their education is not the only benefit. More precisely, Decred can do the market education by getting students acquainted with blockchain technology and cryptocurrency market by bringing them closer to it. Additionally, by offering a cryptocurrency scholarship, Decred will not only bring young generations closer to blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, but would move blockchain technology into the education industry.

scholarshipowl.com is working towards creating a scholarship management platform where scholarship providers can have a full control of their scholarship posting. Additionally, scholarship providers will have a full control of the application management process. The main goal of having a scholarship management platform is to increase transparency of the scholarship application process and provide a clear, instant feedback to the user on the stage of his application. scholarshipowl.com is working on making scholarship application process fair and transparent. This is relevant for Decred as they can move their decentralizing blockchain efforts into the market of education which could be only an initial step in the partnership with scholarshipowl.com. Education industry has been a highly centralized and untransparent area and Decred could help scholarshipowl.com in revolutionizing education and scholarship markets. 

Finally, Decred could gain early access to Computer Science students and young talents that can be further engaged and helped.

In this post, I will provide a fee analysis to show why that simply is not true.  I originally posted this in response to another comment, but I thought it warranted its own post, because it is something that seems to be a widespread misunderstanding.

For some background, prior to the vote to change the ticket price algorithm, the ticket prices swung wildly which encouraged all tickets to be purchased during a single interval when the price was artificially low, followed by discouraging any purchases at all for several intervals due to the price becoming artificially high.  This led to intense fee competition during the single interval where tickets could reasonably be purchased.

The result, naturally, was that proof-of-work miners were making extremely high fees during those low ticket fee intervals because stakeholders were having to fight to get their tickets in by paying massively inflated fees.  This can easily be seen by looking at the blocks on a block explorer and calculating the fees.  For example, consider blocks [146304](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/block/146304) through [146447](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/block/146447) which was a low interval for the ticket price at 44.46486818 DCR.  The total fees paid to PoW miners during that period was a whopping **787.07299693 DCR**.  Now compare that to the interval after it from [146448](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/block/146448)  through [146591](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/block/146591), which had a ticket price of 124.44844438 DCR, and only paid total fees of **8.49359368 DCR**.

We can also compare it to after the vote passed and the new algorithm settled in for blocks [154368](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/block/154368) through [154511](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/block/154511).  Despite the ticket price being at a local low of 57.27380227 DCR, the total fees paid was **7.76477816 DCR**.

So, as demonstrated, the fact is that PoW miners had a **huge** incentive to keep the ticket algorithm the same, yet the vote passed and the hard fork happened regardless.  I ask you to consider how difficult that change would be in a pure PoW coin.  I would argue that making the change was far more controversial than the entire multi-year block size debate in Bitcoin, but even if you don't agree with that assessment, it is difficult to argue that a ~100x cut in miner profits was not a controversial change.","false","8l897q",NA,0,NA,"false",1529754968,"false","self","t5_30fo6","false","serene8",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/decred/comments/8l897q/the_ticket_price_algorithm_vote_was_controversial/","t3_8l897q",NA,NA,"Educational","",0,1

I've spent a year and a half researching what makes a good wealth-security network. I believe Decred has come to the the top of my list. I'm now looking to expand my investment in the DCR by mining and staking the network. Before I dump a tone of energy and recources into this projects I'd like to propose some questions and hear the opinions of others. 

1) Decentralization: This is a buzz word that gets thrown around a lot. I understand the governance model of DCR well. However I do have one fear. That is the vulnerability of the Dev team. This project revolves around a core group of developers who are vulnerable due to their transparency. People know who they are and where they live. The vulnerability that creates in the continued progression is a bit worrying. Just how important are these members to the success of the network?

2) Company 0 and Decred Holding Group: Once again, the thought of centralized entity having weight over the projects future raises some fear. When is c0 going to detach from DCR? When Decred Holding Group does release the DCR dev fund and distance themselves, who will manage the development fund? How will these two central authorities be removed. I've yet to see a real plan proposed to the public. I want to know how this will be carried out. A DAO is a great idea. But is it actually possible?

3) Advertising: If this is a decentralized network and we're actively moving to let it stand alone, without influence: who will manage the Advertising for DCR? And how will that be handled once c0 and DHC has let go of the network? Is the goal to build a DEX that handles exchange in DCR and let the hype of that spread through the echo system? If so, how realistic is the DEX launching in the next 24 months?

4) Node scale: What is the active strategy the user pool is advocating to further decentralising the network? The node distribution of DCR is weak in comparison to other networks. DCR has a wonderful dev team, an amazing governance system, an ethical launch and a devoted user base. But how do we keep the network free of bad actors with only 260 active nodes currently running the network? Leave it to chance? What are some strategies we can employ to incentivise more nodes? We currently have zero nodes in Africa, one Node in Austria, one Node in South America and a vast desert of Nodes across most of central and western Asia. 

I am not here to FUD Decred. I'm seriously one if the networks biggest fans. But I'm not a technically savvy person. I joined the Forum recently in the hopes that I could find the answers. But I either didn't understand what I was reading or I didn't find the details discussion. Honestly the Forum seems pretty dead. So I'm here looking for answers. I hope some of you who are smarter and more informed will help me find the answers I'm looking for.

## What is Decred?

Decred is an autonomous digital currency, similar to Bitcoin, with a strong focus on governance, sustainable funding and development. It utilizes a hybrid proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus system to secure the flow of transactions. All changes to the Decred network are made with direct community input and settled with a consensus vote. A unit of currency is called a ‘decred’ (DCR). All the code of the Decred project is open source.

I realize this might be somewhat of a dumb post, but I am currently running Decrediton v1.2.1 and I had swapped my wallet to the Testnet to try out some things and I enjoyed it, but now I am attempting to switch back to the Mainnet.

I read through the documentation regarding swapping between the two and it states that I can switch between them by going to the settings and changing the Network setting. However, when I go into the Settings once I've launched my wallet, I only see General and Secuirty settings.

#####What is Politeia? 

Decred is evolving into a Decentralized Autonomous Entity (DAE). This allows everyone to participate in the development of Decred and receive funding from the project fund. This fund currently holds more than 500K DCR and it will be at the disposal of Decred stakeholders through Politeia. Read more here: https://medium.com/decred/governance-of-the-decred-project-subsidy-through-politeia-e6393b2bab1f

#####How does Politeia work?

Stakeholders can create an account and propose new ideas. After that, ticket holders will vote which ideas are considered for funding. In order to receive high quality proposals, a default proposal template was created: https://github.com/decred/politeia/blob/92a1926331e9a72f2e415c79a29b98acfdafa801/politeia.md

#####Why should I care?

Politeia can be used as an off-chain governance tool to formalize the proposal and/or budgeting processes for decentralized projects. Since it is censorship resistant, its use-cases extend beyond blockchain projects, as demonstrated by the Politeia Challenge: https://btcmanager.com/decreds-politeia-challenge-overview-winners/

#####You can help testing this innovative platform!

Read more about testing here: https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/265 You can give feedback in the comment section of this Reddit thread, in the #Politeia channel [on Slack](https://slack.decred.org) or directly on GitHub. It is important that many people test Politeia before we move to mainnet.

2) When I installed Decrediton, I immediately restored a master seed I already had from web wallet use (I didn't create a new account/wallet). I see my restored wallet/seed listed in the Accounts page as ""default"" with the proper balance. But there's also an ""imported"" account listed there with zero balance.

As of now, it's downloading to my SSD.   


When the daemon is running, I open a separate command prompt, and open dcrwallet.exe, but it says:  
""2018-06-25 21:47:09.070 \[INF\] WLLT: Connecting block 0000000000000bb5d118a8af573e58dd2391e35d6aeccd1900bbf87a28b54304, height 88006"".  


Not sure what it means, but that seems really similar to the language in the daemon command prompt.   
The point is, the wallet command prompt is constantly giving these ""connecting block"" messages, and I can't enter any commands.   


So how do I redirect my daemon?

The [recent hardfork](https://blog.z.cash/overwinter-activated-successfully/) by Zcash made me think about our practices for communicating consensus upgrades in advance.

* Do we proactively reach exchanges, processors and other services to help them prepare for consensus upgrades ([example](https://z.cash/upgrade/overwinter.html))?
* Do we have a standard procedure for media campaign to have the upgrade notice reach as many eyes as possible?
* Are there features in software to incentivize readiness for frequent non-backwards compatible upgrades ([example](https://blog.z.cash/overwinter-activated-successfully/))? Some possible ways:
  * all user-facing bits of dcrd (logging, --help, man, the docs) remind the admin to be prepared
  * dcrd detects and loudly reports signaling or actual use of features not recognized by it

# Development

dcrd: Significant [optimization](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1179) in signature hash calculation, bloom filters support was [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1162), 2x faster startup thanks to in-memory [full block index](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1229), multipeer work [advancing](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1145), stronger [protection](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1235) against majority hashpower attacks. Additionally, code refactoring and cleanup, code and test infrastructure improvements.

In dcrd and dcrwallet developers have been [experimenting](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1223) with new modular dependency and versioning schemes using vgo. @orthomind is seeking feedback for his work on [reproducible builds](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/pull/78).

Decrediton: 1.2.1 bugfix [release](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.2.1), work on SPV [has started](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1389), chart additions are in progress. Further simplification of the staking process is in the pipeline ([slack](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C5H9Z63AA/p1525528370000062)).

Politeia: new [command line tool](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/267) to interact with Politeia API, general development is ongoing. Help with testing will soon be welcome: this [issue](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/265) sets out a test plan, join [#politeia](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C88HEA7DK) to follow progress and participate in testing.

dcrdata: work ongoing on [improved design](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/451), adding [more charts](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/463) and improving Insight API support.

Android: design work [advancing](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues/80).

Decred's own DNS seeder ([dcrseeder](https://github.com/decred/dcrseeder)) was [released](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/996442267538751488). It is written in Go and it properly supports service bit filtering, which will allow SPV nodes to find full nodes that support compact filters.

Ticket splitting service by @matheusd [entered](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/997560763727265792) beta and [demonstrated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsVJ1WWsWlA) an 11-way split on mainnet. Help with testing is much appreciated, please join [#ticket_splitting](https://decred.slack.com/messages/CAUF860P3/) to participate in splits, but check [this doc](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher/blob/master/docs/beta.md) to learn about the risks. Reddit discussion [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8kgrqg/what_many_of_you_have_been_waiting_for_ticket/).

Trezor support is [expected](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3PBR19L4/p1525638426000046) to land in their [next firmware update](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-mcu/milestone/2?closed=1).

Decred is now [supported](https://medium.com/summa-technology/introducing-riemann-7c1c3cb4a52) by Riemann, a toolbox from James Prestwich to construct transactions for many UTXO-based chains from human-readable strings.

Atomic swap with Ethereum on testnet was [demonstrated](https://twitter.com/bebrites/status/1001200089283678209) at Blockspot Conference LATAM.

Two new faces were [added](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/commit/9a410a33c2e3dc95405c264523d28c43678123e6) to [contributors](https://decred.org/contributors/) page.

Dev activity stats for May: 238 active PRs, 195 master commits, 32,831 added and 22,280 deleted lines spread across 8 repositories. Contributions came from 4-10 developers per repository. ([chart](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1002963653778214912))

# Network

Hashrate: rapid growth from ~4,000 TH/s at the beginning of the month to ~15,000 at the end with new all time high of 17,949. Interesting dynamic in [hashrate distribution](https://dcred.eu/powStats) across mining pools: coinmine.pl share went down from 55% to 25% while F2Pool up from 2% to 44%. \[Note: as of June 6, the hashrate continues to rise and has already passed 22,000 TH/s\]

Staking: 30-day average ticket price is 91.3 DCR (+0.8), stake participation is 46.9% (+0.8%) with 3.68 million DCR locked (+0.15). Min price was 85.56. On May 11 ticket price surged to 96.99, staying elevated for longer than usual after such a pump. Locked DCR peaked at 47.17%. jet_user on reddit [suggested](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8ixay1/decred_investment_thesis_by_placeholder_ventures/dyvpgg5/?context=3) that the DCR for these tickets likely came from a miner with significant hashrate.

Nodes: there are 226 public listening and 405 normal nodes per [dcred.eu](https://dcred.eu/nodeStats). Version distribution: 45% on v1.2.0 (up from 24% last month), 39% on v1.1.2, 15% on v1.1.0 and 1% running outdaded versions.

# ASICs

Obelisk team [posted](https://medium.com/obelisk-blog/obelisk-update-january-may-2018-739229a930ec) an update. Current hashrate estimate of DCR1 is 1200 GH/s at 500 W and may still change. The chips came back at 40% the speed of the simulated results, it is still unknown why. Batch 1 units may get delayed 1-2 weeks past June 30. See discussions [on r/decred](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8hzhjm/obelisk_update_januarymay_2018_obelisk_blog_medium/) and [on r/siacoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/siacoin/comments/8hzgkr/obelisk_update_januarymay_2018/).

@SiaBillionaire [estimated](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3P6R055Z/p1526221654000039) that 7940 DCR1 units were sold in Batches 1-5, while Lynmar13 [shared](https://medium.com/@brian7249694/the-current-state-of-the-obelisk-dcr1-fff97f6877be) his projections of DCR1 profitability ([reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8lgbv2/the_current_state_of_the_obelisk_dcr1/)).

A new Chinese miner for pre-order was noticed by our Telegram group. Woodpecker WB2 specs 1.5 TH/s at 1200 W, costs 15,000 CNY (~2,340 USD) and the initial 150 units are expected to ship on Aug 15. ([pow8.com](https://pow8.com/product.php) – [translated](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=https://pow8.com/product.php))

Another new miner is iBelink DSM6T: 6 TH/s at 2100 W costing $6,300 ([ibelink.co](https://ibelink.co/product/ibelink-dsm6t-blake256-miner-with-6-th-s-hash-rate/)). Shipping starts from June 5. Some concerns and links were posted in these [two](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8kutc4/ibelink_6th_miner/) [threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8ljg9t/ibelink_decred_miner_available/dzg8f7v/).

Placeholder Ventures [announced](https://twitter.com/placeholdervc/status/995339882867380224) that Decred is their [first](https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/995340580673769475) public investment. Their [Investment Thesis](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2018/5/12/decred-investment-thesis) is a clear and well researched overview of Decred. Among other great points it noted the less obvious benefit of not doing an ICO:

&gt; By choosing not to pre-sell coins to speculators, the financial rewards from Decred’s growth most favor those who work for the network.

Alex Evans, a cryptoeconomics researcher who recently joined Placeholder, [posted](https://twitter.com/alexhevans/status/1002232216875872257) his 13-page [Decred Network Analysis](https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPBqq3g3LuXiauZdaEcNtQUQ3QUTJUSnT8XuBXPw2be6V/Decred%20Analysis%20-%20Alex.pdf).

@R3VoLuT1OneR posted a preview of a [proposal](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8jbhgc/decred_cryptocurrency_scholarship_proposal/) from his company for Decred to offer scholarships for students.

[r/dcrtrader](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dcrtrader/) gained a couple of new moderators, weekly automatic threads were reconfigured to monthly and empty threads were removed. Currently most trading talk happens on #trading and some leaks to r/decred. A separate trading sub offers some advantages: unlimited trading talk, broad range of allowed topics, free speech and transparent moderation, in addition to standard reddit threaded discussion, permanent history and search.

Forum: potential [social attacks](https://forum.decred.org/threads/a-potential-social-attack-on-decred.5995/) on Decred.

Slack: the [#governance](https://decred.slack.com/messages/CAAMEU56W/) channel created last month has seen many intelligent conversations on topics including: finite attention of decision makers, why stakeholders _can_ make good decisions (opposed to a common narrative than only developers are capable of making good decisions), proposal funding and contractor pre-qualification, Cardano and Dash treasuries, quadratic voting, equality of outcome vs equality of opportunity, and much more.

One particularly important issue being discussed is the growing number of posts arguing that on-chain governance and coin voting is bad. Just a few examples from Twitter: Decred is solving an [imagined problem](https://twitter.com/nwoodfine/status/999181111115661312) (decent [response](https://twitter.com/jm_buirski/status/999271148348170241) by @jm_buirski), we [convince](https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/999691029514252289) ourselves that we need governance and ticket price algo vote was not controversial, on-chain governance [hurts](https://twitter.com/panekkkk/status/999758289230589952) node operators and it is [too early](https://twitter.com/panekkkk/status/999758294750257153) for it, it [robs](https://twitter.com/VladZamfir/status/935587447584440320) node operators of their role, crypto risks being [captured](https://twitter.com/VladZamfir/status/999921949370269698) by the wealthy, it is a [huge threat](https://twitter.com/VladZamfir/status/935589574075543552) to the whole public blockchain space, coin holders [should not](https://twitter.com/VladZamfir/status/971379367187230720) own the blockchain.

# Markets

The month of May has seen Decred earn some much deserved attention in the markets. DCR started the month around 0.009 BTC and finished around 0.0125 with interim high of 0.0165 on Bittrex. In USD terms it started around $81 and finished around $92, temporarily rising to $118. During a period in which most altcoins suffered, Decred has performed well; rising from rank #45 to #30 on Coinmarketcap.

The addition of a much awaited KRW pair on Upbit saw the price briefly double on some exchanges. This pair opens up direct DCR to fiat trading in one of the largest cryptocurrency markets in the world.

An update from @i2Rav:

&gt; We have begun trading DCR in large volume daily. The interest around DCR has really started to grow in terms of OTC quote requests. More and more customers are asking about trading it.

Like in previous month, Decred scores high by ""% down from ATH"" indicator being #2 on [onchainfx](https://onchainfx.com/) as of June 6.

David Vorick (@taek) [published](https://blog.sia.tech/the-state-of-cryptocurrency-mining-538004a37f9b) lots of insights into the world of ASIC manufacturing ([reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8jjyca/the_state_of_cryptocurrency_mining_by_david_vorick/)). Bitmain [replied](https://blog.bitmain.com/en/bitmain-sia-state-cryptocurrency-mining/).

Bitmain [released](https://shop.bitmain.com/product/detail?pid=00020180503154806494uGcSyiu806FD) an ASIC for Equihash ([archived](https://archive.today/uKewv)), an algorithm [thought](https://blog.z.cash/why-equihash/) to be somewhat ASIC-resistant 2 years ago.

[Three](https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-gold-hit-by-double-spend-attack-exchanges-lose-millions/) [pure PoW](https://cryptovest.com/news/verge-xvg-hacked-again-scrypt-mining-takes-over-entire-network/) [coins](https://www.ccn.com/japanese-cryptocurrency-monacoin-hit-by-selfish-mining-attack/) were [attacked](https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/998913369741590529) this month, one attempting to be ASIC resistant. This shows the importance of Decred's PoS layer that exerts control over miners and allows Decred to welcome ASIC miners for more PoW security without sacrificing sovereignty to them.

Upbit was [raided](https://www.coindesk.com/koreas-biggest-crypto-exchange-raided-over-suspected-fraud-report/) over suspected fraud and put under investigation. Following news [reported](https://www.ccn.com/upbit-audit-confirms-south-koreas-biggest-cryptocurrency-exchange-not-at-fault/) no illicit activity was found and [suggested](http://news.8btc.com/south-koreas-premature-raid-of-its-biggest-cryptocurrency-exchange-distraughts-investors) and raid was premature and damaged trust in local exchanges.

Circle, the new owner of Poloniex, [announced](https://blog.circle.com/2018/05/15/circle-announces-usd-coin-bitmain-partnership-and-new-strategic-financing/) a USD-backed stablecoin and Bitmain partnership. The plan is to make USDC available as a primary market on Poloniex. More details in the [FAQ](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc-faq).

Poloniex [announced](https://poloniex.com/press-releases/2018.05.01-Coming-May-15-consistent-competitive-trading-fees/) lower trading fees.

Bittrex [plans](https://www.ccn.com/washington-based-bittrex-lists-usd-trading-pairs-after-landing-banking-partner/) to offer USD trading pairs.

@sumiflow made good progress on correcting Decred market cap on several sites:

&gt; speaking of market cap, I got it corrected on coingecko, cryptocompare, and worldcoinindex  
&gt; onchainfx, livecoinwatch, and cryptoindex.co said they would update it about a month ago but haven't yet  
&gt; I messaged coinlib.io today but haven't got a response yet  
&gt; coinmarketcap refused to correct it until they can verify certain funds have moved from dev wallets which is most likely forever unknowable ([slack](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3PBR19L4/p1526502065000421))

# About This Issue

Some source links point to Slack messages. Although Slack hides history older than ~5 days, you can read individual messages if you paste the message link into chat with yourself. Digging the full conversation is hard but possible. The history of all channels bridged to Matrix is saved in Matrix. Therefore it is possible to dig history in Matrix if you know the timestamp of the first message. Slack links encode the timestamp: `https://decred.slack.com/archives/C5H9Z63AA/p1525528370000062` =&gt; `1525528370` =&gt; `2018-05-05 13:52:50`.

In short, *GROUP* accomplishes much of what launching Ethereum on top of Bitcoin would accomplish. Which is to say, it's a *huge* innovation.

By implementing GROUP, Bitcoin Cash stands to enable *native* blockchain equities issuance, loan markets, options and prediction markets; along with all the usual ""colored coins"" use cases e.g. supply chain tracking systems, in-game items, cryptokitties and so on.

Let me preface this next part by saying we should be studying our competitors, even using their products outright, in order to keep a close ear on where Decred stands relative to the wider cryptocurrency industry. To help you understand why the GROUP situation on Bitcoin Cash may matter for Decred, some background on the current state of Bitcoin Cash is in order.

In late 2017, Bitcoin Cash launched as a coinsplit from the Bitcoin Core consensus by a French developer named Amaury Séchet via his ""BitcoinABC"" full node implementation. Owing to his many contributions to the BTC-BCH coinsplit, Amaury has since become Bitcoin Cash's benevolent dictator.

Pertinent here is the fact Amaury has voiced heavy skepticism towards GROUP. In remarks made during and after a recent Bitcoin Cash [developer meetup](https://youtu.be/ZwhsKdXRIXI), Amaury repeatedly claimed there are ""no use cases"" whatsoever for GROUP. Amaury has made it clear so long as he's BDFL of Bitcoin Cash, the GROUP proposal is effectively frozen out.

Instead, Amaury thinks Bitcoin Cash should strive to be ""cash only"". And if Bitcoin Cash is to do smart contracts, it should be done through OP_RETURN systems like [Counterparty](https://counterparty.io) and colored coins protocols.

To grok the significance of this, you have to first understand [OP_RETURN's pitfalls](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8zxfu5/introducing_simple_ledger_protocol_slp_a_token/e2modo8).

As one of the most outspoken proponents of a [certain OP_RETURN system](https://counterparty.io) on the internet, turns out I'm in a pretty decent position to explain where OP_RETURN systems get it wrong. Since Counterparty is essentially a superset of colored coins (see: Vitalik Buterin's [""strictly superior"" comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2is4us/whats_wrong_with_counterparty/cl4zmmk/)), I'm going to use the word ""Counterparty"" as a stand-in for all other OP_RETURN approaches. Once you understand Counterparty's pitfalls, you'll *also understand* the pitfalls of *all other* OP_RETURN colored coin schemes, which is what Amaury is advocating for in lieu of activating *GROUP*.

Essentially, the chief error in Counterparty is its way of building its own blockchain. Namely, Counterparty transforms unvalidated metadata hidden within regular Bitcoin transactions inluded in the Bitcoin blockchain, into a ""meta-blockchain"".

As an analogy for how Counterparty works, imagine if you would each block in the Bitcoin blockchain as a cardboard box. Counterparty works by inscribing these boxes with its own (Egyptian, say) *hieroglyphs*. Bitcoin miners don't understand what the heck these hieroglyphs mean. They just shrug and stack the cardboard boxes one on top of the other to build the blockchain. Bitcoin miners ignore the hieroglyphs completely.

Extending this analogy further, then Alice comes along with `counterpartyd`, the software implementation of a Counterparty full node. Alice's `counterpartyd` scans the Bitcoin blockchain for hieroglyphs. `counterpartyd` reads these hieroglyphs and interprets them for Alice. This is possible because the hieroglyphs contain instructions understood by `counterpartyd`. In turn, Alice's `counterpartyd` builds what **it** considers to be the ""Counterparty blockchain"".

But since Bitcoin PoW miners never validated the hieroglyphs Alice's `counterpartyd` full node consumed, Alice's `counterpartyd` daemon has to be on guard while it's building its own view of the Counterparty blockchain. Literally anyone can write anything they want into these hieroglyphs. Specifically, an attacker can craft his own hieroglyphs in a way which instructs the Counterparty blockchain to reassign funds from victims to an attacker-controlled account, or worse.

Because of this, `counterpartyd` can't merely *read* the hieroglyphs and take the instructions contained therein at face value; `counterpartyd` must also *validate* all of these hieroglyphs. It has to check for double-spends and theft. It has to do *all the things* Bitcoin PoW miners are tasked with doing.

But there's one key difference. Alice's `counterpartyd` full node can't *prove* to other full nodes that her view of the Counterparty blockchain is correct. This is because Counterparty does not have any miners competing in terms of hashrate to extend the Counterparty blockchain. Counterparty has no notion of accumulated hashrate. Hence when two `counterpartyd` full nodes disagree upon the results of this validation effort, they have no way of deciding which view of the blockchain is correct.

IOW, Counterparty's consensus model is highly volatile. The instant two nodes disagree, they have no way of getting back into agreement except by introducing some inherently centralized human element. Maybe Poloniex insists on *its* `counterpartyd` being the right view of the Counterparty blockchain. It then becomes Alice's word against Polo's.

And it gets worse. Since Counterparty has no PoW miners, Counterparty light wallets can't use block depth as a proxy for a Counterparty transaction's validity. For this reason, true SPV support is flat out impossible to implement in today's OP_RETURN systems.

But it's Counterparty's consensus model (or lackthereof) that seals its fate as being a second class protocol.

The bottom line is all ""colored coin"" systems are second-class citizens of the blockchain world. They're second-class citizens which lack a well-defined consensus model, and lack SPV support. It would be hard to argue the adoption of these systems to any self-respecting developer involved in commercial tokenization.

Andrew Stone's *GROUP* proposal solves all these problems encountered by OP_RETURN tokenization systems. By introducing an unprecedented *miner-validated* tokenization system for Bitcoin, `GROUP`-ed tokens get SPV support and they inherit Bitcoin's time-tested consensus model. In addition, GROUP enables tokenization without introducing a new Bitcoin scripting system, nor does it require developing an Ethereum-like VM. GROUP doesn't require introducing an XCP-like token in the middle, either. Suffice to say, as a huge proponent of Counterparty, the advantages of /u/thezerg1's GROUP proposal are *overwhelming*. Alternative tokenization approaches are just not competitive.

I wanted to bring GROUP to the Decred community's attention because A) it's evidently being blocked by top Bitcoin Cash developers, and B) it's something we should be looking into given our focus on Distributed Autonomous Entities. I think it's fair to say there's at least going to be demand for blockchain equity issuance on Decred, and people are going to want SPV and a half-decent consensus model for those tokens.

To me and /u/thezerg1, the blockage of GROUP feels [strangely familiar](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/6wxueo/your_best_pitch_for_decred/dmcer4d/). Namely, Vitalik Buterin launched Ethereum as a separate blockchain instead of launching it on Bitcoin primarily because the usual suspects of Bitcoin vehemently rejected on-chain tokenization in favor of off-chain approaches. What Amaury Séchet is doing with Bitcoin Cash today is rejecting Andrew Stone's *native* tokenization system in favor of poorly thought-out, validationless ones from yesteryear.

As a Decred stakeminer, I'd like to publicly extend my gratitude to Andrew Stone for showing the world Bitcoin-like systems can be just as capable as Ethereum, and better designed as well. I'd personally love to see a GROUP proposal on Politeia, and should Andrew Stone be up for it, I'm sure we could find a way to sponsor his development efforts on top of Decred.",NA,"90sdif",NA,0,NA,"false",1536643704,"false","self","t5_30fo6","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/decred/comments/90sdif/group_and_the_potential_of_pow_minervalidated/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

&gt;Thanks for reaching out! While we can certainly understand any frustrations given this minor delay in shipping, Obelisk is not offering refunds at this time. All previously stated shipping dates have been estimates as it is impossible to predict unexpected delays in manufacturing or unforeseen set backs.

&gt;Right now we expect to ship our batch one units by about mid-July, just a few weeks past our original estimate. As soon as we have a concrete date we will be sure to update the community.

I am running a Synology NAS server and wanted to run a Decred node on it.  
 I have therefore added Decred to my docker node image builder, images are built and published on Docker Hub at [https://hub.docker.com/r/r0shii/cryptonodes/](https://hub.docker.com/r/r0shii/cryptonodes/)  
 

For those who wanna have a look at sources: [https://github.com/roshii/docker-cryptonodes](https://github.com/roshii/docker-cryptonodes)  
 I still have to rewrite readme and a few other files but node is fully functional as is :)  
 

Help is always welcome for improvement!

I see there is a 1.27% roi per ticket, lets say i buy a ticket when it costs 100 dcr, will it give me 101.27 when it votes, or will i get 1.27% based on the votes current ticket price?

so if in a month i get to vote and the price is 50 dcr am i only getting 50.635 dcr?

and is the ticket system the only way to earn decred? do i need to run my wallet 24/7 while i hold the ticket?

This is HUGE. Low end hardware wallet support and private sending of coins. I hear the light wallet SPV is better then Bitcoin's electrum in regards to transaction privacy as well. Maybe a few more large exchanges will wake up after this is all added to an upcoming release, and get Decred some more liquidity to go with it (slippage is still a nightmare buying / selling).

I recently bought an “FFminer Decred D18” and received the product yesterday. I am new to mining but been an investor for a long time, I wanted to try mining as a hobby. So far I powered it up and found the IP address that was connected to my network, logged in with that, “root” information. That IP address I logged into had no english so it made things interesting. Took awhile but I copied the stratum F2pool and pasted and also copied my exodus decred address and pasted that information. It started mining and it’s currently mining. The only question is, would I now need to go to F2pool website and setup from there to get my payouts? Or do you just set it up from that IP address that is connected to your network and start mining? Location US.

Any help would be appreciated

So we created a Decred group for this in StatX.

StatX now shows a live dashboard of DCR market data (market cap, price, volume, total supply) and also API-fed data from the Decred blockchain (ticket price, ticket pool size, emission share). We also have roadmap updates (done manually by the good folks at Decred). You get convenient push notifications when something changes. And the app provides in-context chat with other members of the Decred group - so you can discuss Decred in the context of the dashboard data.

There was talk about the future financing of Decred based projects.

Unfortunately, I didn't get the details.

Where can one submit potential projects and who decides about the amount of funding?

I assume it's done by the community within the Politea. 

Are there any proposals for funding right now?
If anybody has something to read up on it, I would be very grateful.

# Development

The biggest announcement of the month was the new kind of decentralized exchange [proposed](https://blog.decred.org/2018/06/05/A-New-Kind-of-DEX/) by @jy-p of Company 0. The Community Discussions section considers the stakeholders' response.

dcrd: Peer management and connectivity improvements. Some work for [improved sighash algo](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/950). A new [optimization](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1273) that gives 3-4x faster serving of headers, which is great for SPV. This was another step towards multipeer parallel downloads – check [this issue](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1145) for a clear overview of progress and planned work for next months (and some engineering delight). As usual, codebase cleanup, improvements to error handling, test infrastructure and test coverage.

Decrediton: work towards watching only wallets, lots of bugfixes and visual design improvements. Preliminary work to integrate SPV has begun.

Politeia is live on testnet! Useful links: [announcement](https://twitter.com/marco_peereboom/status/1009552512968482818), [introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8sn1b8/test_the_politeia_proposal_system_on_testnet/), command line voting [example](https://gist.github.com/marcopeereboom/ee494a6864086e0b5a4ac8886a9c0397), [example proposal](https://test-proposals.decred.org/proposals/c5241806166d89286be56cd2605e7d76537eb32a40a8f8d8bde3bff4c2fc6585/) with some votes, [mini-guide](https://github.com/decred/politeia/blob/master/politeia.md) how to compose a proposal.

Trezor: Decred appeared in the [firmware update](https://blog.trezor.io/june-updates-trezor-one-firmware-wallet-zcash-cashaddr-doge-e21cbdf9807d) and on [Trezor website](https://trezor.io/coins/#DCR), currently for testnet only. Next steps are mainnet support and integration in wallets. For the progress of Decrediton support you can track [this meta issue](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/1491).

dcrdata: Continued work on Insight API support, see this [meta issue](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/400) for progress overview. It is important for integrations due to its popularity. Ongoing work to add charts. A big database change to improve sorting on the Address page was [merged](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/commit/006685be846ac9cfe7b9b76eebabdb7bffdaad18) and bumped version to 3.0. Work to visualize agenda voting [continues](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/523).

Ticket splitting: 11-way ticket split from last month [has voted](https://twitter.com/matheusd_tech/status/1007610236868399104) ([transaction](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/tx/957728a7b3b9ea02338552470535ca67a6bc4379b169959589b8a69060e764a8)).

Ethereum support in atomicswap is [progressing](https://github.com/decred/atomicswap/issues/74) and welcomes more eyeballs.

decred.org: revamped [Press page](https://decred.org/press/) with dozens of added articles, and a shiny new [Roadmap page](https://decred.org/roadmap/).

[decredinfo.com](https://decredinfo.com/): a new Decred dashboard by lte13. Reddit announcement [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8tcs49/decredinfo_block_explorer_and_statistics_for/).

Dev activity stats for June: 245 active PRs, 184 master commits, 25,973 added and 13,575 deleted lines spread across 8 repositories. Contributions came from 2 to 10 developers per repository. ([chart](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1014267793041248257))

# Network

Hashrate: growth continues, the month started at 15 and ended at 44 PH/s with some wild 30% swings on the way. The peak was 53.9 PH/s.

F2Pool was the leader varying between 36% and 59% hashrate, followed by coinmine.pl holding between 18% and 29%. In response to concerns about its hashrate share, F2Pool made a [statement](https://www.f2pool.com/help/profits/annoce) that they will consider measures like rising the fees to prevent growing to 51%.

Staking: 30-day average ticket price is 94.7 DCR (+3.4). The price was steadily rising from 90.7 to 95.8 peaking at 98.1. Locked DCR grew from 3.68 to 3.81 million DCR, the highest value was 3.83 million corresponding to 47.87% of supply (+0.7% from previous peak).

Nodes: there are 240 public listening and 115 normal nodes per [dcred.eu](https://dcred.eu/nodeStats). Version distribution: 57% on v1.2.0 (+12%), 25% on v1.1.2 (-13%), 14% on v1.1.0 (-1%). Note: the reported count of non-listening nodes has dropped significantly due to data reset at decred.eu. It will take some time before the crawler collects more data. On top of that, there is no way to exactly count non-listening nodes. To illustrate, an alternative data source, charts.dcr.farm [showed](https://charts.dcr.farm/d/000000015/nodes-map) 690 reachable nodes on Jul 1.

Extraordinary event: [247361](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/block/247361) and [247362](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/block/247362) were two nearly full blocks. Normally blocks are 10-20 KiB, but these blocks were 374 KiB (max is 384 KiB).

# ASICs

[Update](https://medium.com/obelisk-blog/obelisk-update-may-june-2018-260fce12a825) from Obelisk: shipping is expected in first half of July and there is non-zero chance to meet hashrate target.

Another Chinese ASIC [spotted](https://www.dcrbi.com/) on the web: Flying Fish D18 with 340 GH/s at 180 W costing 2,200 CNY (~340 USD). ([asicok.com](https://asicok.com/d18.html) – [translated](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;u=https://asicok.com/d18.html), also on [asicminervalue](https://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/ffminer/decred-d18))

dcrASIC team [posted](https://medium.com/@dcrasic/farewell-from-dcrasic-5327953088b0) a farewell letter. Despite having an awesome 16 nm chip design, they decided to stop the project citing the saturated mining ecosystem and low profitability for their potential customers.

# Integrations

[bepool.org](http://beepool.org/) is a new mining pool [spotted](https://dcred.eu/powStats) on dcred.eu.

Exchange integrations:

* Huobi Pro [added](https://www.huobipro.com/notice_detail/?id=1855) DCR/BTC and DCR/ETH pairs.
* OKEx gradually [rolled out](https://support.okex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004847791-Decred-DCR-Now-Available) trading DCR to BTC, ETH, USDT and OKB and added [a page](https://support.okex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004847771-Decred-DCR-) for Decred (note a bunch of N/As for ICO-related stats).
* Singapore-based DragonEx [announced](https://twitter.com/Dragonex_io/status/1007229686328356864) a DCR/ETH pair.
* Netherlands-based Bitvavo recently added [EUR to DCR](https://bitvavo.com/decred) conversion
* OOOBTC [announced](https://twitter.com/ooobtcExchange/status/1009076226655338497) DCR/USDT pair.
* Changenow [announced](https://twitter.com/ChangeNOW_io/status/1011242774585278464) the option to buy DCR with fiat.

Two OTC trading desks are now shown on decred.org [exchanges](https://decred.org/exchanges/) page.

[BitPro](https://bitpro.cc/) payment gateway added Decred and [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8og4he/bitpro_payment_gateway_adds_decred/) on Reddit. Notably, it is fully functional without javascript or cookies and does not ask for name or email, among other [features](https://bitpro.cc/start).

Guarda Wallet integrated Decred. Currently only in their web wallet, but more may come in future. Notable feature is ""DCR purchase with a bank card"". See more details in their [post](https://medium.com/guarda/guarda-adds-decred-support-to-the-multi-currency-web-wallet-7ec9b88a7738) or ask their representative on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8pa74w/guarda_announces_decred_is_now_on_our/). Important: do your best to understand the security model before using any wallet software.

# Adoption

Merchants:

* [NeverFiat](https://www.neverfiat.com/) marketplace now [accepts](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8v0ii9/we_are_building_tomorrows_crypto_marketplace/) Decred. Notably it utilizes [GloBee](https://globee.com/) and recently announced [Lightning support](https://neverfiat.com/blogs/blog/neverfiat-accepts-lightning-network-payments) for Bitcoin.
* [Crypto and Tech Gear](https://cryptoandtechgear.com/) [integrated](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8s5c0x/i_have_integrated_decred_as_a_payment_method_into/) Decred and has a branded mouse pad for sale, as well as [other merch](https://cryptoandtechgear.com/collections/decred-dcr-apparel-accessories).
* [TokenPride](https://tokenpride.com/): ""We are [seeking](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8v3tsx/decred_payment_integration/) feedback on the general setup of our payment processor. We have tried to make it simple and user friendly. 10% of all purchases made in Decred will be donated to the Decred Development fund - and we will be releasing original Decred designs in the future"".

BlueYard Capital [announced](https://twitter.com/blueyard/status/1007287271643598849) investment in Decred and the intent to be long term [supporters](https://twitter.com/ciaranoleary/status/1007288469952126977) and to actively participate in the network's governance. In an [overview post](https://medium.com/@BlueYard/decred-82b284b4a795) they stressed core values of the project:

&gt; There are a few other remarkable characteristics that are a testament to the DNA of the team behind Decred: there was no sale of DCR to investors, no venture funding, and no payment to exchanges to be listed – underscoring that the Decred team and contributors are all about doing the right thing for long term (as manifested in their [constitution](https://docs.decred.org/getting-started/constitution/) for the project).

&gt; The most encouraging thing we can see is both the quality and quantity of high calibre developers flocking to the project, in addition to a vibrant community attaching their identity to the project.

The company will be hosting an event in Berlin, see Events below.

Arbitrade is now [mining](https://arbitrade.io/newsletter/20180607_Domicile_Announcement_Exciting_News_and_Public_Correction.html) Decred.

Second iteration of Chinese ratings [released](http://special.ccidnet.com/pub-bc-eval/). Compared to the [first issue](https://archive.today/4Xhz6), Decred dropped from 26 to 29 while Bitcoin fell from 13 to 17. We (the authors) restrain ourselves commenting on this one.

  &gt; ""I think that developers in the future are going to base their decision on where to build on the basis of governance and community. And so I look for good governance mechanisms and strong communities in blockchains."" ([@decredproject](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1006631901560373248))

# Community Discussions

Community stats: Twitter followers 40,209 (+1,091), Reddit subscribers 8,410 (+243), Slack users 5,830 (+172), GitHub 392 stars and 918 forks of dcrd repository.

An update on our communication systems:

* Matrix chat logs [are now](https://twitter.com/joshrickmar/status/1007738206731816960) [viewable](https://gist.github.com/jrick/458eab91a650f24be4237a7db7662dd3) on the web with the exception of some channels that are not bridged. The new web logs means our chats are now fully public and indexed by search engines.
* Slack had an [outage](https://status.slack.com/2018-06/142edcb9e52c7663) on Jun 27 that disturbed communications for a few hours, discussions continued on Decred's bridged platforms.

Jake Yocom-Piatt did an [AMA on r/CryptoTechnology](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/8nujuo/hello_this_is_jake_yocompiatt_ask_me_anything/), a forum for serious crypto tech discussion. Some topics covered were Decred attack cost and resistance, voting policies, smart contracts, SPV security, DAO and DPoS.

[A new kind of DEX](https://blog.decred.org/2018/06/05/A-New-Kind-of-DEX/) was the subject of an extensive discussion in [#general](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C0NRMDVMJ/p1528209752000802), [#random](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3PAYQJTW/p1528211117000400), [#trading](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3PBR19L4/p1528209357000114) channels as well as [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8orxdf/a_new_kind_of_decentralized_exchange_dex/). New channel [#thedex](https://decred.slack.com/messages/CB1BDE40Z/) was created and attracted more than 100 people.

A frequent and fair question is how the DEX would benefit Decred. @lukebp has put it well:

&gt; Projects like these help Decred attract talent. Typically, the people that are the best at what they do aren’t driven solely by money.  They want to work on interesting projects that they believe in with other talented individuals.  
&gt; Launching a DEX that has no trading fees, no requirement to buy a 3rd party token (including Decred), and that cuts out all middlemen is a clear demonstration of the ethos that Decred was founded on.  It helps us get our name out there and attract the type of people that believe in the same mission that we do. ([slack](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3PAYQJTW/p1528212405000365))

Another concern that it will slow down other projects was addressed by @davecgh:

&gt; The intent is for an external team to take up the mantle and build it, so it won't have any bearing on the current c0 roadmap.  The important thing to keep in mind is that the goal of Decred is to have a bunch of independent teams on working on different things. ([slack](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3PBR19L4/p1528241447000199))

A [chat](https://twitter.com/AnselLindner/status/1003708357193150466) about Decred fork resistance started on Twitter and continued in [#trading](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3PBR19L4/p1528138824000839). Community members continue to discuss the finer points of Decred's hybrid system, bringing new users up to speed and answering their questions. The key takeaway from this chat is that the Decred chain is impossible to advance without votes, and to get around that the forker needs to change the protocol in a way that would make it clearly not Decred.

""Against community governance"" [article](https://medium.com/@decanus/against-community-governance-326dc82b27d3) was discussed on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8qhc3v/against_community_governance_by_dean_eigenmann/) and [#governance](https://decred.slack.com/archives/CAAMEU56W/p1528466175000149).

# Markets

DCR opened the month at ~$93, reached monthly high of $110, gradually dropped to the low of $58 and closed at $67. In BTC terms it was 0.0125 -&gt; 0.0150 -&gt; 0.0098 -&gt; 0.0105. The downturn coincided with a global decline across the whole crypto market.

In the middle of the month Decred was [noticed](https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/1007970492760969219) to be #1 in [onchainfx](https://onchainfx.com/) ""% down from ATH"" chart and on [this](https://twitter.com/coinztrader/status/1008379790250905601) chart by @CoinzTrader. Towards the end of the month it dropped to #3.

# Relevant External

Obelisk [announced](https://twitter.com/ObeliskTechHQ/status/1004441883458842629) Launchpad service. The [idea](https://medium.com/obelisk-blog/introducing-obelisk-launchpad-b78756eaa74c) is to work with coin developers to design a custom, ASIC-friendly PoW algorithm together with a first batch of ASICs and distribute them among the community.

Equihash-based ZenCash [was hit](https://blog.zencash.com/zencash-statement-on-double-spend-attack/) by a double spend attack that led to a loss of $450,000 by the exchange which was targeted.

Almost one year after collecting funds, Tezos [announced](http://tezosfoundation.ch/news/tezos-foundation-announces-kyc-aml/) a surprise identification procedure to claim tokens ([non-javascript version](https://archive.today/NeaAT)).

A hacker [broke into](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-breaches-syscoin-github-account-and-poisons-official-client/) Syscoin's GitHub account and implanted malware stealing passwords and private keys into Windows binaries. This is a painful reminder for everybody to [verify binaries](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/verifying-binaries/) after download.

Circle [announced](https://medium.com/circle-blog/introducing-the-circle-asset-framework-d89ee84b498a) new asset listing framework for Poloniex. Relevant to recent discussions of exchange listing bribery:

&gt; Please note: we will not accept any kind of payment to list an asset.

Zcash organized Zcon0, an event in Canada that focused on privacy tech and governance. An interesting [insight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioV7mBt7SMA&amp;t=830) from Keynote Panel on governance: ""There is no such thing as on-chain governance"".

Microsoft acquired GitHub. There was some debate about whether it is a reason to look into alternative solutions like GitLab right now. It is always a good idea to have a local copy of Decred [source code](https://github.com/decred), just in case.

Status update from @sumiflow on correcting DCR supply on various sites:

&gt; To begin with, none of the below sites were showing the correct supply or market cap for Decred but we've made some progress.  
&gt; coingecko.com, coinlib.io, cryptocompare.com, livecoinwatch.com, worldcoinindex.com - corrected!  
&gt; cryptoindex.co, onchainfx.com - awaiting fix  
&gt; coinmarketcap.com - refused to fix because devs have coins too? ([slack](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3PBR19L4/p1528500418000009))

# About This Issue

This is the third issue of Decred Journal after [April](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/journal/201804) and [May](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/journal/201805).

Most information from third parties is relayed directly from source after a minimal sanity check. The authors of Decred Journal have no ability to verify all claims. Please beware of scams and do your own research.

The new public [Matrix logs](https://gist.github.com/jrick/458eab91a650f24be4237a7db7662dd3) look promising and we hope to transition from Slack links to Matrix links. In the meantime, the way to read Slack links is [explained](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/journal/201805#about-this-issue) in the previous issue.

As usual, any feedback is appreciated: please comment on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8woriv/decred_journal_june_2018/), [GitHub](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/issues) or [#writers_room](https://decred.slack.com/messages/C9HC2NVTM/). Contributions are welcome too, anything from initial collection to final review to translations.

I've been a huge fan of Decred since mid-2016 so almost since the beginning. I was mostly mining until early 2018 when I decided to stack my coins so I managed to buy 4 tickets between May the 2nd and June the 12th thinking I could scrap the staking reward to get some kind of monthly passive income as the average time for a ticket to get picked up is supposed to be 28 days.

But from the look of my tickets maybe there is something wrong with the ticket pool or is this just me and (extreme) bad luck?

Once all DCRs are mined, you have to pay for Miners and Stakers with transaction fees.

That means one of two things:

1. Very high fees = makes the network less attractive to use

2. Big blocks with a lot of transactions and low fees

Ugh. Painful to hear. Everyone in the Decred community shouting the top of their lungs, “amazing that 10% goes to the network fund and then the community can decide how to allocate that capital!” And “holder’s of DCR get to vote and get rewarded! OMG!” I’m here to ask, is that really that amazing? Do holders really care? Everyone praises DCR “autonomous” governance, but it’s not working yet! Let me repeat, it is not working yet. And, imho, the biggest part of it working and being accepted in the future is incredible UX design and UI for Politiea that demonstrates ease of use — we’re talking about iOS apps, Politeia built into wallets, dynamic charts and graphs with voting deadline countdowns, etc. Did you know Facebook has 42 UX designers each getting paid over $200k a year just on the Instagram team? Users demand a great UX for these kinds of products. What’s more is many many holders of Decred don’t want to vote on proposals (even if there is a reward). Most don’t care about the improvements and upgrades, as long as people smarter are making improvements, what does the crowd care? Whatever Jake or the Decred devs propose we will simply accept, because their judgement is far superior to our own — not to mention that have a TON of Decred. 

—&gt; Main point, Politeia UX needs to be off the charts and still, many holders will not care to vote. Give me a Politeia app when I can see proposals in a Twitter-like feed and “heart” them, chat with others interested in making proposals, view dynamic DCR charts like Willy Woo shows us at dcr.farm, and most of all single-click Buy DCR like I can buy BTC on Coinbase. This whole autonomous governance thing is not “revolutionary” — it’s an experiment that demands the highest-level UX in prefer to succeed.

I'm thinking of investing a little deeper in Decred, but there's still something worrying me. Currently contractors (devs, community managers, designers and  marketing guys) are paid monthly (I think) with the the money of community subsidy fund (10% of all pow mining goes to that fund).   


I would like to know if the flows of these payments are DESCRIBED somewhere. After all, I think it's a interest of  everyone's in the community to know exactly how their money is being spent, for whom, why, and how much they're paying for it.

Negative case, how to know that a fund that currently has (equivalent to) tens of millions of dollars and that today is controlled by only one person is not being managed inefficiently, or that funds are not being diverted to personal or third-party enrichment?

recently I discovered Decred and was pretty flabbergasted I hadn't found it earlier, or at least dismissed it at the time. In my opinion it has a pretty perfect system of decentralised development/power, staking coins preventing a sudden (negative) market movement, high security through the hybrid PoW/PoS system and a predictable &amp; transparent coin distribution, which is deflating like Bitcoin.

I immediately started exchanging a significant chunk of my cryptos to decred and I'm thinking of exchanging more shortly.

It might be a strange question in a sub for this coin, but I haven't found many cons for decred yet. Are there any? http://www.coldnuke.com/pros-and-cons.php?pac=37 only shows 2 cons that I think are invalid. The only con I can imagine is that it is yet impossible or at least difficult to stake smaller amounts of decred, making it a bit of an elite coin to participate.

Are there any other known cons that I should know of before I decide to buy more DCR?",NA,"94ivq5",NA,0,NA,"false",1536708174,"false","self","t5_30fo6","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/decred/comments/94ivq5/decred_cons/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

There wasn't previously a section about Decred's governance, so I wrote a [short intro](https://docs.decred.org/governance/governance/) and moved a few other pages to a new governance section. The [Pull Request](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/554) to make these changes was merged recently.

I'm planning to prepare a more general update of the docs site that implements some [jargon updates](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/95r578/proposed_changes_to_decred_jargon/) which have been talked about for a while. As [docs.decred.org](https://docs.decred.org) looks like a kind of official source for the project, I'd rather not change the ""official"" terms without stakeholder approval. So, I am planning to submit a Politeia proposal (or two) about adopting new terms, bundled with a Pull Request that makes those changes on the docs site. This is also intended as a little experiment in governance through the collective approval of document edits, which we will see more of when it's time to amend the constitution and bring it up to date.

I'm curious what people think about this approach or use of Politeia. It's been discussed a bit on Slack and some people are not so keen on what they regard as a more trivial use of Politeia than approving projects and spending project/network fund DCR.

Also, Project/Network fund is the one term change where I don't see a clear preference in the community (although seemingly everyone thinks either one of these is better than dev fund).",NA,"9807gs",NA,0,NA,"false",1536767429,"false","self","t5_30fo6","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/decred/comments/9807gs/new_governance_section_and_politeia_page_on/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

* Whether the current iteration of the platform is ready and fit to start fulfilling a major role in Decred's governance is a subjective call. It makes sense that stakeholders should have to approve it before it is recognized as expressing their will regarding the project fund.
* Could facilitate a smooth launch. Once the switch is flicked people who want to participate would have the length of a voting period (two weeks I think is the current plan) to get their accounts set up and wallets updated for voting. It is inevitable that not everyone will be ready to roll as soon as Politeia goes live. Early activity will determine the first impression that Pi makes and it would be better if this reflects the stakeholder community well.
* A broad proposal like this which is definitely relevant to all stakeholders would help to establish some sort of baseline for Politeia voting rates. Without this, in a scenario where early Politeia proposals are being approved with only 10% or 20% of tickets voting it would be difficult to know how to interpret that, with one possible explanation being that many ticket-holders are not set up for or bought in to Politeia.

The only down-side I see is the delay in getting on with using Politeia properly once it's ready, for a vote on something that is probably a formality. That could be mitigated with a stipulation that if 50% of all live tickets vote Yes before the voting window ends it's game on.",NA,"98lgwt",NA,0,NA,"false",1536777595,"false","self","t5_30fo6","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/decred/comments/98lgwt/preproposal_the_first_politeia_proposalvote/",NA,"","false","","",0,1

## Development

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd): Several steps towards [multipeer downloads](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1145) completed: an [optimization](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1332) to use in-memory block index and a new 1337 [chain view](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1337). Maintenance: improved test coverage, upgrading dependency management system and preparing for the upcoming Go 1.11 release.

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet): A big [change](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1213) introducing optional privacy-preserving SPV sync mode was merged. In this mode dcrwallet does not download the full blockchain but only gets the ""filters"", uses them to determine which blocks it needs and fetches them from random nodes on the network. This has on-disk footprint of 300-400 MB and sync time of minutes, compared to ~3.4 GB and sync time of hours for full sync (these are rough estimates).

&gt; jy-p: the server side of SPV (in dcrd) was deployed in v1.2.0, the client side of SPV (in dcrwallet) is in our next release, v1.3.0. Still some minor bugs in SPV that are being worked out. There will be an update to add the latest features from BIP [157](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0157.mediawiki)/[158](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0158.mediawiki) in the next few months. SPV will be optional in v1.3.0, but it will become the default after we get a proper [header commitment](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/971) for it ([#general](https://riot.im/app/#/room/!MgQoetFiyjrHAywokv:decred.org/$153279679446089MPegE:decred.org))

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton): besides regular bugfixes and design improvements, several components are being developed in parallel like SPV mode, Politeia integration and Trezor support.

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia): [testing](https://twitter.com/marco_peereboom/status/1017185377747169284) started on [mainnet](https://proposals.decred.org/), thanks to everyone who is [participating](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues). A lot of testing, bugfixing and polishing is happening in preparation for full mainnet launch. There are also a few missing features to be added before launch, e.g. capacity to edit a proposal and versioning for that, discussion to remain open once voting starts. Decrediton integration is [moving forward](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1292), check out [this video](https://twitter.com/matheusd_tech/status/1019308870299258880) for a demo and this [meta issue](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/1244) for the full checklist.

Trezor: Decrediton integration of initial Trezor support is [in progress](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1547) and there is a [demo](https://twitter.com/matheusd_tech/status/1019324637954658304).

[Android](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid): app design version 2.0 [completed](https://xd.adobe.com/view/336d6bf4-d220-4388-a795-4012bab46cee).

[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata): development of several chart visualizations was completed and is awaiting deployment. Specifically, [voting agendas](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/523) and [historic charts](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/463) are merged while [ticket pool visualization](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/542) is in testing.

[atomicswap](https://github.com/decred/atomicswap): @glendc is seeking reviews of his Ethereum support [pull request](https://github.com/decred/atomicswap/pull/76).

Dev activity stats for July: 252 active PRs, 220 master commits, 34,754 added and 12,847 deleted lines spread across 6 repositories. Contributions came from 6-10 developers per repository. ([chart](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1025036517683519488))

## Network

Hashrate: the month started at 40.5 and ended at 51.6 PH/s, with a low of 33.3 and a new all time high of 68.4 PH/s. F2Pool is leading with 40-45%, followed by the new BeePool at 15-25% and coinmine.pl at 18-23%.

Staking: 30-day average ticket price is 92.6 DCR (-2.1). The price started the month at 94.6 and quickly retreated to month's low of 85 until 1,860 tickets were bought within a single period (versus target 720). This pushed the pool of tickets to 41,970 (2.5% above target), which in turn caused 10 price increases in a row to the month's high of 100.4. This was the highest ticket price seen on the new ticket price algorithm which has been in effect since Jul 2017. Second half of the month there was unusually low volatility between 92 and 94 DCR per ticket. Locked DCR held between 3.75 and 3.87 million or 46.6-48.0% of supply (+0.1% from previous peak).

Nodes: there are 212 public listening and 216 normal nodes per [dcred.eu](https://dcred.eu/nodeStats). Version distribution: 67% on v1.2.0 (+10%), 24% on v1.1.2 (-1%), 7% on v1.1.0 (-7%). Node count data is not perfect but we can see the steady trend of upgrading to v1.2.0. This version of dcrd is notable for serving compact filters. The increased count of such full nodes allows the developers to test SPV client mode in preparations for the upcoming v1.3.0 release.

## ASICs

Obelisk posted [three updates](https://us16.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=393b2698d17bdfe48ac0422ac&amp;id=87ef82fd96) in July. For the most recent daily updates join their [Discord](https://discord.gg/zt9JznT).

New miner from iBeLink: [DSM7T](https://ibelink.co/product/ibelink-dsm6t-blake256-miner-with-7-th-s-hash-rate/) hashes Blake256 at 7 TH/s or Blake2b at 3.5 TH/s, consumes 2,100 W and costs $3,800, shipping Aug 5-10.

There were also speculations about the mysterious [Pangolin Whatsminer DCR](https://pangolinminer.com/product/whatsminer-dcr/) with the speed of 44 TH/s at 2,200 W and the cost of $3,888, shipping November. If you know more about it please share with us in #pow-mining channel.

## Integrations

Meet new [stake pool](https://decred.org/stakepools/): [dcrpool.ibitlin.com](https://dcrpool.ibitlin.com/) has 1% fees and is hosted by [@life](https://decred.slack.com/team/UB0P8MNDA).

An interesting detail about [decredbrasil.com](https://decredbrasil.com/stats) stake pool was posted in chat:

&gt; emiliomann: stakebrasil is one of the pools with the lowest number of missed and expired tickets. It was one of the first and has a smaller percentage than the most recent ones who haven’t had the time to do so. (...) The Brazilian pool should be the one with the more servers spread around the world: 6 to decrease the latency. This is to explain to you why the \[pool fee\] rate of 5% (currently around 0.06 DCR) on the reward is also one of the highest.  
&gt; girino: 8 voting wallets now. I just finished setting up a new one yesterday. All of them in different datacenters, 3 in europe, 3 in north america, 1 in brazil and one in asia. We also have 3 more servers, 1 for the front end, one for ""stats"" and one for dcrdata. ([#general](https://riot.im/app/#/room/!MgQoetFiyjrHAywokv:decred.org/$153166757139590QIHHB:decred.org))

On the mining side, Luxor [started](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8xptci/luxor_tech_chinese_pools/) a new set of pool servers inside mainland China, while [zpool](https://www.zpool.ca/) has [enabled](https://twitter.com/_zpool_/status/1020751950327922689) Decred mining.

StatX [announced](https://twitter.com/statxapp/status/1021498097921388544) Decred integration into their [live dashboard](https://www.ccn.com/statx-takes-on-telegram-with-unique-mobile-app-for-the-crypto/) and public chat.

Decred was [added](https://twitter.com/SatoWallet/status/1022103042160832512) to Satowallet with BTC and ETH trading pairs. Caution: do your best to understand the security model before using any wallet software.

## Adoption

VotoLegal update:

&gt; Marina Silva is the first presidential candidate in Brazil using blockchain to keep all their electoral donations transparent and traceable. VotoLegal uses Decred technology, awesome use case! ([reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8znzaq/votolegal_first_presidential_candidate_in_brazil/))

The story was covered by [criptonoticias.com](https://www.criptonoticias.com/votaciones/candidata-presidencial-brasil-recaudara-fondos-campana-usando-blockchain-decred/) ([translated](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;u=https://www.criptonoticias.com/votaciones/candidata-presidencial-brasil-recaudara-fondos-campana-usando-blockchain-decred/)) and [livecoins.com.br](https://livecoins.com.br/marina-silva-utilizando-blockchain-da-decred-para-deixar-transparente-o-financiamento-coletivo-de-sua-campanha-eleitoral/) ([translated](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;u=https://livecoins.com.br/marina-silva-utilizando-blockchain-da-decred-para-deixar-transparente-o-financiamento-coletivo-de-sua-campanha-eleitoral/)), the latter received hundreds of upvotes and comments [on r/brasil](https://www.reddit.com/r/brasil/comments/8zv52w/marina_silva_utilizando_blockchain_da_decred_para/).

On the OTC trading front, @i2Rav from [i2trading](https://i2trading.com/) reports:

&gt; We continue to see institutional interest in DCR. Large block buyers love the concept of staking as a way to earn additional income and appreciate the stakeholder rights it affords them. Likening a DCR investment to an activist shareholder/bondholder gives these institutions some comfort while dipping their toes into a burgeoning new asset class.

## Marketing

Targeted advertising reports released for [June](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8xgrv4/monthly_targeted_ads_report/) and [July](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/95eqno/july_monthly_advertising_reports/). As usual, reach @timhebel for full versions.

&gt; Big news in June: Facebook reversed their policy on banning crypto ads. ICO ads are still banned, but we should be OK. My team filled out the appeal today, so we should hopefully hear something within a few days. (u/timhebel on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8xgrv4/monthly_targeted_ads_report/))

After couple weeks Facebook finally responded to the appeal and the next step is to verify the domain name via DNS.

A pack of Stakey Telegram stickers is now [available](https://twitter.com/dcrstakey/status/1021894556978163712). Have fun!

## Markets

In July DCR was trading in USD 56-76 and BTC 0.0072-0.0109 range. A recovery started after a volume boost of up to $10.5 m on Fex around Jul 13, but once Bitcoin headed towards USD ~8,000 DCR declined along with most altcoins.

However, be aware that running pre-release software may require a downgrade and/or redownload of the chain in extreme cases

--- 
This release candidate of dcrd contains significant performance enhancements for startup
speed, validation, and network operations that directly benefit lightweight
clients, such as SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) wallets, a policy change
to reduce the default minimum transaction fee rate, a new public test network
version, removal of bloom filter support, infrastructure improvements, and other
quality assurance changes.

## Downgrade Warning

The database format in v1.3.0 is not compatible with previous versions of the
software.  This only affects downgrades as users upgrading from previous
versions will see a one time database migration.

Once this migration has been completed, it will no longer be possible to
downgrade to a previous version of the software without having to delete the
database and redownload the chain.

## Notable Changes

### Reduction of Default Minimum Transaction Fee Rate Policy

The default setting for the policy which specifies the minimum transaction fee
rate that will be accepted and relayed to the rest of the network has been
reduced to 0.0001 DCR/kB (10,000 atoms/kB) from the previous value of 0.001
DCR/kB (100,000 atoms/kB).

Transactions should not attempt to use the reduced fee rate until the majority
of the network has upgraded to this release as otherwise the transactions will
likely have issues relaying through the network since old nodes that have not
updated their policy will reject them due to not paying a high enough fee.

### Several Speed Optimizations

This release contains several enhancements to improve speed for startup,
the initial sync process, validation, and network operations.

In order to achieve these speedups, there is a one time database migration, as
previously mentioned, that typically only takes a few seconds to complete on
most hardware.

### Further Improved Startup Speed

The startup time has been improved by roughly 2x on both slower hard disk drives
(HDDs) and solid state drives (SSDs) as compared to v1.2.0.

### Significantly Faster Network Operations

The ability to serve information to other peers on the network has received
several optimizations which, in addition to generally improving the overall
scalability and throughput of the network, also directly benefits SPV
(Simplified Payment Verification) clients by delivering the block headers they
require roughly 3x to 4x faster.

### Signature Hash Calculation Optimization

Part of validating that transactions are only spending coins that the owner has
authorized involves ensuring the validity of cryptographic signatures.  This
release provides a speedup of about 75% to a key portion of that validation
which results in a roughly 20% faster initial sync process.

### Bloom Filters Removal

Bloom filters were deprecated as of the last release in favor of the more recent
privacy-preserving GCS committed filters.  Consequently, this release removes
support for bloom filters completely.  There are no known clients which use
bloom filters, however, if there are any unknown clients which use them, those
clients will need to be updated to use the GCS committed filters accordingly.

### Public Test Network Version 3

The public test network has been reset and bumped to version 3.  All of the new
consensus rules voted in by version 2 of the public test network have been
retained and are therefore active on the new version 3 test network without
having to vote them in again.

1. Is there any way to tell which of the developer listed on the homepage are working for Company or are independent?  

2. [https://github.com/decred/dcrd/graphs/contributors](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/graphs/contributors)  
While looking through Gitbhub I noticed that just a handful of people are really contributing actively. Not more than 10.

Some of these concepts were copied from other projects, some of them were intentionally made up and others just started existing. Now, in order to make the Decred project more accessible to newcomers, we need to simplify some of these concepts. 

###Propose changes

The idea behind this thread is to let everyone propose changes to the Decred jargon and introduce new concepts that are easier to understand. If you add a comment, please indicate clearly which word you'd like to see changed, briefly explain why, and introduce a new concept that could potentially replace it.

To all lurkers: feel free to add feedback to the proposed changes in the comment section and don't forget to upvote the best proposals.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Hear stakeholders &amp; newcomers to improve governance in terms of social felling, like news, ideias, suggetions, potentials proposals to the future and put this inside Politeia (filter 0-5 stars to each post)

\- The Inverse of today: Allow sharing it on popular social media (twitter, facebook, etc.)

\- No advertising and sponsors (Fast to spread &amp; more focus).

\- Don't lose information mixed with others contents.

\- To transform all the content in notifications to real followers of the project.

\- People can publish in all the languages, not just in english (filters for each one).

\- Decentralize information (not centralize it on medias that make money with a lot sponsors)

\- Independent media (today many accounts &amp; medias are in power hands, they publish only if you paying)

\- Easy to manage (volunteer moderators with a good score)

\- Is public for the commnunity members add value in all content like the bright Decred Development.

\- Open Source

I am a student at UCT (University of Cape Town) currently in my honours year studying pure mathematics. I have been following bitcoin since 2013 and I have been enthusiastic about decred ever since I discovered it last year. I am very excited about the future prospects of decred, especially the idea of having a decentralized network fund for stakeholders to fund projects by using on-chain voting. I understand that Politeia is not live yet, but I would like to share my proposal as the academic year is nearing its last quarter.

**Proposal:**

I am in the process of getting branded hoodies for my fellow classmates studying toward their pure and applied mathematics honours. I am writing this proposal to ask for a subsidy toward the cost of the hoodie. If the proposal moves forward, I will use the updated rear hoodie design which contains a large decred logo. (See proposed designs below) 

**Payment:**

I would be looking for around 300-350USD. The amount is not yet final as it is dependent on the number of hoodies ordered. If things progress further with this proposal, I would be clear about the final amount as well as all of its constituent costs. I would be grateful to receive funding from the DHG or any generous community members. Payment can be made in arrears, preferably with the funds held by well-known a community member(s). Conditions of sufficient evidence of project completion should be agreed on beforehand to avoid conflict.

**Benefits:**

Students from universities across the world, like the students from the University of Cape Town, are becoming interested in cryptocurrencies. (See relevant links) Having a Decred logo on a university hoodie will ignite organic growth and interest in the Decred Project from various students across the University, as well as anywhere else they may wear their branded apparel. The present logo could be a starting point to hold discussions about Decred and cryptocurrencies as a whole.

**Further notes:**

I would be happy to verify my identity with any relevant persons beforehand. I am also happy to provide all figures and relevant details w.r.t. the costs and supplier.

**Updated Hoodie Design w/ placed Decred logo:**

Here are some preliminary designs of the hoodie with a decred logo on the rear side of the hoodie. I am open to any suggestions about how the design could be changed.

It seems they're pretending to be the manufacture of whatsminer. And they have abused on the logo and brandname of microbt.

3. Evidence 2

And even their video is stealing from us....

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39LtJiFa8o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39LtJiFa8o)

Please check the bottom right corner.... They do not have the source file, and just copy and re-edit things and post on their website.

You can find below for the first whatsminer M10 video shooting scenario.

4. Abuse of microbt's Logo

[whatsminer.net](https://whatsminer.net/) is also abusing on the logo registered by microbt.

In this case, [whatsminer.net](https://whatsminer.net/) can be also treated as counterfeit.

We won't encourage people to trust a company (or a person) who even abuse on logo.

5. Conclusion

But, people are still talking about how ETH will start a bullrun, XLM, Monero, and the like. DCR remains the underdog.

# Development

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd): Version 1.3.0 RC1 (Release Candidate 1) is out! The main features of this release are significant performance improvements, including some that benefit SPV clients. Full release notes and downloads are [on GitHub](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.3.0-rc1).

The default minimum transaction fee rate was reduced from 0.001 to 0.0001 DCR/kB. Do not try to send such small fee transactions just yet, until the majority of the network upgrades.

Release process was [changed](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1414) to use release branches and bump version on the master branch at the beginning of a release cycle. Discussed in [this chat](https://riot.im/app/#/room/!HEeJkbPRpAqgAwhXWO:decred.org/$153487143956936pmKTp:decred.org).

The codebase is ready for the new Go 1.11 version. Migration to vgo module system is complete and the 1.4.0 release will be built using modules. The list of versioned modules and a hierarchy diagram are available [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/README.md#GoModules).

The testnet was reset and bumped to version 3.

Comments are welcome for the [proposal](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1412) to implement smart fee estimation, which is important for Lightning Network.

@matheusd recorded a code review [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eysGWVhDFWY) for new Decred developers that explains how tickets are selected for voting.

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet): Version [1.3.0 RC1](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.3.0-rc1) features new SPV sync mode, new ticket buyer, new APIs for Decrediton and a host of bug fixes. On the dev side, dcrwallet also [migrated](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1238) to the new module system.

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton): Version [1.3.0 RC1](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.3.0-rc1) adds the new SPV sync mode that syncs roughly 5x faster. The feature is off by default while it receives more testing from experienced users. Other notable changes include a design polish and experimental Politeia integration.

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia): Proposal editing is [being developed](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/515) and has a [short demo](https://twitter.com/marco_peereboom/status/1032753235927425024). This will allow proposal owners to edit their proposal in response to community feedback before voting begins. The challenges associated with this feature relate to updating censorship tokens and maintaining a clear history of which version comments were made  on. @fernandoabolafio produced this [architecture diagram](https://twitter.com/oxfernando/status/1033390103534751746) which may be of interest to developers.

@degeri joined to perform security testing of Politeia and found [several issues](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3Adegeri).

[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata): mainnet explorer upgraded to v2.1 with several new features. For users: credit/debit tx filter on address page, showing miner fees on coinbase transaction page, estimate yearly ticket rewards on [main page](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/), cool new hamburger menu and keyboard navigation. For developers: new [chain parameters](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/parameters) page, experimental Insight API support, endpoints for coin supply and block rewards, testnet3 support. Lots of minor API changes and frontend tweaks, many bug fixes and robustness improvements.

The upcoming v3.0 entered beta and is deployed on [beta.dcrdata.org](https://beta.dcrdata.org/). Check out the new [charts](https://beta.dcrdata.org/charts) page. Feedback and bug reports are appreciated. Finally, the development version v3.1.0-pre is on [alpha.dcrdata.org](https://alpha.dcrdata.org/).

[Android](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid): updated to be compatible with the latest SPV code and is syncing, several performance issues are worked on. Details were posted [in chat](https://riot.im/app/#/room/!HEeJkbPRpAqgAwhXWO:decred.org/$153332352649099xKBlX:decred.org). Alpha testing has started, to participate please join [#dev](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#dev:decred.org) and ask for the APK.

[iOS](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios): backend is mostly complete, as well as the front end. Support for devices with smaller screens was improved. What works now: creating and recovering wallets, listing of transactions, receiving DCR, displaying and scanning QR codes, browsing account information, SPV connection to peers, downloading headers. Some bugs need fixing before making testable builds.

[Ticket splitting](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher): v0.6.0 beta [released](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher/releases/tag/v0.6.0) with improved fee calculation and multiple bug fixes.

[docs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs): [introduced](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9807gs/new_governance_section_and_politeia_page_on/) new [Governance](https://docs.decred.org/governance/governance/) section that grouped some old articles as well as the new [Politeia](https://docs.decred.org/governance/politeia/) page.

@Richard-Red created a [concept repository](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/governance-docs) sandbox with policy documents, to illustrate the kind of policies that could be approved and amended by Politeia proposals.

[decred.org](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb): 8 [contributors](https://decred.org/contributors/) added and 4 removed, including 2 advisors (discussion [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/issues/316)).

[decredmarketcap.com](https://decredmarketcap.com/) is a brand new website that shows the most accurate DCR market data. Clean design, mobile friendly, no javascript required.

Dev activity stats for August: 239 active PRs, 219 commits, 25k added and 11k deleted lines spread across 8 repositories. Contributions came from 2-10 developers per repository. ([chart](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1037718562842927104))

# ASICs

Obelisk posted 3 [email updates](https://us16.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=393b2698d17bdfe48ac0422ac&amp;id=87ef82fd96) in August. DCR1 units are [reportedly](https://us16.campaign-archive.com/?u=393b2698d17bdfe48ac0422ac&amp;id=43645f11f8) shipping with 1 TH/s hashrate and will be upgraded with firmware to 1.5 TH/s. Batch 1 customers will receive [compensation](https://us16.campaign-archive.com/?u=393b2698d17bdfe48ac0422ac&amp;id=17e8f9480f) for missed shipment dates, but only after Batch 5 ships. Batch 2-5 customers will be receiving the updated [slim design](https://twitter.com/ObeliskTechHQ/status/1034548178056560641).

Innosilicon [announced](https://twitter.com/Inno_Miner/status/1025189797239771136) the new [D9+ DecredMaster](http://www.innosilicon.com/html/d9+-miner/index.html): 2.8 TH/s at 1,230 W priced $1,499. Specified shipping date was Aug 10-15.

[FFMiner DS19](https://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/ffminer/ds19) claims 3.1 TH/s for Blake256R14 at 680 W and simultaneously 1.55 TH/s for Blake2B at 410 W, the price is [$1,299](https://www.akminer.com/all-products/new-double-mode-dcr-sc-asic-ds19-shipment-20-25th-aug). Shipping Aug 20-25.

Another newly noticed miner offer is [this](https://signatureit.org/products/decred-dcr-blake256r14-asic-46th-s-2200w-estimated-roi-6-months-30-day-after-electricity) unit that does 46 TH/s at 2,150 W at the price of $4,720. It is shipping Nov 2018 and the stats look very close to [Pangolin Whatsminer DCR](https://pangolinminer.com/product/whatsminer-dcr/) (which has now a page on [asicminervalue](https://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/pangolin/whatsminer-dcr)).

# Integrations

Comm systems news:

* Interruptions in the chat bridge led to some Slack messages not reaching other platforms, and consequently not being archived in Matrix.
* Several impersonators were detected and banned.
* Inactive Slack channels were archived. If you miss them, let it be known.
* [Mastodon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_%28software%29) was mentioned by several people as a possible alternative for Twitter.
* Two new Reddit [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/about/rules/) were added to prevent CAPS flood and duplicate submissions.

After another debate about chat systems more people began testing and using Matrix, leading to some gardening on that platform:

* Decred Matrix community was created: [+decred:decred.org](https://matrix.to/#/+decred:decred.org), it helps to see all Decred-related rooms and people.
* [#privacy](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#privacy:decred.org) and [#design](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#design:decred.org) are now bridged.
* One private work channel was successfully migrated to Matrix.
* Stylish room avatars were set.
* @Haon has prepared a short [guide](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DmXNuV7W4AsLEmH.jpg:large) to help new Matrix users get started and join the Decred rooms.

Highlights:

* A [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/95r578/proposed_changes_to_decred_jargon/) was started to discuss changes to Decred jargon with the intent to make it more consistent and accessible to newcomers. The question whether changing ""official"" terminology requires stakeholder approval was touched in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9807gs/new_governance_section_and_politeia_page_on/) and in [#documentation](https://riot.im/app/#/room/!tfqymymiNgzSUJTHqS:decred.org/$1535386492135ZGULG:decred.org).
* Project fund transparency and constitution were extensively discussed on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/96j9ai/transparency_in_payments_made_with_the_community/) and in [#general](https://riot.im/app/#/room/!MgQoetFiyjrHAywokv:decred.org/$153410896753432nExMw:decred.org).
* [Pre-proposal](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/98lgwt/preproposal_the_first_politeia_proposalvote/) to use Politeia to approve Politeia as a legitimate decision-making tool for Decred.

# Markets

DCR started the month at USD 56 / BTC 0.0073 and had a two week decline. On Aug 14 the whole market took a [huge drop](https://archive.today/K5buy) and briefly went below USD 200 billion. Bitcoin went below USD 6,000 and top 100 cryptos lost 5-30%. The lowest point coincided with Bitcoin dominance peak at 54.5%. On that day Decred dived -17% and reached the bottom of USD 32 / BTC 0.00537. Since then it went sideways in the USD 35-45 / BTC 0.0054-0.0064 range. Around Aug 24, Huobi showed DCR trading volume above USD 5M and this coincided with a minor recovery.

StopAndDecrypt [published](https://hackernoon.com/asic-resistance-is-nothing-but-a-blockchain-buzzword-b91d3d770366) an extensive article ""ASIC Resistance is Nothing but a Blockchain Buzzword"" that is much in line with Decred's stance on ASICs.

The ongoing [debates](https://www.reddit.com/r/siacoin/comments/990ga9/siacoin_obelisk_fork_is_no_better_than_ethereum/) about the possible Sia [fork](https://www.reddit.com/r/siacoin/comments/94ji0q/a_community_proposal_to_resolve_the_obelisk/) yet again demonstrate the importance of a robust dispute resolution mechanism. Also, we are [lucky](https://www.reddit.com/r/siacoin/comments/956k6g/community_fork_proposal_detail_discussion_dev_fee/) to have the treasury.

Mark B Lundeberg, who [found](https://github.com/decred/atomicswap/issues/58) a vulnerability in atomicswap earlier, [published](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8yp6gd/my_newest_a_way_to_perform_p2p_atomic_swaps/) a concept of more private peer-to-peer atomic swaps. (missed in July issue)

Medium took a [cautious stance](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000646167-Cryptocurrencies-on-Medium) on cryptocurrencies and triggered at least one project to [migrate](https://blog.aragon.org/aragon-against-censorship-goodbye-medium-hello-ghost/) to Ghost (that same project previously [migrated](https://blog.aragon.org/announcing-our-migration-to-an-open-source-messaging-platform-420b25e74284/) away from Slack).

Regulation: Vietnam [bans](https://icobrothers.media/2018/08/14/vietnamese-authorities-have-officially-banned-mining-equipment-import/) mining equipment imports, China [halts](https://www.asiacryptotoday.com/china-halts-hosting-of-crypto-events-in-beijing-bans-crypto-news-accounts-on-wechat/) crypto events and tightens control of crypto chat groups.

Reddit [was hacked](https://www.wired.com/story/reddit-hacked-thanks-to-woefully-insecure-two-factor-setup/) by intercepting 2FA codes sent via SMS. The [announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/93qnm5/we_had_a_security_incident_heres_what_you_need_to/) explains the impact. Yet another [data breach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_breaches) suggests to think twice before sharing any data with any company and shift to more secure authentication systems.

Intel and x86 dumpsterfire keeps [burning brighter](https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&amp;m=153504937925732&amp;w=2). Seek more secure hardware and operating systems for your coins.

However I am very hesitant to use the currency directly on large purchases because the irreversible nature of the system does not afford me any protection as the buyer, should the seller not make good.

I only use crypto payments from known sellers where I’m very sure they won’t fuck me over and fiat means for all others. However, Bitcoin and Decred are meant to be used with escrow. Satoshi writes it himself on page 1 of the whitepaper: ""Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers."" Whats currently missing are the easy implemented escrow mechanisms. I’m sure that I am not the only one who hesitates on large cost transactions and opts for the buyers protection afforded by traditional means.

Are there any plans in the works that I am unaware of that seek to address this concern?",NA,"9fkhzg",NA,0,NA,"false",1540118639,"false","self","t5_30fo6",NA,"serene3","","false","true",NA,"/r/decred/comments/9fkhzg/planned_implimtations_of_buyer_protections_in_the/",NA,"","false","Discussion","",0,0

https://beanstalkwebsolutions.com/reports/2018-aug/Decred%20Digital%20Marketing%20Report-%20July-Aug%202018%20Redacted-176541.pdf

Summary:
https://beanstalkwebsolutions.com/reports/2018-aug/Decred%20Digital%20Marketing%20Report_Summarized_-%20July-Aug%202018-128675.pdf

Facebook- Verification of appeal to advertise is still pending.

Google- Search Ads for cryptocurrency were banned as of 7/26. Decred display ads in Campaign C mentioning 'roadmap' were paused, and a couple mentioned 'cryptocurrency' have been disapproved due to the crypto policy. We are holding off on making any new ads to avoid triggering a total disapproval for as long as possible. Campaign D (Youtube) placements have been tightened up as of 8/22 to exclude many sites that are not crypto-related.

Twitter- On 7/26, a fifth Campaign was added to take advantage of a new video ad type - in-stream video ads - which play before other videos on Twitter. Ads in Campaigns A-C ads were reviewed and irrelevant ads discussing 'roadmap' and 'lightning network' were paused. All Campaigns A-E were updated to targed only English-speakers in the U.S. who are already interested in cryptocurrency. A sixth Campaign was added 9/4 to appeal to English and regional language speakers who are already interested in crypto, and it will use 25% of the Twitter budget.

PM me in Slack if you would like a copy of the full, non-redacted report.

Until next month!

Why would a ticket not vote within this window?

Will my ticket only be unlocked after 142 - 144 days or could it unlocked sooner?

Waiting for Decreds to be unlocked from a ticket for 28 days or 144 days is quite a difference. Do i have any control over when they will be unlocked? 

or at the very least know when they would be unlocked?

How do i proceed to unlock my decreds that are now stuck in a ticket that did no vote within the 28 days window?

Thank you,
CryptoBloq
