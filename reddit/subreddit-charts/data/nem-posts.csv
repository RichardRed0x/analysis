I’m part of a small team that helped develop CoinAlarm, an app for tracking prices and receiving real-time price alerts (along with so much more!) for ALL CRYPTOCURRENCIES currently in the market. 

Whatever exchange you use, whatever coin you invest in, you can track prices through our app or widget, and be alerted when the price or volume reaches a certain target price/volume that you can set.
CoinAlarm also provides market depth and arbitrage opportunities between exchanges, so that users can make the smartest decisions. You can also use the spam-free chatroom provided in our app, to share information on price changes and market situations.


CoinAlarm is currently available in 7 languages (English, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Portuguese) and is completely free, and there are no ads to disturb you in any way. 
Here's a link to the google play store: (our iOS version has some language issues, and needs an update: 
https://ref.ad-brix.com/v1/referrallink?ak=826337351&amp;ck=2838517&amp;sub_referral=6289888

We’re all working hard to improve our app (an update where we provide charts and more languages is in the works!), and all we ask is you leave us your feedback when you give our app a try :D

Where is NEM going?  Are there any upcoming conferences the dev team is speaking at, what partnerships have they made?

What is a good initial position in XEM?  Obviously, this will be a long term hold for me (2-5 years), so by the time I decide to exit it will be worth either nothing or an incredible amount more.

Cuz frankly for me, the one thing that is holding me back from being a total Nem-fanboy is it's non transparent relationship with the banks and corporations. The interviews I found with Lon Wong did not convince me either that Nem is on the philosophically right track.

Here is Homes23 comment: 
""So as you say Mijin is being used on the enterprise level. Enterprises using Mijin, are they paying any network fees? Are those fees paid in XEM? Can this XEM be earned by harvesting? If not who is earning the fees? NEM foundation is non for profit organization, how about Tech Bureau, Corp which owns Mijin? Is Catapult being developed by NEM foundation or Tech Bureau, Corp.? I see NEM/Mijins's blockchain technology to be superior compared to most of the competition. But I'm confused, as all the banks, enterprises, governments and whoever else will obviously use Mijin over NEM. They can't have their records on a public blockchain. So what is the purpose of NEM and how it will grow in value ?""

It was the first time that blockchain “shares” were traded. Recently another currency was created:DIM (Data Interchange Module).

There are two versions of DIM: DIMCOIN and DIM Currency. DIMCOIN is a speculative coin that can be traded with other digital currencies.DIM Currency is a digital currency which is linked to a particular equivalent of fiat money. Furthermore only DIM Currency is valid as a means of payment in the realm of the DIM ecosystem.

The DIM ecosystem offers many services: digitisation of capital, trade with digital shares and property asset, digital exchange of currency, exchange of digital currency for fiat money, e-commerce, purchases with debit cards, commercial business and trade of commodities. All services are available for mobile and desktop. DIM and the DIM ecosystem are organised by the DIM Foundation and are based on on the NEM-blockchain-technology. This technology offers an unique two-sided interpretation with junction-reputation, spam-protection and time synchronisation by dint of so-called ""super-junction"" - to guarantee a safe online trade and safe online transaction.

The access to the DIM ecosystem is provided by a personal DEPOTWALLET also  from the DIMCOIN Foundation. As meeting inside the DIM Ecosystem for DIM (DIMCOIN and DIM Currencies) is WISE Consulting. The Hybrid Stock Exchange (HYBSE) is an online platform for global companies and investors that offers a rash of digital property assets like shares, ETCs(Exchange-Traded Commodities), ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds), ETNs (Exchange-Traded Notes), Crypto-Forex Exchange, Index, Startups-IPO, Startup-ICO and Pirate Market.

Why Dimcoin? Here are the advantages: You can buy and sell stocks without a broker. By this you save on commissions and bank fees when buying and selling digital assets. Furthermore you will get total control over your property. You hold your own property and can resist against garnishment. Only you can access your assets and no third party is involved.. Your ""buy"" and ""sell"" orders get executed in real-time on the blockchain. It’s a decentralised network that is always accessible 24/7 ). Service is included.

The exemplary board of directors and advisors provide their vast knowledge of finance, policy and regulation to managing and advising DIMCOIN. The experienced team lend their understanding and ability in technology, financial services and compliance to developing and maintaining DIMCOIN. The investors include globally recognised venture capital firms and strategic investors.

After investing with some of the most common cryptocurrencies you will receive an email within 10 days with instructions on how to receive your DIMCOIN / DIM TOKEN. You will need to download NEMs NanoWallet or DIMCOINs Depotwallet. Depotwallet is a blockchain wallet that permits users to buy, sell, manage and hold DIM cryptocurrencies and cryptonised assets. The wallet is free to download on the DIMCOIN, HYBSE and Depotwallet websites.

The DIM Foundation is responsible for the management, creation and distribution of both the DIMCOIN and DIM Currencies. The price of DIMCOIN is determined by market forces and also influenced by developments within the DIM ecosystem. You can trade and convert DIMCOIN to DIM Currencies, then you will be able to buy cryptonised assets in the DIM ecosystem. Through Depotwallet debit cards users can perform online and walk-in merchant shopping. Anyone with a Depotwallet account can send and accept DIMCOIN. You can find all the crypto-equities on HYBSE.com, and you can purchase them through the Depotwallet (currently in beta phase).

How To Register a Depotwallet:

Visit: https://depotwallet.com/
Open Account
Wallet name and Password and Create an account
Save the “.wlt” file in a secure location
Open text document
Copy and paste the raw wallet file and private keys on a text document
Check the boxes andagree!


Difference between DIMCOIN and DIM TOKEN: The DIM TOKEN is something that is only available during the Pre-ICO and ICO period. Buying 50+ DIM TOKEN qualifies the user to receive a share of total 30% of the net transfer fees from the DIM Ecosystem. DIMCOIN is a speculative coin which is used for investing and within the DIM Ecosystem.

How do you invest?

You need to have a cryptocurrency wallet in order to purchase DIMCOIN, and you need to create a Depotwallet / NanoWallet in order to receive DIMCOIN. You can invest from the DIMCOIN website by following the instructions provided there. Invest with XEM and receive an additional 10% Bonus (depending on the time of your investment - check the website to get the last rate).

Why should you invest?

The current global stock markets are electronic in nature. In general, all electronic matching systems are quicker than the open outcry system of the past. However, it is still not quick enough for our ever-changing world. After orders are matched, it can take days for them to be executed. It is burdensome and expensive to buy assets such as shares from foreign markets using traditional methods such as banks and stock markets. Transferring shares between issuers and investors using current banking systems is archaic and lethargic at best. It can take from two days to six months before both parties are in possession of their assets.

What does this token represent?

1 DIM Token will be equivalent to 100 DIMCOIN, each DIMCOIN is worth $0.01. The tokens represent a form of ownership of the DIM Ecosystem. Payout structure: Investors with +50 DIM Tokens will receive a share from 30% of the net fees earned on the DIM cryptocurrency transfers within the DIM ecosystem according to the percentage of tokens owned. Bonuses: Grid is constructed with regards to amount raised.

Be clever - invest in DIM and use cryptocurrency! The DIM is a digital cryptocurrency which comes in two versions, the DIMCOIN and DIM Currencies. DIM Currencies are a digital currency for the DIM-ecosystem e-commerce and merchant purchasing.

ICO started – the way to success:

This year DIMCOIN will enlist in 3 major exchanges, reprogram HYBSE into a blockchain platform and launch an application on Android. Have 50 companies listed on HYBSE.

In 2018 is the implementation of HYBSE on blockchain, launch mobile phone trading for Android and have DIM Currencies accepted for commercial purposes. Expand operations into Asia.

2019: Have 1% share of the global trading done on DIM ecosystem, list ecosystem on global stock markets and implement DIM ATMs. Expand operations to South America.

2020: List the DIM ecosystem on global stock markets. Expand operations into Africa.

DIMCOINS - the best kind of digital currency!

I have been reading allot about blockchain in general and starting to understand the difference between POW vs POS vs POI but there are so so much more to learn. 
Right now i'm not able to find enough information to grasp the harvesting and also the wallet importance part which is a big part of XEM (if i'm not mistaken). 
I saw the interview with the Lon Wong where he mentions that the idea with NEM is that people must use it to create value and increase the importance for the wallet.  Also i watched another interview mentioning harvesting....

So basically i have now 10158 XEM which qualify me for harvesting (i'm already vesting). 
For me i'm more into long term investing and hoping for gain. I'm all in for passive income but i can not of course effort 3milj XEM for supernode. 

Can someone please explain to me
1) what does harvesting do exactly? (i believe several people join a supernode and share the reward based on their investment but not sure if that is true?)
2) NEM wants people to use the token but when they go up in value how is that feasible? 
3) What is the point of wallet importance exactly? i see it even in my nem wallet on the PC. I have no use for sending and receiving NEM to anyone so how am i affected?
4) IS NEM a good long term investment? Just for harvesting and hodling?

Sorry if these questions have been asked many times before but i dont seem to be able to find a straight answer to them so i would greatly appreciate your help with my questions.",NA,"6rbiad",NA,0,NA,"false",1504638500,"false","self","t5_2zxmv","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/nem/comments/6rbiad/harvesting_and_wallet_importance/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

How does PoI compare to PoS and Pow? 
Wouldn't that lead to the same problem as in the other proofs, where having a lot of of the currency or a lot of capital to begin with just makes you richer without having much to do?

Once the total monetary mass is attained, how does harvesting work then? There isn't any monetary creation left? 
Isn't it very similar to PoS where you just have to let money sitting on your account to be considered ""important""?

Coinbase, Bitfinex and Kraken takes USD/EUR deposits but they don't trade nem. Bittrex and Poloniex trade nem in high volume but don't take USD/EUR deposits. So in order to buy nem you'd probably have to deposit money to either Coinbase, Bitfinex or Kraken, buy BTC, transfer the BTC over to another exchange and then buy your nem. So as a new user you'd have to sign up to two exchanges in order to get your hands on some nem. Unless I've missed something this definitely adds a barrier for adoption and is not something we want. Is there anything that can be done? Is there anyone from the nem team here or can we notify them of this problem?

**Update1:** I've been suggested https://changelly.com but the EUR/USD conversion rates are currently *very* unfavorable. It seems that if you want to use changelly you will still have to buy LTC, BTC or ETH somewhere else first and transfer it over. So the problem of two exchanges to buy XEM still persists. There should definitely be a better and easier way to buy XEM with EUR/USD.

**Update2:** I've been suggested https://www.litebit.eu/ and there is also https://hitbtc.com/. They might work but I have no experience with either and to be honest they look to be somewhat small exchanges. If someone wants to purchase a large amount of XEM I suspect it might be difficult there.",NA,"6sl7pm",NA,0,NA,"false",1504661680,"false","self","t5_2zxmv","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/nem/comments/6sl7pm/nem_adoption_problem_identified_buying_xem_with/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

I've been studying NEM a bit and want to make sure I have this right.

The way I see it :

* NEM is a technically superior (in terms of speed, transactions etc) public blockchain  with some nice features (multisig, notarization, mosaics,..) 

* The native token is XEM

* To use all the features of the public blockchain, XEM is required.

* As more people use the features, the usage of XEM increases and thus the price.

* Mijin is a version of the NEM ledger, made and sold as private blockchains by the company Tech Bureau, not to be confused with the Nem Foundation.

* Businesses using Mijin do not need to buy XEM

* Catapult is basically the evolution of Mijin, also made and sold by Tech Bureau.

* The difference between catapult and mijin appears to be that catapult is made to interact with the public chain too, which does require XEM tokens.

So, the value (and increase thereof) of our purchase, the XEM token, appears to be derived from increased usage as a currency by the general public and usage by catapult users IF they choose to interact with the public chain.

So, why would they do that? The only thing I have is wanting to interact with other private chains of theirs. Will there be features that will only exist on the public chain, not available in catapult ?

I can see the public using more, because of the features (esp multisig) if and when it will be easier (wallets and fiat ramps) but I don't see that much usage from companies.

Also, what is Cora (there are references to it but i don't see the link with NEM) ?

And finally, any news on the release of catapult?",NA,"6ssgov",NA,0,NA,"false",1504665279,"false","self","t5_2zxmv","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/nem/comments/6ssgov/value_proposition_of_xem/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

Topics were diverse: from the introduction to NEM, through consensus algorithms implemented in cryptocurrencies, to some technical topics. Attendees participated in the process of creating multisignature accounts, namespaces, mosaics and apostilles in the NanoWallet. After the presentation, there was plenty of questions about those features in the NEM blockchain, and the most active attendees received NEM’s T-shirts.

**ME**: Hi Mr Wong, Big fan of the project here! 

If you don’t mind. I’d like to share a piece of advice on something the community is mostly concerned about..

    Would you please let us know about the marketing strategy for the rest of the year? Many of the investors, including myself,  are highly concerned that despite the tech is ahead most of their competitors there's no focus at all in making an assertive effort to catch the investors target who are not as tech savvy.  I believe the current market cap NEM got is because of the people who read and understood what is shown at the current website, tech papers, community forums and youtube videos  . Which in my case, even as an IT consultant with 10+ years took a while to appreciate and fully embrace! I had to visit the website many times until it got me convinced to invest..

 In my opinion this current situation could be a problem because the project will loose traction if NEM doesn't get more spotlights, the competition is fierce and they are defintitively using agencies to promote and advertise: Take for example NEO, which I know if way far inferior than NEM but, with the proper marketing strategy, which included a  deep overhaul of their website, name, and a new logo, made it gain around 400%+ in value within a week!. Image what would happen if NEM focus just enough to pull out something similar! I'm aware there's a new website coming up and I hope it's quality can compete with the others (NEO,IOTA,WAVES..)

 Other stuff need urgent attention, for instance the wallets which it’s GUI does not look like we are living in 2017 and are hard to learn how to use. or take for example the naming of the rich features as ""mosaics,apostille,NIS"" . These are away from being catchy.. it's just plain confusing.   Also, the harvesting feature and the PoI which is awesome and makes it is not officially explained on how to use it and how works! It’s just a pity! 

I'm just trying to say some updates revolving this PR/Marketing matter could calm down the anxiety among the holders. In my humble opinion if you want to take it to the next level you need to stop being so ""community driven"". It’s ok to have people revolving and developing stuff on their own but  the NEM Foundation can't depend on some random developers, or hosts such as Alexandra or Tony to show to the world how great NEM is..  Official PR agencies are needed,   you need to hire spokemans..videos need to be popping up every week in the official NEM channel to explain how to use the wallet and the API !

To wrap up.. It's obvious you've been working a lot the past 3 years to make a nice code, project which has some many features other blockchains lack. Now it's time to stop being so shy and show this is not a Linux-like community but a solid currency backed by a main entity called “The NEM foundation"".  

I believe it is time to focus on marketing guys and don’t underestimate the power o money needs to flow in to gain traction..for good your idea is you need to sell the damn thing �� 

Best regards for you and the NEM project!

** L.Wong:**

Thanks for your suggestions. It is not as simple as just go out there to market ourselves. NEM's current capitalisation is not a fluke shot. It was done with minimum $$ because we were worth much less before and did not have money.

Although we did not have major big through in terms of huge market acceptance, but we are getting recognised as the main player ahead of our major competition. We will be there. And the way we do it is different. But we should get there.

Instead of spending huge $$ on marketing, we intend to spend huge dollars on making our presence felt by way of being physically present in opening up centres of excellence. We will hire people to do business development and we shall continue to spend money on PR releases (which is much cheaper). But our physical presence, market engagements, and PR news releases will eventually be something that will move the market eventually.

Nothing is easier and long lasting than actual engagement. Other cryptos may spend money on advertisements and branding, but in the end, it means nothing when the product is not ready. No mainstream will get sucked into it.

Can I check whether this node is still active? Or can someone explain why I'm not harvesting blocks anymore?

2. How much is harvesting profitability? I've found users' estimates of 0,5-1% per year, is it so? 
3. I calculated yield of about 2,65% per year for running a supernode (based on 645 wallets with balance &gt;3,000,000 tokens). Is it correct?
4. What is current state of development process?
5. How is development funded? It seems like team has 4,000,000,000 unclaimed tokens in their possession, is that right?

I've bank transferred some cash but it's taking awhile to show up in my account - all the while NEM is rising!

Just so I have the process down for when the money finally hits (first time buying anything other than Bitcoin):

1. Get bitcoin from bitstamp
2. Transfer bitcoin to poloniex in exchange for NEM

Does this sound correct?

Do I need to activate the nanowallet on windows or anything for my first NEM deposit?

Thus, exchanges and banks (not running on fractional reserves) would have to make their funds illiquid in order to perform staking. This would be unacceptable if people were not able to withdraw their money, and therefore it is risky for them to stake. As for PoI, it seems like it doesn't require any locking up of funds, only a vesting period. I haven't run the math, but it seems like a significant portion of exchange/bank funds would be vested at any given period of time. Am I understanding this correctly?

According to Business Korea, the task force held a joint meeting on Sunday where authorities planned to introduce these increased regulations for trading among the country’s domestic exchanges.

As people realise the massive problems that BTC is facing, the idealistic BCH crowd thinks that people would jump to BCH as the new bitcoin. 

If there is a BTC fallout, instead of using outdated tech in BCH, more than likely we will see a greater uptake in alts.

Now let's be realistic here, do you think NEM is poised to take over as no.1 crypto? With its confusing name (NEM/XEM), I highly doubt NEM would be able to do it.

I'm in two minds. On the one hand the token provides a 5% discount for every ICO launched on the platform. This is similar to a degree to why people purchase BNB on Binance to minimise transaction fees. BNB has seen some decent gains as a result.

I don't see a huge amount of value in the occasional right to vote, but I guess it's a nice addition.

I'm not seeking advice on whether I should invest, just curious if I'm missing something and what the NEM community thinks about the value proposition.

It shows Remote Status Active, Harvest Status is Active, and my balance is all showing as Vested, yet I only ever got 3 blocks harvested and that was in the first week or so, but its been months since then with 0 harvested.

A month or two ago, the node I was using stopped working and I did change nodes, and ever since, 0 harvested.  I used the telegram bot to find an open node.  I tried a different node at one point, and same result after a week or two of harvesting.

I'm saying this because this is a growing market. In my opinion it's not even at 5% of its full potential. So selling now for a 100%-200% profit and not waiting for a 1000%-10000% profit it doesn't make sense to me.

In the end, I prefer to lose all the money from my portfolio than regretting that I lost a potential profit of 10000%.

Now, I'm waiting for my bank to do the money transfer so I can buy more tomorrow. I need to wait 1 day and pay 15$ for this transfer. My bank is my biggest motivation to invest in cryptos. :)

On the 28 August, 2017 I accidentally transferred 1190.217 XEM tokens from Bittrex to Changelly Exchange, instead of my NEM NanoWallet, as can be seen in my withdrawal history on Bittrex. (I mistook my NanoWallet address for the Address at the top of the transaction history list, which was Changelly's, from my 1st prior purchase of XEM directly through the wallet. Duh.)
Changelly support identified my XEM and say they have returned the coins (minus 15 XEM transfer fee) back to the original address it was sent from - my Bittrex XEM address.
Here is the link they sent me to prove the return transaction: http://chain.nem.ninja/#/transfer/2f0b72634817e60452d731ff8a93647cf35bf61dcb8cec9154a4c30147609342

The XEM has still not shown up in my XEM Bittrex wallet. Some two weeks later, and I get no reply from Bittrex support, except for an automated email saying 'we're busy'.
It looks as though Changelly has actually made the transfer, or?
Can anyone please advise?

Make sure you send your exchange XEM message (This is a unique message that is required to transfer to the exchanges) when transferring.   As a very safety precaution, also write the message when you are withdrawing from the exchanges and here's why.  If for some reason it bounces back due to incorrect address (we all make cut and paste errors), there's a high percentage that your XEM will not transfer correctly and might get lost.  If it does bounce back to the exchanges for any reason, you will retain the message and it should make it safely back.

We do this on both sides of the transaction - the buyer and the seller (merchant). In order to achieve those goals, we need a smooth transition from traditional payment methods, such as credit cards, to more progressive ones, like cryptocurrency. It is naive to believe that buyers and sellers will suddenly forget about plastic cards, which have a strong presence in the market and don’t go away anytime soon. Thus, Graft combines both methods and makes the payment process simple and acceptable in any situation. The buyer can pay with their cryptocurrencies directly wherever it’s possible, and use the plastic card, which is linked to the wallet, in any other place that is not yet familiar with crypto. The same is with the seller. Using the same point of sale app, merchant can accept various crypto-currencies and credit/debit cards.

In addition to these main goals, we are designing additional services that will be provided by GRAFT network to improve the lives of sellers and buyers. For example, obtaining an instant credit by the buyer, or creating merchant tokens, which will be used by sellers as “private cryptocurrency” for important business functions such as store credits, loyalty rewards, gift certificates, and discount coupons.

There is another interesting and promising feature, which is in conjunction with merchant tokens converts Graft from ""another payment network"" into a universal payment platform. This feature is called ""vchain"", from the combination of words ""virtual"", ""chain"", and ""blockchain"". Using vchain, sellers can connect several points of sale located in one store, or even create a network (“chain”) with multiple stores. Buyers can also use vchain to manage multiple wallets linked to each other and transfer funds for free between multiple accounts, which is useful for family or corporate accounts.

And finally, a few words about security and privacy. GRAFT uses the CryptoNote protocol, which is by far the highest achievement of modern cryptography. CryptoNote provides incomparably better privacy conditions comparing to any other blockchain protocol. Payments recorded on the Graft blockchain can not be viewed or tracked. CryptoNote completely conceals from prying eyes almost all the attributes of the transaction: the buyer's address, the amount of the payment, and the address of the seller. On top of that, GRAFT adds another feature that is unique and has not yet been implemented by anyone else: the hidden amount of transaction fee. Thus, serious buyers and sellers, who really care about the privacy of their financial transactions, for the first time have an opportunity to make their payments in cryptocurrency or cards without the risk of spying from competitors, criminals, or just random people.

1. A blockchain that verifies all legit websites for cryptocurrency. Everyone can rest assured all links in this blockchain are genuine and will not be phishing links. Can partner with Google on this.  
  
2. Facebook started from a school community app, so make one with blockchain featuring full anonymity and no duplicate accounts from students. Bullies run rampant because the majority is silent about it. With full anonymity, students can now condemn bullies in public without getting backlashed. They can also defend bully victims and debate important topics openly without being shamed/intimidated. Basically giving a voice to the voiceless.  
  
3. A scientific journal based on blockchain, with genuine data on total peer reviews, sample size, etc on every specific hypothesis. Also included are proof of lobbyists, amount of money involved, which tells the reliability of data.  
  
4. Using blockchain to ID human trafficking victims and help to eradicate human trafficking organisations. Not sure how this can work but it's worth giving a thought.  
  
5. Journalism. Blockchain can ensure journalists get their stories published/reach end users without censorship and editing from middle-men with conflicting interests. Especially powerful with audio/video, potentially world-changing.  
  
6. Invention/patents. Inventors can publish their discovery/invention in a blockchain without getting their works altered/corrupted/destroyed in any way. Especially powerful for non-profit inventors who just want to change the world, but always stopped by people who do not want the invention to reach the public.  
  
7. Education. Publicly verifiable education lessons without the intervention of people who do not want the public to get educated. ;)  
  
8. Language/translation. Publicly verifiable translation system that can help communications being translated immediately on the blockchain at increasingly accurate level across all languages. One-world language anyone?  
  
9. AI. Talk to Elon Musk, blockchain might help him to solve a big problem that he faces with AI.  
  
10. 'Social Credit'. Think of it as something that tells how well a person contributes to the society. It must not be sold, but earned by participating in social activities. Helping the city to clean up the community hall? 2 points. Volunteering at the pet shelter? 2 points. Things like that.  
  
These are just some I can think of now.

New to NEM and it'll be awesome if we can work out some confusions:

From what I gather, NEM is essentially an improved version of current Blockchains - eliminating the need for wasteful mining practices, discouraging hoarding of XEM tokens, allowing multi-signature transactions for adoption of financial industries and etc. 

However, it doesn't seem to have the functionality of Ethereum's Smart Contracts on the basis that, at the current state, they're not a very practical or safe solution for the financial industries.*

Therefore, the questions are:
1) How do you think NEM will play out in the coming years? Are they only focusing on blockchain stuffs and leave the other part of the equation (smart contract implementations) to someone else? 
2) If yes, does this mean that NEM and Ethereum's smart contract capability can work together? 


*Catapult whitepaper page 16-17:

     ""The very existence of smart contracts in an immutable and irreversible state can only lead to much resources wasted on the deployment of it, especially if it needs to be 100% full proof and tested. This is never usually the case in any software solution project. The more complicated the project is, the more prone it is to have bugs. A slight mistake can result in a systemic failure, and no financial institution should even consider that as a possibility. 

Square pegs will never fit perfectly into a round hole. Having a smart contract on a blockchain is one such example. As it is now, most financial institutions already have well defined centralised smart contracts that they have been using for years. These are all controlled and they can be stopped, corrected of bugs, and run again. Outputs are final and definite. Any such bilateral or multilateral contract is cross-verified between multiple parties. A smart contract on blockchain is not possible to do that, i.e., the smart contract cannot be replaced with another program after being put onto the blockchain.""

The white paper further shits on smart contracts by stating how they cannot work in isolation and needs a middle-man to feed the contract data, thus making it centralised when it should've been decentralised. (Although ChainLINK should be able to solve this problem)


Thanks for reading!!

On September 9 TMC set a top at 179 billion, since then it is struggling: October 14 till 22 it tries to pass resistance points at 175 b, without any success. How TMC develops, that's the one million dollar question, and food for the experts.
There is also cannibalism going on since the end of June till now: Bitcoins TMC percentage jumping from 38% to 58%,
rank 2 Ethereum drops from 32% to 17,5 %, and rank 3 Ripple drops from 24% to 8 %. In fact many alt coins have been eaten by Bitcoin, also NEM I'm afraid. This week I see perhaps some change. So my conclusion is that NEM is part of a bigger system, and at this moment it can only grow by eating other coins. I doubt if that is realistic.
You can follow TMC on CoinMarketCap; at this moment it is 165.377.537.714 dollar, I agree a lot of money.
But can be much much more, hopefully!

######NEM TEAM AND ORIGINS


[NEM foundation](https://nem.io/about/foundation/ )


 It is incorporated and based in Singapore, not for profit. ""The sole purpose of the Foundation is to introduce, educate, and promote the use of the NEM blockchain technology platform on an international scale to all industries and institutions.” – from foundation page. Lon Wong (President) and Jeff McDonald (VP) are two of the notable leaders and names of foundation. Foundation is spending $40 million in the next year (mostly 2018) to expand globally. $5million went to the blockchain global center in Kuala Lumpur

- [Initial distribution](https://forum.nem.io/t/not-claiming-nemstake-why-it-is-no-longer-possible-and-the-history-of-the-process/2859)
 - 9 billion XEM was originally distrusted to 1500 original stake holders evenly plus several multi sig accounts for marketing, distribution to late redeemers, operational costs, node rewards, and future development. The link ere is a description of the history of the process.


######THE NEM TECHNOLOGY


[White paper](https://nem.io/wp-content/themes/nem/files/NEM_techRef.pdf)


Rather than PoW or PoS, NEM uses Proof of Importance. Higher importance score gives a higher chance to harvest a block. You need 10k XEM vested (explained below) to get a POI score, otherwise PoI score is 0.
The amount required to be vested can be changed in future if necessary. Algorithms make it so scores cannot be manipulated or gamed. It's more useful than just harvesting – a form of reputation. Can be used for voting and preventing spam.



**Harvesting**


 Harvesting in NEM is the process of generating blocks and earning the transaction fees in that block as a reward for the contributed work. The PoI (Proof-of-Importance) algorithm determines who is allowed to generate a block (or more precisely: which generated block is considered as valid). Account connects to super node to harvest. When a new block is created, harvesting account gets the fees. In order to be eligible for harvesting, the 10,000 XEM in your account must be vested. “Vested” means that the XEM have remained in your account for a certain number of days. (Usually a couple of weeks, depending on the amount.) 10% of unvested balance gets moved to vested balance per day adding to your vested balance. A one-time fee of .15 XEM is required to start harvesting. Harvesting block difficulty is kept within certain limits and fluctuates with a cap of 5%. See page 17 of Technical Reference (white paper) for more detail. A separate account is created for delegated harvesting that connects to main account. Private key of main account is not exposed as the key of the proxy/created account is used to harvest. That proxy account harvests with 0 XEM (so no funds can be stolen), but uses the PoI of main account.  Fees collected get sent straight to main account. You can turn of PC with delegated harvesting. No hardware is required to harvest.


**Security**


“Sybil Attacks” were taken into consideration, PoI is Sybil resistant with below*


Uses NCDawareRank (Similar to PageRank). If you were to send portions of your balance to other accounts and send all of that XEM back to main account, the PoI score adjusts for this. Whales and spammers would gain very little PoI for this and it actually decreases after a certain point in simulations.
 

Other steps taken include; vested Balances with 10k XEM, taking days/weeks to be fully vested so one can’t immediately attack system, you can only be so many accounts that can then attack the system.


Sending XEM between two accounts adds PoI score at a decaying rate. PoI decays over time. Sending XEM only gives temporary boost. Largest component of PoI is amount vested. Advantage of gaming or spamming to get more PoI is minimal. PoI gaming will not result in a significant qualitative advantage over actors with the same balance who do nothing. (Tech Ref pg 37). PoI gives accounts with smaller PoI and vested balances more salience in the network than small time users in a PoS network. It also gives less salience overall to richer accounts than PoS. There is a theoretical maximum PoI score so whales cannot dominate.


*P2P Reputation Management, modified version of EigenTrust ++*


Uses modified because original EigenTrust++ was written with file sharing networks in mind where incomplete data is shared. NEM network downloads entities in its entirety and needed to be refined. NEM uses elliptic curve cryptography to ensure confidentiality, authenticity and non-reputability of all transactions. It uses the Twisted Edwards curve, which is considered one of the safest and fastest digital signature algorithms.


*Protecting against spamming (Technical Reference pg 14)*


Consider the unconfirmed transaction cache as having 1000 slots for a node. As long as less than 120 slots are filled, no transaction is rejected. Otherwise if there are already 120+ slots filled and transaction signer A arrives, that transaction is put into an equation to decide if they have a fair number of slots already taken up. If A occupies less slots than its fair share, the new unconfirmed transaction is accepted.
Note: You can increase the chance that your new transaction is accepted by voluntarily increasing the transaction fee.


**Network**


Nodes synchronize time to keep time stamps for transactions and blocks consistent. It's comprised of NIS super nodes and nodes. Each one associated with a primary account, used for authenticating responses by that node. This prevents attackers impersonating a node without a private key. Having an account with a private key is how you can run a node

*Super Nodes*

Super nodes first tier of network. Super nodes do heavy lifting of creating blocks and confirming transactions. An account needs 3,000,030 XEM to start a super node. As of October 21, 2017, there were about 670 super nodes online with 25% being in Japan, 18% in Germany, and 18% in the US

[Node Locations](https://nemnodes.org/)


*Nodes*


Nodes are light clients, like nano wallet and are the second tier of network. It allows more users to use PoI (With 10k vested). Harvesters collect transaction fees from blocks they harvest. Harvesters keep 100% of harvested amount.These can also be run on something like a Raspberry PI to harvest although this is no longer needed since delegated harvesting was implemented.


######FEATURES AND ASPECTS OF NEM


**Mijin**


Mijin is the private blockchain solution developed by Tech Bureau. Mijin can be used by companies that want their own blockchain solution to improve their existing businesses. Transactions across private chains (Mijin) require the use of the public blockchain and XEM. Any customers paying for products or services from companies that are using Mijin pay with XEM from the public chain and the transaction would be recorded on both public and private (Mijin) blockchains. Mijin uses the NEM blockchain technology and therefore, XEM. 


**Universal easy to use RESTful JSON API**


[Linke to a great explanation of what an API is.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7wmiS2mSXY )


The easy to use NEM API can be used with any programming language, making it easy to find developers to start using NEM. 


Each node provides the API gateway that applications may use to access the blockchain and its features. This means that your application does not need to run any complex node software; all usage functionality is available through the API interface on each node in the network itself. This means that the blockchain can be used to create a variety of solution architectures with light-weight code in any language. For a few examples, it can provide direct mobile app access, be a gateway for client apps or web services, and link existing business contract logic, systems, or databases to the blockchain. 


**Smart Contracts are not on blockchain**


This is by design as on chain smart contracts have posed serious risk for other blockchains, have presented scalability issues, and can lead to too much resources being wasted on the deployment of it. For NEM, smart contracts can be executed off chain, such as on company servers, and the transactions can be recorded on the blockchain through the NEM API. Instead on chain smart contracts, the below customizable smart assets can be used on chain.


**Mosaics**


Mosaics are the smart asset of NEM. Any kind of asset, real or digital, can be connected to a mosaic. They have customizable names, descriptions, divisibility, quantities as either fixed for mutable, and transferability restrictions if necessary and can have levies applied to them or be levies themselves on other mosaics.  Example: The DIMCOIN ICO distributed their coins via mosaics. You invested XEM and they would send you a mosaic containing the tokens. The mosaic looks similar to an email with an attachment, the attachment being the asset. Once received, you can easily see your list of mosaics in the Nano Wallet. In the DIMCOIN example, you can then send those coins from the mosaic to other wallets or exchanges. 


**Namespaces and subdomains**


This is a domain naming system. Continuing with the above example, when buying in the DIMCOIN ICO, the tokens came in mosaics and the tokens were named “dim:coin”. “dim” is the name space (what domain the asset is coming from) for the DIMCOIN tokens and “coin” is the subdomain (a description of the asset). Hence “dim:coin”. What’s special about this is that there can only be one namespace in the blockchain. So, you can be certain that when you receive the mosaic with “dim:coin” that it actually came from the DIMCOIN foundation because only they have access to the namespace, root domain “dim”. 


**Messaging**


NEM messages can be open, encrypted, and hex. They can be of any length up to 320 characters (272 encrypted), and messages can be strung together if needed. These can be used with mosaics to be official records, dates, or descriptions of the asset. Messages can also be used in sending XEM from one account to another.


**Multi-sig Accounts**


Unlike other blockchain solutions, the multisig account is not created by combining public keys from other accounts. Instead, a pre-existing and funded address is converted into a multi-signature account and the cosignatories are assigned to it. The cosignatories can be assigned in any m-of-n combination where both the m and n can be any number of 1-32 (up to 32 cosignatories on an account); this includes 1-of-1 multi-signature contracts.
 

A 1-of-1 multi-signature account is possible in NEM as the account being turned into a multisig account has its private key nullified; meaning, it no longer has any power to initiate transactions. Only a cosignatory’s private key can initiate transactions on the multisig account’s behalf. It is therefore that accounts in NEM’s multisig implementation can be analogously thought of as parent/child accounts, where the parent accounts are the cosignatories and can make the child account, multisig account, make any transaction.
 

This is useful because now a dedicated account representing a blockchain notarization can receive messages to update the blockchain notarization, and can receive assets/mosaics sent to the dedicated account locking in value or adding status to the blockchain notarization. But the other subtle yet critical utility about NEM’s multi-signature solution is that, the dedicated blockchain notarization account be transferred from person to person. This means that the account is no longer “just an account” but instead is a certification account representing the state of the underlying content that is linked. These certification accounts are called “Apostille accounts”.


**Apostille**


[White Paper](https://nem.io/wp-content/themes/nem/files/ApostilleWhitePaper.pdf)


A notarization system that can be moved, changed, and updated on both the private and public blockchains with multisig accounts. Uses for Apostille would include car titles, government registration, digital media licenses, luxury consumer goods and anti-counterfeiting, two party legal contracts, and any other need for notarization.


An application framework convention with the above properties is powerful because 1) multi-signature contracts allow these Apostille accounts to be transferred or conjointly owned, 2) using namespaces denotes authority, authenticity, and authorship, 3) mosaic assets can be sent either to or from the Apostille account representing value or status, and lastly, 4) messages can be sent to or from the Apostille account representing additional information and updates.


######NANO WALLET AND CATAPULT


**Nano Wallet**


[Nano Wallet Download](https://nem.io/downloads/)


Can be used desktop or smartphone. Don’t need to sync or download blockchain.


In the wallet you have access to Apostle, Mosaics, Name spaces and subdomains, a voting center, messaging, your delegated harvesting, sending and receiving XEM, XEM market information, and details of transactions and assets. 


Address book


*An Address could be as simple as a user’s account full of coins, like most blockchains. But it could also represent things like: a package to be shipped, a deed to a house, or a document to be notarized.*


You can also buy XEM right in the wallet through Changelly. 


**Catapult**
 

[White Paper](https://nem.io/wp-content/themes/nem/files/catapultwhitepaper.pdf)


Catapult is the big upgrade the NEM developers have been working on for some time now. It’s an upgrade of the core NEM technology from Java to C++ for scalability and speed. It will be deployed on Mijin first (Lon Wong said in interview “before end of 2017”), then the public chain afterwards. In tests, it has achieved over 4000 tx/s and averaging in the 3000 tx/s range. 


It’s designed to be a highly customizable blockchain solution that can be utilized by any company, but specifically financial institutions. It’s ease of use and flexibility are meant to help facilitate the gradual shift from banks existing platforms to a blockchain driven system as its core operating platform.


It'sAPI gateway allows the blockchain to be easily connected into other centralized (new or existing solutions) or decentralized (new consensus driven solutions implemented by other initiatives) systems including smart contract systems, internal process driven solutions, settlement, payment, and clearing systems. 


[An article by Lon Wong examining what Catapult was designed for.](https://nem.io/wp-content/themes/nem/files/RadicalizingEquityMarket.pdf)


*Catapult will have the below features and highlights*


 High scalability, design based on the industry standard tiered web architecture commonly found in enterprise computing 
 Interoperability – allow external decentralized or centralized applications or smart contract solutions to transact using the blockchain. 
 High transaction rates (in excess of 3000 transactions per second) 
 Introduction of a high performance and highly scalable API gateway server layer with an open integration architecture 
 High throughput message queues for real-time analysis and big data analytics of transactions 
 Embedded escrow service for exchange of assets on the blockchain – a special transaction contract 
 Permissible access to accounts, i.e., each person can only access what she can see. 
 Business Rules – rules where object states can result in an indisputable transition to a new state as a result of a definite and conclusive action, specifically on the calculation of transaction charges based on a predefined set of irrevocable and immutable input criteria. 
 Metadata – Accounts and assets shall have configurable metadata fields. 
 Use of NoSQL database at the API layer, which is more suited for high speed messaging 


*In addition to the above, the existing functions and features already present in the current release of NEM will be enhanced and ported across to the Catapult project. These include:*


 A built-in messaging solution
 A process activated or manual sign-off function for transactions, with multiple approvals, where needed.
 A multiple ledger with multiple corresponding assets in one blockchain. Every account can hold multiple assets from multiple ledgers in the same blockchain so that these accounts can be used for all products and services the bank is offering, e.g., one account can be holding USD, EUR,GBP, Gold, Interest Rate Swap, ETF units, etc., each with its own history of transaction records and balance.
 Every account can be controlled by the financial institution – allowing for compliance and AML control mechanisms to be implemented in order to manage these transactions
 Freezing accounts
 Transaction reversal with full audit trail and accountability

######FAQ

**Why is volume so low?**

Most of the XEM volume is on Zaif in Japan. Zaif does not publish their volume data as they have no transaction fees and want to prevent any bots from manipulating the volume numbers.  


**Is XEM on any other wallets like Jaxx or Exodus?**


 Unfortunately, not yet. No plans for any other wallets as of now. Nano wallet is your best option.  


**Where to buy XEM**


You can buy XEM for Bitcoins (BTC), CNY, or JPY on exchanges such as Poloniex, Bittrex, BTC38, BTER, Changelly and Zaif.
XEM is integrated with Shapeshift.


**Difference between XEM and NEM?**


 NEM is the blockchain technology and ecosystem. XEM is the crypto coin. 


**What drives the value of XEM?**


This answer is somewhere between the author’s opinion and how it actually all works and will work. (Just an FYI). The overall cryptocurrency and blockchain adoption is also a big part, like any other coin. 


Companies can easily adopt the NEM blockchain to their existing networks because it’s ready “out of the box”, making the transition smoother and easier for the companies to integrate the NEM blockchain. Mijin is also positioned to be a big player in the banks and financial institutions of Japan because Mijin was originally tested by large Japanese banks, so most are aware of it already, and it was designed with them in mind.  So, NEM being easy to use and integrate with existing systems while also being highly scalable and secure are key features of the adoption of NEM into existing companies.


 The value of XEM will increase as the NEM ecosystem described above grows and we start seeing these applications and solutions slowly find their way into everyday life, such as buying a cup of coffee with XEM (which the Hitachi partnership will likely accomplish soon).  On top of that, XEM is required to communicate between public and private chains. XEM is held on the pubic chain. These transactions between chains require a small fee and will need to be harvested and confirmed. When these companies start interacting with their clients, customers (their products and services will be integrated into the private chain, Mijin) customers and clients will need to hold XEM to interact with these companies private blockchains. So, as more companies start to accept and adopt the NEM blockchain solutions, the best currency available to interact with these companies will be XEM.

We didn’t know what to expect going in, starting with an honest project that applied our backgrounds and our awesome team’s knowledge to solve a real problem in a quickly emerging space.
We have spent several hundred hours working on a white paper, then several months of intense rapid development coming up to speed on various blockchains and developing a Proof-of-Concept prototype and apps.

We didn’t know how to market an ICO and had to learn as we went. We tried to avoid some of the shady tactics others were using and keep things transparent and honest, without much hype.
We spent many hours developing systems and processes to keep the good and weed out the bad when it came to actually selling the tokens.
Finally, we didn’t know what to expect from the community, but ended up developing the kind of support we never dreamt of.

We are truly humbled and appreciate all of your inspiring support and as we work hard toward the live network in the next few months, we will do our best to make you folks proud to stand behind an honest effort to leverage cryptocurrency value of becoming the new and better norm.

There are still a few hours left on Pre-Sale - https://www.graft.network/pre-ico/ - if you wanted to get in before it ends.

Unlike some other smart contract and token platforms, creation of GRAFT merchant token does not require any programming and can be done by anyone.

The business features described below are typically associated with using complex third party service providers and high implementation costs, which makes those services inaccessible for small to medium size businesses and expensive to large businesses. GRAFT Merchant tokens allow any merchant to implement those important business features with minimum efforts and low cost.

**TYPES OF MERCHANT TOKENS**

**Store Credits**

Store Credits are typically utilized by merchants for performing purchase returns and exchanges, when return cannot be done using the original payment method, or the merchant’s return policy does not allow the full refund. Store Credit essentially transforms return to exchange, so the merchant does not lose the customer and associated revenue.

Store Credit Token can be linked to the item price in local fiat currency, so the customer can use those tokens during next purchase “instead” of or in addition to the payment with local fiat currency. Store Credit tokens usually either do not expire or have very distant expiration date as they are basically replace the fiat currency.

**Loyalty Rewards**

Loyalty Rewards is powerful marketing instrument which attracts customers and increases spending. Loyalty Rewards can be awarded with each purchase, or as one-time bonus, or using other models. The rewards than can be used to makes purchases of particular items or all items, or converted to cash. Loyalty Rewards are not necessarily linked directly to fiat or crypto currency as they can be spend to provide discount or buy a special “unique” reward items that are not available for sale using other methods of payment.

Loyalty Rewards usually have relatively close expiration date. This way the merchant “stimulates” earning more rewards and eliminates accumulation of very large amounts of reward points that can become useless.

**GIft Certificates**

Gift Certificates can be issued by merchant in order to attract customers. In order to increase the effect, gift certificates can be sold with discount (for less than their nominal price). Gift Certificate tokens usually either do not expire or have very distant expiration date as they are basically represent the fiat currency.

**Discount Coupons**

Discount coupons can be used for one-time or long term promotions. The coupons can be distributed publicly or to individuals, in wallet or paper form. The coupon then can be scanned by point of sale in order to get discounted or even free item.

**TRANSACTIONS WITH MERCHANT TOKENS**

**Create**

Creating new merchant token (“smart contract”). Can be done using point of sale app.

**Renew**

Renew merchant token (“smart contract”). Can be done using point of sale app.

**Add**

Add more merchant tokens to the circulation.

**Issue**

Merchant’s point of sale sends merchant tokens to the customer wallet or prints a paper wallet.

**Redeem**

Customer redeems merchant tokens at merchant’s point of sale using wallet app or paper wallet.

**MERCHANT TOKEN FEES**

All the merchant token fees are paid to the current supernode authorization sample.

**Merchant Token Transaction Fees**

Merchant always pays the token transaction fee, which means the buyer never pays the fee. A regular transaction fee is applied to each transaction with merchant token, including adding, issuing, and redemption. As GRAFT fees are proportional to transaction amount, the fee is calculated based on 1 token = 1 GRF, although it’s not necessarily that the token has any direct link to the GRF or other currency. It’s important to note that GRAFT fees are calculated based on logarithmical formula so there is no danger of paying high fee on large amounts.

**Initialization and Renewal Fees**

The initial Create transaction implies a special higher fee because it is associated with naming a token. In order to prevent “domain squatting”, the initial fee is set to a reasonable amount that prevents massive abuse. Initialization fee of 5 GRF is required to generate a new merchant token smart contract (Create transaction). The renewal fee is 10 GRF.

**VCHAIN**

VChain allows creating a virtual chain of stores so multiple point of sales can be “connected’ to the same private “virtual blockchain”. Thus, there is a dual meaning of word “Vchain”: virtual chain and virtual blockchain. Vchain creates a private common platform for managing merchant tokens and items catalogue.

Merchants can create their own private vchain which is going to be accessible only by this particular merchant and contain all information about its tokens. Vchain allows connecting multiple points of sale or even creating a chain of multiple stores. Points of sale that belong to the same vchain can issue and accept the same merchant tokens, use the same shared item catalog stored and maintained on the blockchain, generate aggregated transaction reports, and more.

Buyers can use vchain to link multiple wallets so they can manage multiple accounts and move funds between those accounts without paying fees. This feature is useful for family and corporate accounts.

**VChain Fees**

There is initialization annual fee of 5 GRF for creating a new Vchain smart contract. The renewal fee is 10 GRF. Those fees are required to securely process the smart contract and prevent system abuse. There is a separate annual fee of 10 GRF for adding another point of sale or wallet to the vchain.

All vchain fees are paid to the current supernode authorization sample.

I'm leaving the job I hate to do something that pays less but is so much more enjoyable and rewarding, I'm going to travel, I'm going to try new things, I'm going to spend a few extra dollars every month to eat healthier, I'm going to stop worrying so much, I'm going to leave the scarcity mindset behind and focus on the big things that matter most in the one short life I have.

I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that I could have easily spent the rest of my life stuck in the unhappy rut I was in, but now I'm free and it's all because you guys decided to share the wealth created by your ideas with as many people as possible, even the ones who don't always get their paperwork in on time.

Do you know if there is any shop system available that offers payment methods with cryptocurrencies and if it features NEM?
A system that integrates into a wordpress site would be great.

If not, how do I approach such a goal? Where would I get information or people I can pay to make it happen?

Unfortunately,I have no knowledge in programming or scripting myself, except for CSS and HTML (5) and some rudimentary skills in C++ from years ago.


I know I could just add another payment method to the current system, name it ""Pay with NEM"" and after chekout show the wallet address, but since there is a lot of tickets it would be tedious to verify every payment manually.
It needs to connect to the wallet  or blockchain somehow.

1) Use the 'NEM Authenticator' App for simple and easy added security, if possible. (I didn't do this given it was brand new at the time and the message saying it was unstable)

2) When making account a multisig, create at least 4 new accounts to add, and make it 1 of 4. This increases your odds that you'll be able to have access with at least one account, causes you to be more diligent, and makes it harder to input wrong addresses. 

3) Do not copy and paste across devices. I've had it happen before where the content that i 'ctrl + c' did not paste, rather pasted the previous item I copied. I'm not sure this is what happened here, but worth noting. 

4) Double-check the ENTIRE address. Not just last 4 or first couple characters. It is worth going through each character and double checking that they match. This is especially true with ICO addresses, as it's common for scammers to put a similar address that looks like the right one, but is not and ETH gets sent straight to the thief. 

5) Don't be dumb.

Cheers my fellow NEMbers.

PS: I would post my address to substantiate the above story, however I've done this in the past, only to have my post flagged and removed.

it may be my first post on this sub, I'd like to thank you all for the great source of information that it is. 

Now, I have a honest question about my Xem investment : I am a small holder, like less than 300 Xem currently, so it's a very small bag.

I have understood that 3M of XEM is needed to be a supernode and that around $10K of XEM is needed to harvest. 

I have not much more money to put into Nem, so do you think this small bag worth the shot or should I just leave this part of my investment ?

I feel like that only big holders can have a future with Xem. Am I wrong ? Please, correct me if it's the case.

Thanks in advance and take care everyone.",NA,"79gh3q",NA,0,NA,"false",1510492270,"false","self","t5_2zxmv","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/nem/comments/79gh3q/genuine_question_about_being_a_small_holder/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

I got my token to claim my stake, set up my wallet via Chrome and did the claim with the stake. However, the software was still very early and I ended up getting locked out of the wallet before I could properly back up my private keys :(. I figure it's probably a lost cause, but is there any chance of recovering access to it?   

Update:  
I still have the original software I used to create the wallet back in the day, though when I run it it claims to find no wallets. Is there any chance that some data about the wallet it created may still be on the file system? Not sure about the specifics of the implementation of this browser-based wallet. [screenshot of wallet running and root software directory](https://imgur.com/a/kb0w2)  
  
Update 2:
There is hope! I've got the old .wlt file and the password for it, but it was generated on a very old version of the NCC client (0.6.26). Nano Wallet isn't doing anything when I try to import the .wlt (just returns to the screen before file selection, but wallet doesn't show up in the list).  


Update 3:
I managed to get into the wallet I had the files for, but (very) sadly, it was empty. In my initial panic (2 years ago) to try to get back into the account I created a second wallet with the same name, thinking it may recognize it, but instead it may have overwritten it (or not saved the original properly? who knows...) as I cannot find any trace of the original wallet at all. Thanks for all the help and hope everyone, but it looks like the dream is gone. If anyone want to take some pity on a guy who just screwed himself out of two orders of magnitude more money than he'd ever seen, you can hit me up at NDPLHLWBFRBTT6QJILF3ZWECF6YGEYLJG4MZBSC7.

I don't see a sustainable competitive advantage from nem being a first mover, if I launch a private chain with nem, my data is only as secure as the nodes I use. I don't see how nem having existed for awhile gives me more confidence in NEM as opposed to ___ in the future. 

The value for NEM holders could essentially be seen as equivalent to how much they earn into the future from staking nodes? Essentially, the current value of NEM should be a discounted cashflow of future kickbacks or do you see nem acting as a store of value in itself like bitcoin?

Lastly, I just wanted to get peoples thoughts on the level of current adoption.

So far I've managed to download NEM wallet from official web site. 

Thank you in advance for any kind of help or advice :)

We should put together something for the newbs and have it as an intro to NEM. What are some things that you wish you knew before buying NEM? (I'm thinking the current small return on harvesting would be a big one). How can we mitigate some fears and layout upcoming things for NEM in the next six months?

Achtungbaby did a great in-depth analysis of NEM but I feel that is a bit too much for someone who just wants to get the gist.

""Mijin is the private blockchain solution developed by Tech Bureau. Mijin can be used by companies that want their own blockchain solution to improve their existing businesses. Transactions across private chains (Mijin) require the use of the public blockchain and XEM. Any customers paying for products or services from companies that are using Mijin pay with XEM from the public chain and the transaction would be recorded on both public and private (Mijin) blockchains. Mijin uses the NEM blockchain technology and therefore, XEM.""

Yet I've read in other places/forums that the relationship between mijin and XEM are not clearly defined and that use of Mijin chains may not necessarily require use of XEM (which might explain why the price isn't as reponsive to positive news about catapult at this point.) Can someone clarify the relationship between mijin and XEM? Also, to the extent that the above is true and mijin apps do also get recorded on NEM and require XEM to run, is there anything that would stop mijin from migrating to a new blockchain in the future? I guess what I'm asking is, what are the benefits of holding XEM as it relates to Mijin and is an investment in XEM also an investment in Mijin?

Plans changed and it went off to do its own thing and the rest is history. 

What I'm wondering is what did NEM do to get so much further ahead? 

At various points NXT has had a much, much more active community for much longer, it was also pretty much the first ICO and arrived with a splash, yet it's now withered in comparison. 

Can anyone who's familiar with both enlighten us? I know NXT's original distribution was laughable but it's been several years now.

I had a small amount of free time so I decided to create an aggregator. I spent a few hours gathering social media links, icons, and crypto youtube channels. Every few minutes the content is pulled through the various API's organized by upload/creation timestamp and finally displayed in chronological order. Here are the page breakdowns: 
 
**Dashboard/Homepage** Displays a mix of content from all cryptocurrencies and crypto youtubers

**Coin Page** Displays content from crypto youtubers only

**Crypto Youtube Content** Display filtered content based on the cryptocurrency you selected, Also displays the social media, github, and tradingview ( chart forcasts ) links I could find

*Each page displays content in chronological order*

I will continue to add onto this service during my free time, including adding additional news/social media outlets. If you have any suggestions visit the [Feature Request](http://metavs.net/feature-request) page to submit a new idea.

NEM has always been one of my favorite blockchains, so I am super excited to announce the launch of a bi-weekly (unofficial) NEM show on YouTube. Some of you may know my CryptoDemetrius channel where I review all types of blockchains, but this new show will be exclusively focused on NEM. 

Which makes me incredibly excited to announce Tony from ""NEM with Tony"" will be co-hosting! Together, we will explore all the technical ins and outs of NEM, then apply these solutions to real world use cases and analysis to put things in perspective for the everyday blockchain enthusiast and/or investor. Each ""episode"" will contain about 20 minutes of our thoughts, and then we will open the floor for an additional 20 minutes of community discussion (some of this time may be used to address questions submitted to us throughout the previous week). 

In order to ensure this is a success, we need YOUR help to get this thing started. Please let us know your thoughts on the following: 

1. If you like this idea, we need you to subscribe to the new channel. We need 100 subscribers to get the live stream activated! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYOCP2fcR1DdEfB5tHOhIIQ?view_as=subscriber

2. Should the show include video or should it be more like a podcast? 
3. What time zone are you in / what time would you usually be around to participate in a live chat style show? 
4. We are looking at setting up a Telegram group to accept live questions/discussion points - are people cool with Telegram or is there a different method you would prefer (like the live chat directly on youtube)? 
5. Is Bi-weekly good or should it just be once per month? 
6. What should we call the show?!?
7. Can anyone hook us up with a sweet logo? 



Thanks for the enthusiasm and support! We are super excited to bring NEM to the masses.

I have been doing a lot of research lately into micro-transactional blockchain crypto's. I have came across Nem - really interesting concept, seems like more and more companies are getting interested but thats on the Japanese/Korean site, and the potential hasnt even been touched without the catapult update.

Then we have ripple , seems to me that ripple might go up if they get a proper hedge fund or a serious bank behind them as a consumer. But thats what makes it boring, you dont know whats on the horizon because there is a lot of coins being held by ripple themselves which makes me think that the coin has a huge inflation problem.

Stellarlumens, ripples fork seems to do the same thing but the price is very dependent seems to maybe there is few groups pumping up the price of this.

These are my observations so far , And I'm looking to go with my 1st purchase of crypto's soon enough. I'm leaning towards 60/40 % of my capital for Ripple/Nem what are your guys opinions?

Also they all have a similar function which is 3000+ tx/s but Nem would blow that out of proportion with catapult.",NA,"7ch5dg",NA,0,NA,"false",1512247485,"false","self","t5_2zxmv","false","general","","false","true",NA,"/r/nem/comments/7ch5dg/discussionnems_current_stage_vs/",NA,"",NA,"General Discussion","",0,0

It went up slightly, only to drop to where it was before it was released. This is while all other alt coins are going up, and bitcoin is going down (meaning money should be flowing into alts)

Catapult was the moment we were all kind of waiting for and it’s been extremely disappointing. I want to open an honest discussion without getting flamed. 

What are the pros / cons of NEM from an individual investor standpoint?

For me, 

1 - NEM to me seems more focused on development than any other coin, where as the others seem to focus on hype first, development second.

This was the biggest selling point for me, I look at every other coin on the market and the majority of them don’t do anything lol. Just flat out they don’t have a working product, yes they are the next big moon coin and they go up crazy. Common investing sense says they will eventually fail. My hope with NEM is that when the dust settles NEM and their focus on development will have them emerge as the leader in the space. 

2 - Similar to 1, NEM to me seems like they hands down have the best technology. Lightning fast transactions + a system for ICO’s and Dapps. Amazing stuff. Ties into what I said earlier, I hope others realize this… Or maybe I am just totally blinded to it and they don’t actually have the best tech. Hope someone can enlighten me here.

3 - They seem to be STARTING to care about marketing, youtube channels, etc, cool.

My sincere question here is what is going on? I’m starting to question NEM as a whole because every ALT is rising now, bitcoin is dropping AND NEM just released MAJOR news and the price just will not budge. This tells me there is something else going on we / I do not understand.

The only theory I have is I know NEM is 100% focused on being the ICO platform for businesses, I kind of relate it to the Wordpress or Wix of building a website. Sure, if you’re Google or Facebook you’ll build on something complex like Python or Java (Ethereum)…  but for the vast majority of businesses Wordpress(NEM) is perfect because it’s not complicated and easy to get up and up and running. SO therefor does NEM just not care about raising the price of the coin for individual investors? We just need to wait 3 years for actual adoption to occur? 

What’s the deal, why won’t the price budge? - speculate with me please.

As a community going forward I think our motto from now on should be 'trust, but verify'","Hey guys, 

I'm a bit pissed off with the recent Wechat fallout. The 'Tencent Partnership' was a false narrative created by a few people over in Bitcoin talk and some dick who deleted their account soon after posting this on r/nem 

https://www.reddit.com/r/nem/comments/7iglmr/partnership_with_tencent_6th_biggest_company/

This doubly sucks because it was good enough news by itself. NEM is going to be one of the first cyrpto wallets on Wechat, that's great exposure and a real world example of NEM's ease of use. Also, it was a great achievement the NEM China team! All of this is now overshadowed by people exaggerating the news.

I'll admit that I was taken up with mania (it was a hell of a way to wake up in the morning) and I don't know if the guy above was just overzealous or a blatant pumper but even when things are going our way we should reach out to twitter and the official team for word back before we start riding our lambos to moonville. (Someone needs to photoshop Lon Wong with a starting whistle or something)

To those who have just joined us, I wish it was under better circumstances but if you hang around and look at the tech that NEM offers it might just convince you to hold.

As a community I think we could have done a better job, so from now on don't 'listen and believe'... 'trust but verify'.

Yeah, just wanted to get that off my chest.

P.S. I just visited Alex's Twitter account, she's not the one to blame for this. Here is her video you can watch it as many times as you like. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL0Yg-1PPmM

She never mentions a partnership, the only people that mentioned a partnership were people on /r/nem and bitcointalk.

nem holding �� even when btc is 16,757.  That’s pretty much a 2300 dollar diff. Think about that. 

Despite what btc does, who cares. Nem is super significant and will thrive.

There are quite a few sites showing crypto prices and related data, but I still felt it could be done better. So I worked 3 months with a friend of mine to create [CoinVision.io](https://coinvision.io/).

We tried to have a fast, mobile friendly frontpage and we think allowing you to star your favorite coins is very useful. Prices update automatically and in real-time as we pull data straight from 36+ exchanges (grows by the day). Finally we put a lot of work in the portfolio and alerting system, although it is still arguably far from perfect.

We'd love to hear some honest feedback!

No complaints, it works perfectly and it's a good step forward, but I have some thoughts on the matter and would love to hear from those more involved with either China or NEM. Disclaimer, I hold &lt;1000 XEM but other than that am not too involved with the project one way or the other.

I have strong ties to Chinese society and use Wechat for payments and chats often. Thanks to the ubiquity of wechat pay it seems like another payment method (nem wallet) within that same app is dead on arrival. I can think of no compelling use case in day to day life for the app in China, and I think Wechat's importance outside of China is being overstated. Knowing Tencent, even if it did see usage in China, if they considered it competition they'd kill it without hesitation too.

Of course that's not unexpected in this stage of crypto adoption, but as best I can find NEM gets no attention whatsoever on Weibo or elsewhere. It seems the Chinese could not care less about NEM, but here we have a wallet app on a predominantly Chinese platform used predominantly by the Chinese. I struggled to find even 1 post just acknowledging the app, other than the official one. The Chinese are assuredly not deaf to crypto, although without a XEM listing on Huobi, Binance, Bithumb or the likes they'll probably stay deaf to NEM.

Would their time have been better spent developing for another platform? Are the positive effects of this app being overstated? Am I missing the point completely?

Wechat is an app popular in China, everyone uses it, really 100% of people.

Wechat started as messaging app but it became a multi-function app that does everything, social networking, news, payments, dating, ecommerce, games and so-Called “micro-apps” that are miniapps on wechat main app.

With wechat you can chat, read news, buy stuff online, pay for your shopping in store, find people around you, send money to your contacts (!), and much more

So wechat is really huge and it’s even expanding beyond China.

The Nem wallet news on Wechat is great,
There are no other crypto wallets on wechat microapps, Nem is the first one!

For sure this will boost awareness and adoption of Nem in China so again it’s a great news and I am sure they are studying something similar for KakaoTalk and Line which are the Wechat of Korea and Japan respectively (this is my speculation no official news but I feel is quite obvious Nem is developing in this direction).

-It gives us the exposure and possible reach to the Wechat users (they have a looooot of users)
-Free advertising (+2018 initiative from the foundation about going hardcore on marketing)
-Still really a sleeping giant, HUGELY undervalued.
-A lot of companies testing mijin (private chain), who knows if they are big companies, they are NDA (confidential contracts) im not saying that Tencent/WeChat is testing it, It could, it could not. 
-We still have to wait for Catapult (it will give us the boost to scale monstrously)
-Never had a hardfork, no hacked scandal, fastest transaction speed
-People in front of the foundation are great, they understand the meaning of “win-win” relationship between the longterm investors and them. 
-They are creating an ecosystem to deliver actual value to the society for the long run by their centers and projects. (No like any other hypecoin)
-We still need to penetrate other countries and big exchanges, so the upside of inflow volume is also very good.

To conclude, we should not panic, NEM is for the long run guyysss, FUD won’t kill us.

Thank you for your query and apologies for the delayed reply. Unfortunately, our support team is heavily overloaded now.

Unfortunately, we can't assist you on this matter, for we have already transferred your XEMs to your wallet. We recommend you to contact your wallet support team and ask them how this issue may be resolved. 

*No need to reply to this email in case your issue is resolved. Our support is heavily overloaded now.
Thank you.

Sincerely, 
Changelly support team. 



---------------------------------------------

This message I received is a cop out. It is an excuse to not take responsibility for their lack of front-end development to make an important field to finish a NEM transaction required. This hurts the crypto community. Changelly responded with a typical corporate business response. How many folks are upset that their NEMs are not in their wallet because of this message id error?

LOST dollars, Sitting NEMs in the chain.nem.ninja. It is easy for the front-end developers at Changelly to add code similar to this:

function validateForm() {
    var x = document.forms[""exchangeNEMform""][""messageID""].value;
    if (x == """") {
        alert(""Message ID must be filled out"");
        return false;
    }

}

This will stop a lot of transactions from just sitting and not hitting the NanoWallet. The above excuse from Changelly is not acceptable. They are responsible. Changelly fix your mistake on the front-end. My NEMs are not sent to my wallet. Yes, I did contact NEM and I haven't heard from them either yet. I am going to keep trying. Take responsibility Changelly and NEM to protect your customers, just like credit cards. It is your platform that does not prevent this common error. NEM get rid of MESSAGE ID, or Exchanges make the MESSAGE ID a required field to prevent this error. SO MANY OF US IS HAVING A PROBLEM WITH NEM transactions and your site says it is suppose to be easy. I think this is why Ripple is taking off with momemtum... because transactions are so easy!!

I'm quite familiar with the Ethereum ecosystem and know how to talk about their platform. However, ever since I've researched NEM, I've become quite the fan of what you're trying to do. It's an interesting alternative that I think has a lot of potential. 

However, I still don't feel like I have enough of the grasp of your the platform to really sell a team on what it offers.

A couple of basic questions:

1) Why should a team develop on NEM over another platform?

2) How does NEM recommend dealing with the 'smart contract' element of the application? What does that architecture look like?

3) What are some examples of successful products/companies building on NEM today?

4) Is there an easy development guide or set of resources I can give to these teams to review?

I want to hear your feedback about this. I think that /r/nem is being bridged by new accounts in order to spread FUD and also to create false hype (like that recent Tencent partnership lie) in order to pump and dump.

So my question is am I still harvesting even through in my wallet it says inactive. I can activate harvesting in my wallet and choose any node, if i choose to do so, the one which i received from xem tools in email and the node in wallet can be different unless I choose exactly the same node... so what is the best approach how do i set up xem harvesting tool to automatically update the node on my wallet or should i just update my node in my wallet on day to day basis, which is annoying as the nodes to go (restart) often.

If a coding problem is found on a smart contract NEM allows you to update the code of the smart contract because they are off chain. 

My question is, if an update occurs will it change the already existing contracts or will it only update new contracts that have been issued after the change?

I think money is pouring in to bitcoin currently due to FOMO. I am staying far away anticipating a massive crash.

Nem hasn't shown huge gains like IOTA recently and I know some people are bummed about missing massive gains but I want to remind everyone that we are in nem because we have faith in it's tech and it's future role in the blockchain world.

Nobody says you have to put everything in nem, in fact if you're here to find the next bitcoin  and think nem is going to be it thing there still isn't any promises about how nem will fare in the future. We are all here putting faith and our money into another whitepaper like everyone else in this market is doing.

I personally am not a hype investor. I don't think we'll break a dollar anytime soon but I'm in nem for the ride and because I love the tech and it's community. 

My mooning will probably with some hype coin I'll find on coinmarketcap in a few weeks in another reddit forum with everyone spamming the same trendy keywords like HODL or to the moon. 

I come back to nem because it reminds me why I invested in blockchain in the first place. Not as a get rich quick scheme but to invest In great tech I believe in.

I know I don't speak for a lot of you, i know that for some crypto investing has been their financial saviours but I just wanted to share some of my thoughts, it occured to me that many are disappointed with nems recent growth compared to a bunch of other alts. I personally have doubled my money on nem and am satisfied with it's growth at the moment. 

Not really sure what more I can say except have a great day and don't get too bummed about missing out on massive gains somewhere else. I think this situation is much like the dot.com bubble but in the end only a few coins will survive the ragnorok coming and I think nem has the foundation in place. 

Feel free to criticize me or add your own opinions.

Remember HODL TO THE MOON MY BROTHERS!!!

So I figured I'd post....

I've had 4000 XEM for a long time. Then 2-3 months ago, I got 5000 more XEM. Then this weekend, I got enough to put me over the 10,000 threshold. 

Does the 10% vesting per day begin now on the entire 10,100 balance?

Or has some of the XEM I held previously (the 4000 I got in January, the 5000 I got over the Summer) already begun vesting? 

Basically, just wondering if vesting of balances only starts once the threshold is reached.....or if vesting occurs on smaller balances, but that vesting is only activated once above 10k?

So most of what I share here comes from my experiences over those years. This is not financial advice or any other advice, just me sharing my view. 

NEM started as a baby as a satire. A silly post on bitcointalk that only required that you post to sign-up or maybe send a few nxt or a tiny bit of btc.  As those that were part of the insider club realized that this project had some potential they slowly developed some leadership skills and found a few old time programmers that wanted to strike out on their own and build something better then all the other blockchains at the time. They slowly rejected the idea of being a nxt clone and built up a framework in java for the platform.  After about a year of coding and promises they released the chain and NEM was born. About 3 hours later the network went down since the /shutdown api was public. :-)~  They have learned from their mistakes over time. 
NEM has consistently not promised smoke and mirrors. The devs take and idea and prove it is feasible with real world testing and more testing. Their coding style is professional and they only want to see their Blockchain grow up and be used in the real world.

NEM is attempting to form real world partnerships with real brick and mortar businesses. This strategy provides long term gains and does not lend to pumps and pushes in the market. 

NEM will be opensource with the release of catapult. This has been a major FUD source for a long time and it will finally allow blockchain purist to feel like they can join the platform. 

Catapult is a complete rewrite of NEM using all the lessons learned in running a 4 billion dollar blockchain for multiple years. 

Massive funds to allow for marketing and development. There is no reason to pump the price in the short term to just get some fun money. They are a serious business and deal with professionals in a serious way. 

Areas for Improvement/concerns: 
Mijin has far too much control on the IP rights of the NEM blockchain. As a private company it is only a matter of time when the devs will have to choose between the two. Having NEM become a fully open source project will allow the project to move past the closed door, backroom deals that currently happen. 

Ease of use. NEM apps need to be friendly to non technical people and not allow them to harm themselves. The apps need to be developed with the intelligence to prevent the users from doing stupid things.  This area will improve drastically with the fully open source version of NEM in the future.

I don't come from a technical background so forgive me if these question are silly and the answer is obvious (because the answer is not obvious to me). 

1.  I was wondering if the transition to catapult would affect existing software platforms that are already built onto NEM. For example, if Zeus or blockgrain were to fully integrate into NEM now would the upgrade to catapult introduce any problems for them?

2. With regards to transactions per second, does anybody know the maximum possible transactions per second on the current iteration of NEM (even though I am aware that it is currently artificially capped at 3-4/second) and the maximum possible transactions per second that is estimated for the upgraded catapult PUBLIC (not Mijin) NEM blockchain?

In order to incentivize adoption and usage, why can't we organize an airdrop to the first who use the app? As a  community we could fund some sort of airdrop wallet and have it distributed to the first say 1 million users, with a symbolic $10 worth of XEM. After all is not that much for the community and it may very well boost the usage. These numbers are just randomly chosen, they can be different.

I'm not technically able to propose some sort of smart contract to do so, but I'm sure there are people out there with the capabilities to do something that world be completely trustless and fair.

Edit: another idea would be to airdrop the first 1M users with a $10 if they have at least a $1 in their balance. This might be easier said than done since XEM price may move quite wildly.

NEM is facing strong competition and yet it feels like “We are not worried”! Need I remind you - IT’s A Race

Soon small and yet great projects like VeriCoin &amp; Verium Reserve will surpass NEM in 2018, which is a shocking thought as these have a combined market cap of 20mio$! 

Do you really want us to abandon ship and board projects like this?

Please improve on the PR. We should have way more subscribers, than we currently have. You should try to install investor confidence and not get surpassed by inferior projects like what’s happening right now.

Sorry for the rant.. but get it together please!!

It will have devastating effects not only in the Japan community (which accounts for more than 50% of all trades)  but once people start losing faith and withdrawing funds, crypto could quite possibly have an epic fail like we’ve never seen before.. 

When the dao was hacked and ethereum hard forked to create classic, it was no fault of the etherum creators, it was a flaw in the dao code which a hacker manipulated. But even still, eth hard forked and made etc.  there was huge disagreement within the community but in the end, what was needed to be done was done. Mind you the amount stolen was much much much less than what’s at stake now.

When the ceo of nem openly said that he’s not going to hard fork, is he aware of the implications that could happen because of this ????? 


As we speak the stolen funds still haven’t moved so I’m still optimistic about how this debacle will turn out, but I urge people to think what long term effect this could have on the entire community.

I wondered whether you could help me out.

1. Very simple -- who actually does the ranking calculations for the importance score? Is it each node? Does each node then use it's own calculated scores to validate chains broadcast to it?

2. How often is importance calculated and which score is used for historical transactions? Let's say I receive a broadcast of a 360 block chain. Do I recalculate importance before starting validation? Do I use one score for all the blocks on the broadcast chain? Does this mean that nodes should wait as long as possible before broadcasting, for their importance to have risen? (Example: I find a block with a hit just above ""target"", and I put it on a chain, knowing that in a hour the target will increase along with my importance, making the chain valid at my new importance score?)

3. One way to find a block is to increase my importance, another is to find a block with a really low hit. A block which hashes close to the top of 2^256 is going to hit no matter what, so why not just spend computing power looking for such blocks, by varying the composition of transactions? I can't affect the hash of the last block on the chain I receive, but I sure can be prepared with a chain of low-hit blocks ready to go once I get the chance to submit any at all.

Bonus question: what's to stop PoI leaders from deliberately generating blocks with high ""hit"", to exclude lower-ranked harvesters from competition?",NA,"7td5y8",NA,0,NA,"false",1518591355,"false","self","t5_2zxmv","false","tech","","false","true",NA,"/r/nem/comments/7td5y8/three_questions_on_poi/",NA,"",NA,"Technical Discussion","",0,0

I made yesterday my first purchase of NEM.
Great crypto asset.
However my withdrawal request from Poloniex to my local nano wallet is still pending after more than 10 hours.

Any ideas why?

I have contacted their support.

I did not use any message.
I specified the deposit address as it was given by the client.
(format XXXX-XXXX ...-XXXX )

I speculate it is possible that Polo is pending all XEM withdrawals because of the Coincheck theft but there is no indication on their Polo twitter account of such a decision, contrary to Bittrex.

Any suggestions welcome.

Tks.

I have XEM in my Nano Wallet that I use with Trezor. I have successfully sent XEM to my wallet address from the exchange, but have otherwise never made a transaction. Under my account it says I have *no public key* and must generate a transaction first to get one. Does anyone know yet the fix for this? 

I tried sending myself 0 XEM and 0.01 XEM, as was suggested on here somewhere, but then I get the error: TIMESTAMP_TOO_FAR_IN_FUTURE.

When I look *that* issue up, the fix is changing my computer time backwards (which seems absurd), but that didn't work anyway.

Anyone know why I get the second error, or how I can get a transaction going (to myself or whatever) and get the public key displaying?

And lastly, if I haven't lost anyone:
Do I really need to have a random folder with an HTML file (and other randomness) that I have to click to access the wallet? Will it eventually be more integrated with Trezor and not separate? How do you guys access it with Trezor?

"491747",1516536192,"nem","anoa-bt","self.nem","https://www.reddit.com/r/nem/comments/7rxcc5/ive_created_an_excel_crypto_portfolio_tracker/",17,39,NA,NA,"I've created an Excel Crypto Portfolio Tracker that draws live prices and coin data from CoinMarketCap.com. Here is how to create your own.","I created this sample portfolio tracker in Excel that draws live data from the CoinMarketCap API and refreshes on demand. If you have holdings across various exchanges (XRB at Bitgrail, BTC at GDAX, REQ at Binance...etc) this allows you to consolidate your entire portfolio, and also to value it more accurately in Satoshis and US dollars. Its also much quicker than logging into a site and allows for the full capability of Excel to analyze, you can run all the functions, graphs...etc that you want.

One of the things that the exchanges generally get terribly wrong is portfolio valuation and tracking. In addition to often not showing you the dollar price per coin, they also show the spot price at their exchange rather than the average across all exchanges. In many altcoins there can be quite a large spread in price between your exchange and the market average, and it generally always tends to move towards the average as arbitrage removes the difference. This is why its often better to value your portfolio using the prices on CoinMarketCap, which derives prices by ""taking the volume weighted average of all prices reported at each market.""

In my example file, I've only added the price feed for a few popular coins, but you can get live data for any coin on CMP by doing this:

1) Go to http://coinmarketcap.com and select the coin you are interested in.

2) Click the Tools tab and copy paste the link under API Tracker. For example, lets use DASH. The API tracker link can be seen on the tools page and is: https://api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/ticker/dash/

3) Go into the Excel spreadsheet and click the Data tab. Select New Query -&gt; From Other Sources -&gt; From Web, here is a screenshot. Copy paste the API link into the box, click OK.

Note: If your version of Excel doesn't have Query Editor installed by default, you can get it from the Microsoft site.

4) This will load the Query Editor like in this screenshot. Simply click on the Record field in the table and it should expand to look like this. Click on Convert Into Table on top.

5) This will make a nice table for you to import into a new spreadsheet, you can name it by changing the Name field on the right side.

6) Click save to import and this will make a new sheet with the name entered in the Name field. The data will automatically refresh every time you open the file. You can also manually refresh at any time by clicking Refresh All under the Data tab.

You can also make a quick macro to Refresh All and assign it to a button to add to the spreadsheet to make it even faster.

Having it all in Excel makes it easy to chart and analyze now.

I can also post the full excel file if someone is interested.

Happy investing :)

I've decided to invest some € (EUR) in NEM. 

I've been wondering if I understand the buying procedure well: 

First I'd need to get $ (USD) to buy BTC and exchange that to NEM 

because there are no € to NEM exchangers and 

because buying BTC with € is more expensive than exchanging my € to $ first.

So the final exchange from BTC to NEM is done at a site like Poloniex. 

For NEM I need to have a Nano Wallet, not sure about that tho... And I assume there is something similar for BTC. Is there a better way to buy NEM?

Could someone explain this stuff to me? ",NA,"7opx5a",NA,0,NA,"false",1518505308,"false","self","t5_2zxmv","false","general","","false","true",NA,"/r/nem/comments/7opx5a/i_live_in_europe_best_way_to_get_nem/",NA,"",NA,"General Discussion","",0,0

I generated a paper wallet in order to store my XEM (safest way + intention to keep the coin LT as I believe in NEM) and I withdrew my XEM directly from the exchange platform (Bittrex) to my paper wallet using the public address.
When I check balance on http://explorer.ournem.com/ I can see the address (OK), the balance (OK) but the public key is missing.

I read that I should have made at least 1 transaction (to link public key and address on the blockchain) before withdrawing from the exchange to my address. But how can I make a transaction with an offline paper wallet ? Maybe I should have asked someone to send me a little money to do so.

Question : How can I fix the problem ? Can I still link my ""offline paper wallet""'s address and public key ? How ? Or do I need to create a brand new NEM account and transfer my XEM to it from my paper wallet ? But then how can I get my XEM out of my paper wallet as my public key and address are not linked on the blockchain ?

Harvesting is similar to 'mining' XEM. When a new block is created the harvesting account gets the fees. You require a minimum vested balance of 10,000 XEM to start harvesting plus an importance transaction fee of 0.15 XEM.

**Vested balance:**

Once you have transferred any amount of XEM to your nanoWallet it begins to 'vest'. The idea of a 'vested balance' is simply a trust building mechanism within the NEM network. 10% of your total balance is vested per day. This means if you transferred 100,000 XEM to your nanoWallet and activated harvesting, you will only have to wait a day until you can begin to harvest.

If you are only investing the minimum 10,000 XEM then you will have to wait a week or two for your balance to be fully vested.

**Harvesting blocks:**

Once you are up and running you will start to harvest blocks and this in turn is where you will start receiving transaction fees.

The chances of you receiving a transaction fee (or your 'luck') is based on two things:

**-** The amount of transactions on the network

**-** Your proof of importance score

The first point is simple, as the NEM network grows there will be more transactions, as there are more transactions the likelihood of you getting a block with a transaction fee rises.

The second point is a little more complicated. Your proof of importance score is based on how much XEM you have vested, PLUS how much you are using the network. If you are simply sitting on your coins and not using them your proof of importance will go down (i.e. your luck will decrease and so will your chances of getting the next transaction block).

**Local &amp; Delegated Harvesting:**

There are two ways to harvest with NEM, local and delegated. Most people will use the delegated harvesting option, this means that you delegate your 'Importance Score' (luck) to a Supernode and they will harvest for you. It is important to note that there is no difference in how much transaction fees you will get if you choose local or delegated.

**Delegated Harvesting:**

Delegated harvesting is setup via an empty proxy account. This is done for two important security reasons. 

First, your private key is never sent to the Supernode (so no one can ever get access to your original account). The second reason is that even if a Supernode got hacked, or a bad actor was using it and got access to the proxy accounts, all they would get for their effort is *zero*. It's completely trustless.

So, what's bad about delegated harvesting? Well, sometimes a Supernode will reboot (due to upgrades to the NEM code, maintenance, power-outages) once it does that YOU have to re-activate your delegated harvesting. This is really the only downside to delegated harvesting, you have to keep an eye on the Supernode you are currently using.

**Supernode:**

This is kinda like a harvester on steroids. Supernode owners have a vested balance of... wait for it... 3,000,000 XEM. Currently we have over 500 Supernode owners and that's who you connect to when you use delegated harvesting.

These Supernode owners must also meet strict guidelines for their servers (e.g. the speed of their internet connection &amp; the version of NEM they are running) otherwise they don't get paid their stipend.

**How do I know if the Supernode reboots?**

Uh, you kinda don't. You have to log into your nanoWallet and check the delegated harvesting option now and then. There are some Telegram bots that can help, but currently this is a sorely missed feature and an annoyance for people who own harvesters.

**I know a Supernode owner... they say if I give they my delegated account address I don't have to worry about reboots, is that legit?**

Yes, that is true. A Supernode owner can add your *delegated* address so that it is automatically added on reboot. However you still should be vigilant, if that Supernode owner decides to sell and not tell you then you wouldn't be harvesting.

**Local Harvesting:**

You can also harvest on your own machine if you want. Any machine that can run a browser can harvest (there is no special equipment required to buy). The only advantage over delegated harvesting is that you know when your computer is running, the disadvantage is that you have to pay for the electricity.

**Expected ROI: (Short-term ROI)**

Currently the return on investment for a harvester is not good for the minimum 10,000 XEM investment. 

The short-term ROI on harvesters is mainly due to action on the exchanges (and in the short-term, more exchanges = more transactions) but if the long term plan of NEM takes root we could see some real, solid, long-term ROI. I wouldn't recommend that anyone get a harvester if they were only concerned about making some short-term gains.

Only buy a harverster if you are confident in the tech and willing to be patient for the next 3 - 5 years. Have a look at what the NEM Foundation have been doing in the past few years and decide whether or not they will steer this coin in the right direction. If you tick all these boxes then maybe you should consider putting money down on a harvester.

The main reason why people are buying and holding onto their harvesters (in my opinion) is the potential NEM has for the future regarding it's private Mijin network and public NEM network.

**The Mijin &amp; NEM Networks: (Long-term ROI)**

So, NEM actually has two networks. The Mijin network is designed for private business (and government) use, the ledger is private and it has NO transaction fees. You could think as the Mijin network as your local intranet or your home network... the data transfer costs you nothing (aside from the physical hardware) to move photos from your smartphone to your computer.

So, why is Mijin important? Since Mijin has zero fees then the harvesters get nothing, right?

Well... here's the rub. If two companies (or two government entities) that are using Mijin want to transact with each other, they must do so over the public NEM network; which means they have to pay a transaction fee. In this case, imagine that you want to send that smartphone photo to your friend halfway around the world. In order to transfer the data you have to use the internet (NEM), which costs money! Making sense now?

This is the real underlying power of NEM, it has a dual private and public network that integrate seamlessly with each other. It's goal is not necessarily to be the next 'currency' but to offer 'out-of-the-box' solutions for big business and government entities. Currently we have over 300 businesses and government entities using Mijin right now!

Anyway, that's about all. If you want to add anything below let me know and I'll update this. I'm gonna do a series of these because we get the same questions almost daily now.

While I am glad about the recent price surge, as I'm sure many others are too, NEM regularly lags behind Ripple. As far as I can tell this seems almost soley due to NEM's lack of exposure to Korean markets while Ripple is listed on nearly every major Korean exchange. 

Ripples best exchange by far is Bithumb KRW with $3 Billion of volume. The next closest? Bitfenix in USD at $9 Million.  

In addition Ripple has direct exposure to several other fiat currencies that NEM does not including Rubles, Thai Baht, Indonesian IDR, Brazilian BRL, South African Rand ZAR, &amp; Ukranian UAH. 

All of NEM's fiat entry points are small weird exchanges except for Zaif in Japanese Yen JPY at $113 Million volume.

Now that I'm done with learning how it works, I would like to remove the cosignatories from the multisig account.

When I go to Services --&gt; Multisignature &amp; Multi-User Accounts --&gt; Edit an existing contract, I see 2 cosignatories on the right panel (with 1 minimum signatures). So I copy one of the addresses and click the ""Remove consignatory"" button to add it to the Modifications list. For ""Change Sigs Needed"", I input ""0"" because I don't want to change anything. I want to changed from 1 of 2 to 1 of 1.

However, when I click send, a red error message pops up saying ""Failed: Cannot read property 'relativeChange' of undefined."" The same error message comes up if I leave the field blank.

If I use ""-1"", it will complain ""Multisignature account needs at least one minimum signature."" It doesn't make sense too, to have a 0 of 1 contract.

I don't dare to try ""1"", because that would mean creating a 2 of 1 multisig contract (removing one cosignatory and requiring 2 signers.)

&gt;1/ @coincheckjp hack update: NEM is creating an automated tagging system that will be ready in 24-48 hours. This automated system will follow the money and tag any account that receives tainted money. NEM has already shown exchanges how to check if an account has been tagged. ([Source](https://twitter.com/Inside_NEM/status/956964401399156736))

Certainly, no hack has  been 'solved', as she puts it in her post, but let's get to the core message: The NEM team will encourage exchanges to selectively refuse tagged tokens. And they're doing it ad-hoc, and very casually, too.

It's an absurd concept, to say the least. Differentiating between tagged and non-tagged money would completely remove its fungibility, as well as defy Crypto's central goal of being decentralized, as there is an authority, that can cherry-pick the validity of certain Tokens.

Allowing, and giving exchanges the means of rejecting certain tagged tokens (which is certainly the goal of this feature) means that one can never be sure if its Tokens are actually worth something. Naturally, there is no way for the average user to determine, whether tokens he is about to buy or receive have been in contact with tagged tokens, and are thus worth less.

It could be argued that other blockchains have taken more drastic interventions (Ethereums post-DAO fork), but I would even consider a hard-fork as a less intrusive intervention. It perhaps caused damage to people other than the thieves, but at least the network was in a consistent state again afterwards. 

With this tagging system, the fungibility of tokens is not consistent anymore, should any exchanges choose to implement restrictions, and the inconsistency will only grow as the affected tokens are being transferred, sold to clueless users, et cetera. How can a currency serve as anything other that a play-toy, when it's tokens are of different value, and consensus on this decision is found so casually?

It's similarly absurd to the idea that you might get some fake bank notes from the ATM, but you only find out once you try to spend it.

**EDIT**: As many have pointed out, NEM is aimed at businesses, which makes handling the inconsistency easier. Still, I think that some underestimate how quickly tainted tokens could get into circulation, causing confusion to traders.

First off I want to say that the actions take by coincheck to refund customers money was very swift and professional, but I should point out that a lot of people in Japan do not completely feel the same way... please let me elaborate : 


1.  At the time when coincheck restricted all nem transactions (1/26, 12:07) the value was said to be 
58,000,000,000 yen (approx 500million usd)

2. When coincheck announced their plan the next day (1/27 23:00) they made a decision to refund at current value 
46,300,000,000 yen (approx 400million usd) 

3. They have no intention of making a compensation plan to reimburse the remaining 100million usd, so right there, they made a decision that coincheck customers are going to lose a total sum of 100million usd and people will be forced to sell all of their nem at 88yen (80cents). 

4. The only thing customers of coincheck want is to have their xem restored. 

I know coincheck is going to suffer the biggest burden by forking out 400million usd and I respect their decision, but again if you were a coincheck customer, would you want to keep any of your money on their site anymore?  I sure as hell wouldn’t .

My concern is once coincheck resumes customer withdrawals (which they haven’t yet) you are going to see an avalanche of people requesting to withdrawal their funds immediately.   This could be anywhere from 1billion to 50billion maybe even 100-200 billion I have no clue.
 if this was coinchecks best resolution they could come up with, I’m afraid it will not be enough to completely restore faith in the Japanese community.

Paul here, a 19 years old student who completely fell in love with the tech behind cryptocurrencies. After I read the whitepapers a couple of months ago, I invested in what I considered it had intrinsic value and since then things went well, hence I decided to give back to the community.

Check out CoinMarketCap for Desktop and track your favourite cryptos much more easily! You can also set to launch it on startup + there are many cool features on the roadmap, such as automated refresh and ability to set notifications when a specific price is hit. Not affiliated with the official website.

You can download it from here: https://coinmarketcapdesktop.com I will continue to work on the project, as much as my time will allow it, but of course the code is open source and anyone is able to contribute: https://github.com/PaulRBerg/CoinMarketCap-Desktop

Happy tracking,

Paul Berg",NA,"7nphkn",NA,0,NA,"false",1518487024,"false","self","t5_2zxmv","false","tech","","false","true",NA,"/r/nem/comments/7nphkn/19_years_old_student_spent_my_holiday_to_develop/",NA,"",NA,"Technical Discussion","",0,0

The decentralised NEM protocol’s flexibility allows transactions to be traced in real-time, which aids exchanges to identify wallets attached to malicious activity. This helps make stolen XEM tokens effectively unusable, because they cannot be deposited without being flagged by NEM. The NEM blockchain platform itself remains secure, and all NEM mobile wallets and NEM Nano Wallets remain secure and intact.

On January 26, 526 million XEM were reported missing from wallets on the Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck due to a massive security breach of the Coincheck wallet. The NEM Foundation’s automated tagging system, making use of the decentralised API, tracing stolen funds from the hack, with the objective of identifying wallets holding stolen funds. By tagging wallet of stolen funds, anybody can easily verify if stolen NEM funds are distributed to regulated trading platforms.

“The NEM protocol’s powerful decentralised API allows anybody to track these funds in real-time, allowing exchanges to determine if deposits were stolen,” said Jeff McDonald, Vice President of the NEM Foundation. “We’re actively working with Coincheck and other exchanges to ensure proper handling of this breach. NEM.io Foundation will continue to provide updates as the situation unfolds.”

The cryptocurrency community as a whole is reminded to take proper security measures, such as using multi-factor authentication and hardware wallets.

Cryptopia has literally no support by the way. 

Is there a way to find out if the transaction is just stuck in the equivalent of the ""bitcoin mempool"" or if they just straight up robbed me and are providing fraudulent info?  Transaction ID sounds like the kind of thing you should not be able to get except from a completed transaction.

New to NEM, but otherwise savvy about the crypto space. Getting immensely puzzled by withdrawing to the Nano Wallet from Cryptopia.

Enter my address as listed in the Account section, leave the message blank, enter my PIN and set the full amount I have (~1100 XEM) to withdraw, but I'm rebuffed by ""Invalid XEM Address"". I've tried the address without hyphens, adding a garbage message to the end, all to no avail.

Am I missing a trick here? My address isn't showing up on chain.nem.ninja either: http://chain.nem.ninja/#/account/ND3HNAZKWR3ZQ5WE4P57USPDLLY2WLP37ONQ4ME2/0 is giving me a huge ""nope"" when I try to see whats going on.

Is there an initialisation process for new addresses that I'm hitherto unaware of? Do I need a faucet to drop me a dust transaction to trigger the accounts presence? Do I need to sacrifice something?

(Feel free to delete again Nem)","This will be a too long didn’t read for many but for the few enjoy.

I and my three friends were caught up in the age of extinction and were awarded 2 of 4 accounts when the NEM dev in charge couldn’t decide if we were 4 guys or 1 guy with sock puppets.

This was after providing all information and proof that was requested such as linked in accounts and Facebook accounts that were never verified (Ie never messaged) by the dev in addition to volunteering to provide any additional information that could prove definitively one way or the other that we were 4 guys. (an offer which was repeatedly ignored as can be seen in the below emails)

So the question, has the dev team ever considered actually bringing someone in to review the information in an unbiased manner to determine without a doubt that legitimate NEM supporters weren’t turfed? After all the accounts are all still sitting in the development fund so they are there, and the Nem tokens still do exist so they could be issued in order to ensure that the fair egalitarian thing is done.

In our case it came to a coin toss

Also my offer still stands we are willing to all prove that we are real live people who all went to university together who lived in residence ie the same home together and all went to Vegas together as well as any other evidence that you require to prove that you made a mistake.

Ps when are we getting the silver coins…. “original Nemians will get this”

For amusement sake I have included the bitcoin talk emails between my group patmast3r and makoto1337 so if you are all bored feel free to read and watch a little begging a little banter and what became a growing frustration. But if you do manage to read it all you will see that in the end offers of proof were ignored and that makoto1337 wasnt really sure. Oh and if a dev wants to actually read them in btt I would be happy to show them.

Now the facts:

Me and my friends provided all information that was requested of us.
We provided linked in account and facebook accounts upon the dev teams request however no one was ever contacted ie messaged to verify if they were legitimate.
We offered to provide any additional information that the dev team could think of to prove that we were legitimate.
If we were sock puppets having survived the first few rounds of culling why didn’t we take the early tokens that were offered and run, why did we stick around for the additional rounds that the devs made clear were coming?
Now to answer some questions that will be forth coming.

Why didn’t you guys bring this up before, we have tried however there has never really been a public forum in which I might get a legitimate answer and until recently did not use reddit as you can see from the age of my account.
Why were all of your IP addresses different if you lived in the same place? The answer is that we all lived in the university residence (which we can prove) and we all ran vpn’s because we like a diverse range of Netflix.
If you all had different IP’s how did they even associate your accounts and decide you were sock puppets, well we all went for a trip to Vegas to celebrate convocation from University and while we were there we checked on NEM (which we can prove there are picture)
Why were your bitcoin talk accounts so new, back then who’s wernt? In order to participate in NEM you needed a BTT account so we signed up for them.
Why were to login so far apart and at times one after the other, because I got the guys into NEM and was the driving force prodding them along.
If you guys weren’t a sock puppet why didn’t you fight harder?? I did I asked the man in charge and he made his decision so what could I possibly do?
Why did you guys take the two accounts in the end instead of holding out. Well when you get fleeced and you get the option of keeping half of your money or none of it you take half.
You guys are just a couple of NEM losers looking to cash in now and probably have nothing to do with NEM anymore. Actually after we divided the accounts I was tasked not so long ago with cashing it out, I also still trade a little under half a million in NEM coins on a regular basis.

The Age of Extinction Please Read « Sent to: makoto1337 on: March 13, 2015, 11:55:49 PM »

Hello Makoto

I will keep this short as I imagine you are a busy man these days. I am emailing on behalf of myself and three of my buddies J, J and G as we figured that it was best to just send one message and let you decide on a course of action rather than to send four separate messages saying more or less the same thing, however if you would like we can each send you one.

The situation is this, our four accounts have been flagged as sock puppets I am guessing because we are roommates and have moved all accounts to one machine, we didnt realize that this would cause an issue. So my question is what can we do and what do you need from us to prove that without a doubt that these account belong to four separate individuals. If you need we can even send a scanned copy of our driver’s licenses to prove that these belong to four separate individuals.

I convinced my three friends to join Nem because it looked like it could be a fun coin and I came across it when I was getting into mining and attempting to figure out config files for cards.

Anyways I have helped them along the way with figuring out bitcoin clients and the Nem client and purchasing their stakes and so on. One guy knows what he is doing more or less when it comes to this type of thing and the other two don’t really know that much. Basically we are their IT support in most things computer related.....

Initially they were eager to learn however they did not expect the launch to take as long as it has even though I warned them beforehand that it may take a long time and that it might not even launch at all. As a result they have mostly lost interest until the launch and have left account maintenance to me and spend most of their Nem time making fun of me because I convinced them to actually spend money on their stakes where as I got mine for free.

So the facts

We are talking about 4 accounts here not 40 or 50 or 200 like that crazy sock puppet person.

If these four accounts were sock puppets why would I not have simply loaded up on accounts during the free account registration period and avoided paying actual cash for them. I think my one buddy spent like $60 or a $100 buck the plus side to that is I got cash in hand for my bitcoin instead of paying an exchange/withdraw fee.

If these 4 accounts were sock puppets ie pump and dumpers we would have exchanged them for Nxt tokens and dumped them when each stake was worth $3600 but we didnt!

The reason our BTT accounts have been dead is because we for the most part only got them for Nem and are active on your FB page instead I under the Name of blank I am both positive and Negative in my posts as I find it gets the conversation going...... I am also the one that jokingly suggested a Nem Dev date auction.

We recently just threw all of the accounts on to one primary laptop to make life easier since the two guy lost interest in it until launch and G did not feel like deleting his Java again, deleting Nem client files again and then doing another fresh install every time a new beta was posted. We figured it was just easier to run one machines and keep it up to date then once everything launched if it launched we could go from there. We didn’t think that or at least I certainly did not think that since a person could now own/redeem multiple accounts from the exchange that centralizing all accounts would be an issue.

You can look at this two ways I suppose, the first would be that these account belong to four University buddies who hang out with one another a lot and live together or they are sock puppet accounts. Once again we are willing to do whatever is needed to prove that these accounts belong to four separate people some of us more eagerly than others.

So please let us know what we need to do the get this resolved, hope you have a great weekend and thank you for your time Makoto.

Hi,

Sorry for the late reply. Things have been quite busy.

I have no problem with giving you 2 of the 4 stakes. Your story is quite long and I confirmed your facebook account. However, it seems a little strange that the 4 of you would all have different IPs when registering from the same computer in the same house.

Does that sound reasonable?

Hello Makoto1337

Thank you for the reply, I can only imagine how busy you guys are getting ready for launch and dealing with account issues such as these.

I can also appreciate how different IP's might look a little strange however the explanation is fairly simple as I mentioned to the mysterious Nem Face Book person. We run Hola in order to experience the joys of American, Canadian and United kingdom netfilx as well as other on-line content. That combined with the fact that we were worried that we would get into this situation where we looked like sock puppets we did our best to avoid that situation basically by changing our vpn.... apparently we failed and then once multiple accounts could be claimed we didn't or at least I didn't think there there would be an issue combining everything and waiting for launch. I imagine no matter how you look at it if you have 2, 3 ,4 or 5 people living in one place they are potentially going to come off as sock puppets. Two accounts are tempting however unless we share them amongst the four of us at least two guys are getting hung out to dry.

We are willing to do whatever you need us to do the prove that we are in fact four guys living at the same place. If you are worried about us being sock puppets and dumping on launch you could always give us some of the accounts back after the launch and in the mean time we could just split the two Nem accounts 4 ways until then. That way we can prove that we arnt just here to pump and dump and if we are sock puppets we wouldn't have any negative effect on the launch of Nem.

Does that sound reasonable or is there something else that we can do to actually get all four of our accounts back?

Hello Makoto

G, J, J and myself were wondering if we could get an update on the status of our accounts. We realize that you and the Nem team are probably extremely busy with getting ready for the launch of new however since it has been 16 days since this process was started and our accounts were seized we would really like to get this sorted out.

As we have stated repeatedly we are willing do whatever is needed to prove that we are four roommates and that these accounts belong to four separate guys. Please get back to us as soon as possible since after waiting for a year and checking repeatedly we would really like to actually be part of Nem and the launch of Nem

Thank you for your time.

All the funds from the accounts marked as socks are being put into a multisig account and will be distributed from there based on the outcome of the appeal process.

Sorry for the inconvenience. Within 1-2 weeks, it should all be settled.

Hey Makoto

We were just wondering if you were still going to activate two of our accounts prior to launch and if so which of the two. We were just checking out the new client and kept getting a 121 error.

Sorry for bugging you it is just that we are really excited about the New Zealand launch on the first!!!!!

If you cant turn two of the accounts on prior to launch and prior to further looking into our account we understand

If you can please indicate which of our two accounts will come back on-line

Hello Makoto

Sadly I doubt that you and the Nem team can fully appreciate the level of inconvenience and disappointment that this is really causing the people that you have labeled as sock puppet. We have waited for 13 months for this coin to launch with multiple maybe launches and have gotten excited each time only to be disappointed with a delay.

Now as Nem readies for launch or well actually has just launched after 13 months of waiting we are now being asked or rather being told to wait another 1 to 2 weeks until the Nem team sits down and decides how plausible each of our stories are and whether or not we will be granted the privilege of being allocated our Nem stakes.

Now I one hundred percent agree that this should have been and needed to be done however they way you guys executed it couldnt be more horrible one the Name ie age of extinction that was a big slap in the face for everyone that was nailed innocent or otherwise. 2. Anyone that was a true sock puppet most probably laundered there Btt account through via Nxt tokens the moment you offered them 3. The fact that you had plenty of time to do it pre launch assuring that everyone could be part of launch instead you guys pull this the month of launch and leave a bunch of Nemians holding the bag. Basically saying hey we dont really care about you guys thanks for investing and waiting but we dont really need you around for the launch and hey maybe we will get back to you later. You guys didnt say this however thats what you actions have said.

So congrats on burning a bunch of people really interested in Nem heck I cant even run as a Node because I am not part of the genesis and I sure as heck am not putting more money into a coin that just burnt me and my roommates at launch.

I am sure that you have heard this before however I felt that I should at least have the right to voice my opinion hey who know maybe you will give the four of us our accounts maybe you will decide hey that I/we have sent to many emails and pissed you guys off so we wont get anything.

Regardless of what you decide with mine and my roomates accounts if you truly value and actually care about your community and are as egalitarian as you say. I think the Nem team should consider including a short apology to each account that they deem valid as well as a small compensation of additional Nem for making them miss the Nem launch necessary or not. After all the first two weeks of a new launch are the most exciting and have a tone of potential to sell and buy with the fluctuating price. In my case I was hoping to sell high and buy low to increase my overall Nem holdings however I clearly cant do that now.

Anyways there is my rant Nem team I will endeavor to continue keeping my posts civil however I cant really speak for G, K, and J, after all they are their own people and I am surprised that they have even started complaining on your fb page.

Have a great launch as I am sure it will be fun

That is beyond the point, today for example as I am sure you know Nem coin was trading for around $15,000 per stake only for about 20 minutes or so. Regardless I could have liquidated my share like many other did clear all of my debt and then bought back in for six shares at 2 bitcoin per share and hung out for the long term.

However due to the devs poor planing I and many other merely got to watch, and yes it was poor planning you guys could have done this early enough that it would have been resolved in time for launch.

Regardless that opportunity is well past and there will not be any big spikes with the chance to buy back in at a lower cost perhaps there will be a few minor ones if Nem hits other exchanges however they will be minimal. I imagine Nem will make it to .01 or .02 cents eventually in a year or so but hey after 13 months waiting for a final shafting without even the ability to be a node whats another 12 or 24 months.

Anyways my suggestion stands that the dev issue and appolagy and some form of compensation for whomever you deem worth of a Nem stake might make them a little less pissed about losing out on the same opportunity that was presented to the rest of the Nem community to you know make 15k and participate in launch.

Anyways I am clearly annoyed so before I say something inappropriate I will leave it here and maybe all get a reply saying hey where do we send your guys nem or hey you pissed us off and we had decided that you guys are sock puppets and no we wont bother taking you up on your offer to provide whatever we want as proof that you are four guys.

Just try looking at it from our point of view watching from the side lines.

Have a good one

Sorry that you missed the chance to dump

Anyway, I looked at your data a little more and it is not so convincing that you are all real people.

Post counts ranged from 1-6, accounts were registered 8-10 days after NEM was started, and all 4 accounts did not log in for between 148 and 152 days on BTT. Bobthebuilder23 and Squibbels both were last active at the same time as of the analysis.

I'm not trying to be mean or anything. We will probably end up giving you 2 of the 4 accounts, but even then I am not sure because all the accounts could be controlled by another user. We will think about this some more, rather than just rejecting outright, though.

« Sent to: makoto1337 on: April 01, 2015, 07:18:40 AM »

There you go twisting my words Dump no, trade yes.

After all Nem coin is a currency if you dont use it what is the point of it. If you can trade it for say 20 bit coins and then re-buy it at 2 why wouldnt you heck if I had my account today and things went well I would have my node running be up $6,000 and would have 10 Nem accounts to hold long term instead of one. After all isnt that what the bulk of nemians were doing today or should they just sit back and look at all there pretty Nem?

What can I say I look at potential and profit and I trade real stock in my spare time, I dont have much yet but I have learned a few things such as there will probably be a spike as each exchange takes on Nem so there is an opportunity to sell high and buy low and the more it is traded the more it will be traded like any currency, commodity or company on txm is.

Secondly I told you I got my roomates on board they registered got there accounts and waited I am Squibbels the squirrel as it is my gaming name G is Bob the builder he was probably a little more active as he is a miner after a while account maintenance fell to one machine and mainly me, even now they are only making the few odd posts on FB because they realized how shafted they just got. I imagine if you look back as per analysis many nemians registered a btt account got a Nem stake and didnt look back except for notifications but hey if you can get them from the guy sitting next to you or via facebook where most people are pretty much permanently logged in why would you bother with btt.

As far as the you might be a sock puppet or you might be four guys the thing I find funny is that we have offered to provided you with whatever poof that four people can reasonable provide that they live together and yet you don't seem interested. Seems like a real thorough process. So flip a coin or let us prove that we are who we say we are if this is really a egalitarian process rather then just a couple of guys sitting in a room saying hmm he/she has a good story but that guy over there we arent so sure.

Anyways I have said what I have to say so there really isnt much more that I can do/say. So I guess all wait for one of three emails

B, G, J and K where can we send your Nem
Guys please provide us with x info so we can get this sorted out.
Great story guys but your out have a good one.
Or some other variation .

Anyways regardless of how the devs could have handled this prior to launch good job on a successful coin launch and no crashes.

Have a good one.

I must give you credit for being persistent

Can you give me some linkedin/facebook pages, etc? Something to prove these are real people? So far I am just getting messages from you, so it would help make your case better with more evidence. Otherwise, people are allowed 2 accounts (1 for themselves, 1 for a loved one), so that is probably the decision that will be made.

Anyway, I was awake until 3 AM, so you probably don't want me to make a firm decision today

« Sent to: makoto1337 on: April 01, 2015, 03:19:09 PM » « Bcc: patmast3r » I find that you do not get anywhere unless you are willing to be persistent so all take that as a compliment.

Firstly I can assure you in regards to one account for you one for a loved one that I do not love any of these guys. Well maybe G face.

To prove that other three guys are real people here are copy/pasted links to there fb accounts.

https://www.facebook. https://www.facebook. https://www.facebook.

If you need anything else feel free to let me know or message one of those guys.

Have a good day.

Hello Makoto1337

I have been busy getting ready for my finals so haven't checked in here much lately. We were just wondering if there has been any update in regards to ourselves and Nem as I believe the first mentioned redemption for claims is coming up on the tenth here.

Have a good evening.

Hi,

Sorry for the late reply.

We will give back 2 of the 4 accounts. Which 2 would you like to have?

« Sent to: makoto1337 on: April 11, 2015, 08:24:53 PM » « Bcc: patmast3r »

.... Very well, if that is what you guys have decided you might as well split the nem or xem equally amongst our four accounts. I have listed our account wallet names and addresses below. Feel free to let me know if you need anything further ie there is an issue with the addresses.

So 6% of all XEM was stolen through a hack. That’s a lot of coins! 

These coins are now tainted, and exchanges will not accept them. IMO having 6% of all XEM tainted is a huge issue. 

Is there a way to just take these tainted coins out of circulation? Maybe though a fork like ETH? 

If not, what is the long-term solution? I can’t see any vendor agreeing to accept XEM if there is a chance that their wallet could get tainted.

In the past few months, I've been working on a website, called Popcoyn (https://www.popcoyn.com), which is a social network for cryptocurrency enthusiasts.
As a big fan of crypto, I incorporated all things I thought were missing from other websites into this. 


Here are some features of the website:

* I created (and will maintain) a few indexes (or indicators) for the cryptocurrency market. For example,
[CryptoCap100](https://www.popcoyn.com/view-info.php?id=CC100), sum of the market cap of the top 100 cryptocurrencies,
is the crypto equivalent of S&amp;P500 in the stock market. Similarly, [Crypto Essentials Average](https://www.popcoyn.com/view-info.php?id=CEPA)
is the average price of 12 prominent coins, and is the crypto equivalent of Dow Jones.
There's also [Bitcoin Dominance](https://www.popcoyn.com/view-info.php?id=BMD) index. You can check the list of all indexes (along with coins and tokens)
here: https://www.popcoyn.com/coins-and-indexes.php

* On Popcoyn, you can create a portfolio. That is not new. Many other apps offer that. But we allow you to share your portfolio with others, follow other users' portfolio, and see how these portfolios evolve compared to each other in easy-to-read graphs. 

* We know a lot of people don't like to make it known how much they've invested in crypto. To meet this concern, when we show your portfolio to other users,
we scale the amount of the coins in the portfolio so that your portfolio has a total value of $100K.
This way others can see the proportion of different coins in your portfolio, but will not know how much money you actually invested in crypto.

* When you change your portfolio, we keep a record of the older versions so you can compare the performance of different versions over time.

* We have weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual contests to see whose portfolio gains the highest returns. 
https://www.popcoyn.com/contests.php
You will be automatically enrolled in all contests once you make a portfolio. The winners win prizes, which are in Dogecoin. Currently, I'm using my own cryptos to fund the contest prizes but I hope over time donations will help me have bigger prizes for the contests.

* Also you receive a little bonus (in dogecoin) when new users joins Popcoyn with your referral.
https://www.popcoyn.com/referrals.php

* When looking at a coin page, in addition to usual info, you get portfolio insights: like what percent of users have that particular coin in their portfolio, or what other coins such users have in their portfolio. See this for example:
https://www.popcoyn.com/view-info.php?id=ETH

* You can sort the coins based on a variety of factors such as market cap, volume, change in price, change in volume, circulating/total/max supply.

* The website provides a comfy platform to have conversations about investment strategies, coins, indexes, or contests.


I really hope that you will use and enjoy the website. Let me know what you think.

This is a fair enough question as any retailer doesn't want to inadvertently accept stolen XEM for their product or service. 

I'm going to check with the support desk to see if this is possible or if the nanoWallet can be updated to enable a black-list of tainted wallets. I think that this opt-in service is the best way for the community to go forward after the hack. I would like to see a vote whether or not the option is opt-in or opt-out. I would personally go for opt-out.

I don't however buy the 'babes in the wood' attitude that some people have here. The vast majority of people will buy XEM from a legitimate exchange and will never encounter the stolen funds. The idea that some Johnny-come-lately will buy the stolen funds by accident is a farce. The only way to currently buy them is directly from the seller or via dodgy sites, in which case the buyer knows exactly what they are doing.",NA,"7xdqd8",NA,0,NA,"false",1520532110,"false","self","t5_2zxmv","false","tech","","false","true",NA,"/r/nem/comments/7xdqd8/does_the_nanowallet_have_an_optin_blacklist/",NA,"",NA,"Technical Discussion","",0,0

Either you get the MSM version of crypto which is incessant fear mongering or you get a blog that won't even splash out for a .com address with a 'journalist' whose 'research' is so paper thin that anyone reading /r/nem or bitcointalk would have a much better understanding of current events in crypto.

It is embarrassing that these people call themselves journalists, they are not, they are paid fucking shills and all they care about is creating click-bait titles. They don't give one fuck about crypto as a whole. If anyone was around for Gamergate this is exactly the same thing, fake 'gamers' writing bullshit pieces to create click-bait controversy.

If you are new to crypto don't fucking believe a word these crypto-blogs or the MSM say. /rant

Anyone knows if NEM ever had ICO / Crowdsale? 

If so, how much money have they raised in USD? 

Also, can anyone advise where can I check official stats for number of XEM in circulation and Total Supply? (not just CMC stats, they are often incorrect!).

(Unless there's been another?)

It seems certain that as the world warms up to crypto, there will be other countries launching digital currencies and after this NEM will be on the list of tech to consider.

NEM has a lot of advantages that puts it ahead of others, but is NEM actually up to the task for a big economy? Can it handle the needs of an entire national economy - banking, regulations, accounting, retirement savings, buying lunch, paying the babysitter? Of course all these would require new apps, but I'm talking about the blockchain network itself. Can NEM do it? Is there another blockchain that can do it better?",NA,"7zifpm",NA,0,NA,"false",1520582067,"false","self","t5_2zxmv","false","tech","","false","true",NA,"/r/nem/comments/7zifpm/can_nem_support_a_national_currency/",NA,"",NA,"Technical Discussion","",0,0

Anyone know an easy way to do this?

If you are anywhere in the United States and either lost NEM from the hack or suffered the value loss as a result of the hack, private message me if you want to discuss the possibility of recovery.",NA,"7zs7fb",NA,0,NA,"false",1520587263,"false","self","t5_2zxmv","false","other","","false","true",NA,"/r/nem/comments/7zs7fb/did_you_suffer_loss_in_coincheck_hack/",NA,"",NA,"Other","",0,0

There are estimations that nearly $85 million worth of them laundered till now.

Using the information I shared above I would like to make a calculation with my basic math:

So at that time when hacking situation happened, price of NEM was $0.95 and now it is $0.50. 

Lets say that $85 million worth of NEM sold from highest price and hackers just gave out the minimum possible amount to buyers which is roughly 89.5 million NEM, so now hackers have 411.5 million of NEM.

Well... The time is changed since then and each of his coins now worth $0.50, so their great treasure is bleeding and hackers own only $205.75 million worth of NEM right now.

Since 16 February 2018, daily volume of NEM is around $100 million. So... It looks like some of holders just overreacting. I can say that I'm a rookie in crypto but this situation shouldn't be hurting NEM anymore.

I contacted support and they told me that all the coins are frozen until further notice from the NEM team. I offered to send my documents to verify my identity but they wouldn't budge.

So now I consider the few thousands of coins that I sent lost. I'm super annoyed, not much for the money but because I really fell for it...

A bot created a NEM wallet address for me in telegram for an airdrop (I didn't have one), it gave me public and private key. I thought it could be like MEW or NEO tracker and I would be able to access that wallet online with my private key, but it seems a bit different. 
I downloaded Nano wallet, but there is apparently no option to access a wallet with only the private key. Same goes for the android app (they ask for a name of the wallet besides the private key, I don't have any). So I'm stuck and not sure what to do next.
Thank you for your help.","","83e978",NA,0,NA,"false",1522283221,"false","self","t5_2zxmv","false","techsupport","","false","true",NA,"/r/nem/comments/83e978/how_do_i_access_a_nem_wallet_created_by_a_bot_on/","","",NA,"Technical Support","",0,0

To me, it sounds like this new platform will have most (if not all) features of NEM such as API-centric SDK, superior speed and scaleability via Catapult, etc. Plus, it will have more advanced, value-added features of its own such as storage, streaming, advanced concensus, etc.

Also, although ProximaX is specifically being developed as a DApp plaftorm (which NEM is not) and said to be complementary to NEM ecosystem, wouldn't it canibalize NEM's prospective market to some extent when there are overlapping features? And while I understand that NEM is specifically designed to make integration with existing legacy system easier, isn't it DApp development scene that is all the rage these days?

Another, maybe a trivial, fact is that the venerable Mr. Lon Wong leads ProximaX project while already serving as president of NEM Foundation. Wouldn't his already valuable time and efforts spent on NEM have to be diluted on this new project? Of course I'm trusting him to keep things balanced, but still it may be something to be considered as well. 

Personally speaking, I would be much happier if NEM itself were to be extended to have such new features. But having an ICO provides a great financial incentive for the team, and having a separate project/codebase will certainly have its own advantages in development and deployment.

So, all in all, interesting times ahead...and I'm wondering what other NEM holders think about this new development. Would any of you consider investing some of your precious NEM holdings into ProximaX (or alternatively, inject fund from another source for that matter)? And another question would be: are you concerned about  this new project siphoning off valuable resources from NEM in any way?","","86qeyk",NA,0,NA,"false",1522348568,"false","self","t5_2zxmv","false","other","","false","true",NA,"/r/nem/comments/86qeyk/would_you_consider_switching_some_of_your_nem/","","",NA,"Other","",0,0

This is a question about the Coincheck hack which no one seems to be able to answer.

So essentially, the NEM foundation put a mosaic on the funds of the Coincheck hacker, meaning they will not be able to spend it on an exchange, as their addresses are blacklisted.

However, according to several news sites, the hacker has already laundered 40% of the funds through the darknet.
Now my question is how is he able to find buyers for these funds, which are obviously blacklisted?

Is something shady going on?
Has the NEM foundation not been careful enough?


Any thoughts are really appreciated.

Basically it will not prevent the hacker from cashing out anonymously, it will not reveal the hacker’s identity, and the blockchain sleuthing doesnt help. 

It is more likely that the tainted NEM will wind invested in ICOs and those companies will pay their employees and partners in it and they will become victims if exchanges are flagging and freezing their funds under poor assumptions.

In many ICOs you can give a different return address than the one you paid with. Even expanding the funding blacklist to tokens paid for wont be effective at catching anyone.

This is primarily why other blockchain teams dont do this. 

Sure, do an investigation with authorities to find the hacker. If they are noobish enough theyll get caught. At best their punishment will deter others. Tainting transactions in conjunction with that wont help, only harm others.","","84r8cz",NA,0,NA,"false",1522309991,"false","self","t5_2zxmv","false","general","","false","true",NA,"/r/nem/comments/84r8cz/tainting_has_consequences_far_greater_than/","","",NA,"General Discussion","",0,0

* Posting any kind of referral link.
* Posting unverified news
* Posting news that did not come from a well known news source.

This covers the majority of reasons while people have been banned this past month.

This is literally the first time I am posting about it to see how people would react to such a system. Currently, it is able to find arbitrage opportunities between **Binance** **Bittrex** **Bitfinex** **HitBTC** **OKEx** **Poloniex** **Kraken** **HitBTC** **Huobi** **BitStamp** **GDAX** and **Bit-Z**.

It's not like the average arbitrage bots, mine works by not only calculating the profit from buying on one exchange and selling on the other, but also considers things like trading volume to filter out poor options, so you don't waste your time on an arbitrage opportunity that only works with 10$ before the prices begin to converge. I was able to make a 7.5% profit by buying NEM on OKEX and then selling it right away on Poloniex and it didn't take me hours.

My system is designed to eliminate trading risk by keeping your money out of the market for as long as possible. The purpose is to detect when there is a large price gap between exchanges and capitalize off it, which means you get in and out as fast as possible. The only risk is the time it takes to transfer from one exchange to another, but the ERC20 tokens transfer pretty fast, so it works well with most digital currencies.

I would like to see how many people were able to successfully profit from arbitrage, also who would be interested in such a system. Especially now that NEM is so fast, it is really not as risky as other coins. Yesterday, there were opportunities for 11.5% gains.

The app is called ""CryptArbitrage"" on the Google Play Store, I'm keeping it free and adless for you guys. --------TRY IT OUT-----------------

We get stuff wrong from time to time, and always do our best to let the community know what we screwed up. 

[You can check out the episode here](https://www.cryptobasicpodcast.com/home/nem)

For this particular episode, we really didn't know much about the coin before we went into it so it's really possible we missed something big. After we finished though, we were excited for the future possibility of the coin and community. If it didn't cost so much maybe we'd make our own coin! (we're not very well off). 

We take any and all, positive and negative, criticism to heart. We're still early on in our show, so we really can change things based on community feedback and would love to hear it.

He is blaming coinpayments.net for doing nothing about it however in the first message the transaction ID that the is talking about

Is this Cryptopias Wallet? Or is there some link between Coinpayments.net and Cryptopia?

People talking about withdrawal problems on the Cryptopia forums referencing the above wallet 

https://www.cryptopia.co.nz/Forum/Thread/6797

If anyone has the time please convert those transaction ID's to links. If you have One Note you can use OCR to do most of the work for you but it is not perfect (probably easier and faster just to type it in).

So it looks like the hacker has been cashing out. The attempt to track the funds has failed.","","82d4mm",NA,0,NA,"false",1522262143,"false","self","t5_2zxmv","false","tech","","false","true",NA,"/r/nem/comments/82d4mm/is_the_stolen_nem_is_moving_to_cryptopias_wallet/","","",NA,"Technical Discussion","",0,0

I'm trying to understand what role NEM might play in the ICO space. Could you please help?

I'm aware of the difference between NEM for ICO's and full featured turing complete computer/blockchains like Ether for ICO. I'm wondering why would somebody launch an ico on nem instead of stellar?

I'm aware that Stellar has lower fees and faster transactions (and both have different blockchain/consensuss algorithm setups/philosophies), wondering if ico's on nem have any advantages or flexibility over ico's on stellar


Also would appreciate insight/comparisons to other platforms, ie lisk and neo, not sure how they compare in the space","","82fdib",NA,0,NA,"false",1522263409,"false","self","t5_2zxmv","false","tech","","false","true",NA,"/r/nem/comments/82fdib/nem_vs_stellar_for_icos/","","",NA,"Technical Discussion","",0,0

That phraseology could be interpreted as covering the actions of any third party facilitating the execution of such activities - which de facto could, and/or would, include the platform upon which such activities were enabled and/or executed... 
As an illustration look at the manner in which several banks, HSBC, Deutsche, Barclays, Citi, BofA (amongst many others...) have all recently found themselves paying huge sums of money in fines, in several jurisdictions, for facilitating money laundering activities - directly or indirectly and/or for not maintaining adequate safeguards against such activities...

The manner in which this Executive Order has been drafted, and/or could be interpreted, should be of some concern especially in the current febrile political atmosphere where it's clear that some legislators (or indeed some financial institutions or some other third party with an agenda...) looking to make mischief in the crypto space could use this to undermine the NEM project - not as an attack against NEM per se but as a wedge issue against the crypto space in general and NEM would essentially be collateral damage...

Decentralized crypto tool website, bye bye CMC","Hello /r/Nem community! We need to continue to push for mass adoption. That is why I am currently developing an all in one tool for crypto lovers and could use your help!

&amp;nbsp;

[Coin Market Street's](https://www.coinmarketstreet.com) mission is to be the all in one tool for cryptocurrency lovers, built by cryptocurrency lovers. The goal is to be a one stop website for everything cryptocurrency. We provide the ability of viewing live cryptocurrency prices, breaking news, arbitrage opportunities, and crypto shopping.

&amp;nbsp;

**For Crypto Traders** (coming soon!)
Look at live prices and arbitrage opportunities for over 1500 coins across exchanges.

&amp;nbsp;

**For Crypto Businesses and Shoppers** (coming soon!)
This is an upcoming feature I'm very excited about. The ability to buy and sell anything you want using only cryptocurrencies. No fiat allowed!

&amp;nbsp;

**For Crypto Redditors**
All cryptos are linked to their official subreddit's. When you click on a crypto, you can view live pricing as well as all of the top reddit posts for that crypto.

&amp;nbsp;

**For Crypto Developers**
The github for the website is completely opensource and available on https://github.com/apuente93/cgd

&amp;nbsp;

I know, right now the site is very similar to [CoinMarketCap](https://www.coinmarketcap.com) and [LiveCoinWatch](https://www.livecoinwatch.com). The difference is that this site will be opensource, anyone can contribute and help build it. We are also not looking to make any money, so we will never have ads or scam coin promotions, and all donations will go to continued building and perfecting of the site.
We are here for all crypto lovers. If there are any other suggestions for the website, please speak up! You can use any of the social media outlets below to do so.

&amp;nbsp;

As investors we search for ways to provide us profits from fundamental trading to technical trading
With fundamentals you need to look further than the threads of reddit posts these days. It was wonderful in the past when the market was young but with information through social media hitting the masses quickly you look for other avenues to get ahead of the game. Ill be the 1st to admit I could be beaten to information, before i could destroy a beginner/intermediate at any crypto trading 2 years ago. Now fundamentally if someone has their alerts switched on and is sitting in front of a computer its difficult to keep up.
Which brings me to something I’ve noticed over the past year. 
This post will be highly debatable and for obvious reasons some programmers prefer different languages. But for this write up we will base it on the languages of Cryptocurrencies able to run smart contracts and their own core language. As investors seem to prefer these types of currencies. 
I’m in no way a programmer, but from hanging with programmers and getting the general consensus on what they prefer has lead me to believe that Cryptocurrencies written in certain languages will not succeed in this race. Again before we enter the list, different languages are needed for different purposes, so there is no real set language thats the best for everything. However there are favourites

The list is as follows with most commonly used. I have 

Java
Python
Javascript 
C++
GO
Solidity

JAVA

As a language
Java is to repetitive, and the language to programmers is boring but fine. It allows mediocre programmers to create code without destroying everything
The platform is stable and extremely capable. Being a garbage collector language (memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use by the program), allows the programmer to not worry about some small issues that can take up time
Java is still a powerful language that shouldn’t be completely written off as some do.�
PYTHON

Python is one of the most popular languages, new graduates will understand Python over other languages Currently the main debate about the merits of Python against C/C++ comes down to what's more important to your team: development speed or runtime speed. However you can compile the language in to c/++
To finish it up, python Is for intermediate programmers, and job Opportunities are limited in non class room environments these days. Python doesn’t seem to be the choice of professional crypto programmers

JAVASCRIPT

Javascript is dynamically typed, compared to Java that is statically typed, Javascript has whats called a call and response function, its like phoning a friend and asking to look something up for you, and you sit and wait for his response with the answer you needed. You would think Java and Javascript would have something similar but besides the name they are completely different and not even written by the same people.
All in all something programmers don’t seem to use a lot of in the crypto space

C++

C++ from the research I gather seems to be a favourite amongst expert programmers in cryptocurrency. yet the downside being a code can be written by intermediate programmers that turns out to be completely terrible. C++ doesn’t cover everything but for cryptocurrencies with good coders, this language offers an array of features that out ways most of the competition. C++ is generally used in video game and desktop and mobile applications. Its probably best to use another language for web and server items.

GO

Go is a less known language but one that is enjoyed by the programmers who use it, and looked favourably upon with the cryptocurrencies who use the language. Its set to have brilliant performance and memory safety, Go compliments use cases like cloud system development and micro-services, from the information I gathered this would make a top 3 language in the world of smart contract cryptocurrency core languages. 

Solidity

Solidity is Ethereums own language, This is the number 1 pick today for token developers. solidity uses an array of programming concepts from other languages, A difficult language to get right, and one that can cause disasters if written wrong, yet solidity seems to be getting traction even with the little information and resources available for learning.

We have left out 

C
C#
Kotlin 
F#
PHP

These languages have their own pros and cons
From looking back and finding this information and talking to programmers you can say the quality or seriousness of the language being used for the specific task can give you a sense of the level of engagement required for the specifics in the coin/token. There is no real evidence of the best language for every set item they are trying to create. 
Ive discovered that solidity Go and c++ are preferred by the majority of the professional community but that’s not to say that java and python don’t hold a place either. Investors should pay close attention to the amount of skill required in the underlying languages. Would your trust in a multi Billion $ cryptocurrency, with languages that are basic??","","82mvnk",NA,0,NA,"false",1522267722,"false","self","t5_2zxmv","false","tech","","false","true",NA,"/r/nem/comments/82mvnk/does_the_language_change_how_you_invest_in_the/","","",NA,"Technical Discussion","",0,0

New here and trying to grow my understanding of blockchain outside of payment processing. I've read into smart cities with blockchain integration, I am curious to know if NEM blockchain would be suited for storing smart grid (electricity) data? Technically speaking how would this work on NEMs platform?
My question stems from reading an article which laid out the benefits of that type of data being on blockchain and my thought was how do you even get it on there?
Links to relevant reading on this also appreciated.

I have a question regarding the NEM voting module. I want to create a poll where only chosen accounts are allowed to vote on. 
Is it possible to do that with the NEM voting module? If it is possible to do, how do I do it? I already read the NEM docs but I'm not quite sure what the meaning of the poll index account is.
Thanks in advance (Y)

Once extracted, I open up the program and click ""SIGN UP"". After selecting ""Private key wallet"" and then the ""Mainnet"" network (is it dangerous send money to the address created by the ""Testnet"" network?), I enter a wallet name and password. Then I enter a 64 length hex private key, and it automatically gives me the corresponding address. Later, it then asks me to download the wallet as a .wlt file.

My question is this: Is it sufficient to store just the private key and address, or do I also need to store the wallet name, password, and wallet file?

Nano Wallet then goes on to say:

&gt; This feature requires to use the same password or it will generate different secondary accounts for the same primary private key. When backing up your data don't forget to take note of your password.

This seems strange, because when I sign up and use the SAME private key with a completely different password and wallet name, it still yields the same address, so it appears you do not have to worry about saving the wallet name or password. Yet the above quoted paragraph contradicts that. What gives?

\&lt;p\&gt;An example is Venezuela and it's petro coin, most Venezuelan citizens are having \&lt;a href=""[https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/venezuela\-petro\-cryptocurrency\-180219065112440.html""\&gt;zero](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/venezuela-petro-cryptocurrency-180219065112440.html""&gt;zero) confidence\&lt;/a\&gt; in the petro coin at this moment.\&lt;/p\&gt;

\&lt;p\&gt;My question is hypothetical in this example of the petro coin, say there was a labor\-backed Venezuelan coin for it's citizens not tied to the government and created on the NEM or Mijin network could this coin be shut down by the US if it wanted to destabilize the region?\&lt;/p\&gt;

\&lt;p\&gt;The US example is being used since there is a long history of US influence on regime change that we've had in Latin America, and since NEM is headquartered in a US\-allied country of Singapore.

And someone made a rather ill\-informed comment as follows:

""wow wat mainnet is in Java?

Even with my limited knowledge of programming thats a shit language when you aim to ""revolutionise"" content on the internet""

So, I had to counter with NEM as an example:

""Well, whether you like or hate the project, NEM is written in Java \(plus some Javascript\) and has been considered one of the most scalable and speedy blockchains out there in actual production deployment. Granted, they have been re\-writing in C\+\+ to further increase the performance, but still, the current implementation has been good enough to lure some Ethereum projects to jump ship to NEM platform thanks to the superior performance...""

If you are interested, the whole 'Is Java good enough for blockchains?"" thread can be found at the following link \(I had to chime in with a few comments of my own, derived from my personal experience as a developer\):

I’d like to share with the NEM comunity that we are on the edge of a new sports era for the non professional athletes. Stay tuned, cause in 2/3 weeks the site will be launched, and soon after that a NEM based token sale will happen. Those that want to help spread the word will be awarded with token airdrops. The MVP app is already developed and running, and after the Token sale, other 19 apps will be delivered in a max of 2 years time. The token can be used in any of those apps. It’s a huge project and I am counting on NEM comunity to make it even bigger. Can I count on you?

There is fuck all marketing being done and the only official thing to come out of consensus was already existing projects. Catapult will be released soon and fucking no-one knows it exists in the larger crypto market.

I thought this year we would be ramping up for Catapult but we are this far into the year and they have fucking blown getting the word out. No point in spending all this time working on good tech and then no one fucking knowing about it.

Ya know at one stage I thought that NEM just had a different approach to marketing but they are overlooking how important grassroots work is to this. It is hard to see them fuck this up this badly. There is little to no interaction here. ~~We don't even have a fucking merch store yet.~~ [actually... watch this space :D] 

The NEM team are letting the devs and the investors down. Jesus christ guys, get your fucking shit together, but then what the fuck can we expect when you barely half-ass update this sub. Is it too hard to get someone in here that can do CSS or put a fucking proper logo on it?

Looks like your Price Index is going up! ��

You can take a look at it on my analytic [project](https://coinsocialstory.com/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=nem%20cheking) which I’ve been working on the last few months.

The point is I'm making rating of cryptocurrencies and tokens based on different criteria – such as price, social, development and network. Every currency has it’s own page(for example, here is [yours](https://coinsocialstory.com/nem?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=nem%20personal)) 

For if I want to put the history of each coin in it, here I might need your help⚡️ If you can tell me something about NEM history, it would be very cool. You can write me here or on my email address [coinsocialstory@gmail.com](mailto:coinsocialstory@gmail.com).

Also, I'd like to hear some feedback from you about the project itself because there is still a lot to do :)

Мы с самого начала поняли, что хотим изменить мир, изменить то, как люди учат и учатся навсегда. Нам пришлось провести 4 года ...  
Tutellus родился как совместная образовательная платформа. Как Etsy, Uber, Udemy или Airbnb, мы были централизованной платформой, соответствующей ученикам с учителями, чтобы создать ценность. Мы начали в 2013 году, а через 4 года мы возглавили латинскую экосистему.  
Но мы обнаружили, что в 2017 году, если бы мы могли децентрализовать нашу модель (символизируя наши активы), то пожертвования, которые мы должны были создать в Сообществе, будут расти экспоненциально. И руководство было ясным: нам нужно было перейти от централизованной инфраструктуры к децентрализованной, основанной на блочной цепи Ethereum , с 4-слойной моделью:  
Наша четырехслойная технологическая модель

Мы используем наши фактические сотрудники APP на первом уровне, используя эти технологии; уровень APP соединяется со слоем API для всего, что в то же время связано с уровнем Token (как ERC20), который работает над слоем блокировки Ethereum .  
Мы не заинтересованы в создании «нескольких учителей-миллионеров». Мы хотим создать миллионы «тысяч». Мы хотим контролировать наш рынок , распространять богатство в Сообществе, подчеркивая его.  
Тонер TUT.

Tutellus корректирует номера для ICO из-за повышения цены ETH  
Цена ETH сумасшедшая последние 2 месяца. Когда мы начали развертывать TokenSale , цена ETH составляла около 350 долларов США. Теперь это 845USD, она выросла 2x.  
Таким образом, наши цифры получили, искренне, сумасшедшие; как hardcap, так и минимальный билет в preSale растут до уровней, которым нам было неудобно:

Hardcap 60.000 ETH означает сегодня + 50 млн. Долларов США.  
Минимальный билет в preSale 10 ETH означает, сегодня + 8.500USD.

Мы думали в наших пользователей и понимали, что для них это не справедливая ситуация : это было слишком дорого. Поэтому мы решили взять их на низкий уровень:

Hardcap до 40.000 ETH.

Минимальный билет в preSale 5 ETH.

Мы не хотим получать прямую прибыль от этих моментов повышения цен. Если мы начнем интеллектуальные контракты раньше и начнем сбор средств, изменить его не удастся. Но мы вовремя, и мы стараемся сделать все как можно более справедливым .

Всем известно, что Amazon, eBay, Etsy, Uber или Airbnb: огромные компании, основанные на рыночных моделях, где они соответствуют спросу и спросу и повышают ценность за счет услуг, основанных на ликвидности, близости, скидках или любом другом, что они хотят.

Один большой день, когда вы родились до того дня, когда вы умрете. Постоянный поток обучения никогда не останавливается. Река непрерывно течет, хотим ли мы того или нет.**

Мы используем это обучение, основываясь на собственном интеллекте. Но, к сожалению, уровень знаний не всегда достаточный. Образование, сегодня дорого и получение ученой степени - мечта для многих студентов, поскольку они не хотят жить в состоянии постоянного обучения. Онлайн-обучение действительно принесло революцию в обучение, но оно оказывает ограниченное влияние на рынок. Онлайн-обучение также имеет множество проблем, прежде чем оно сыграет огромную роль в разработке альтернативного экономически эффективного решения для самообразования.

**Что нужно для успешного обучения?**

Чтобы продолжить курсы, вы должны заплатить за платформу (если это интернет обучение). Предлагаемые курсы дороги, и не все могут быть частью необходимой программы. Курсы, связанные с работой, пользуются большим спросом, поскольку большинство людей нуждаются в работе. Отсутствие курсов, имеющих прямую связь с реальной работой, является еще одной проблемой на платформе. Люди ищут более выгодные возможности для трудоустройства, а платформы EduTech должны обеспечивать прямую связь между такими курсами, которые именно полезно изучают, благодаря чему будут заполняться необходимые вакансии на текущем рынке труда.

Непрерывное развитие технологии требует профессионалов, которые обновляются с использованием передовых навыков и собственного интеллекта. Необходимость создания платформы устойчивого образования, которая компенсирует слабость нынешней платформы, является абсолютной необходимостью.

**Предлагаемое решение**

TUTELLUS создает децентрализованную онлайн-платформу для обучения студентов всего мира. При этом Тутлесс платит студентам, чтобы учиться, развиваться и расти на данной площадке. Для учащихся, которые могут зарабатывать и оплачивать криптовалюты, доступны различные курсы, ориентированные на перспективную работу.

Преподаватели на платформе имеют возможность обучать лучших учеников по всему миру и зарабатывать мгновенно по средствам различных рекламных компаний, акций и вознаграждений на платформе. Основываясь на сложившейся экосистеме онлайн-обучения, готовая базисная модель уже работает с 2014 года, и в ближайшее время перейдет на следующий уровень. Более 1 000 000 студентов являются частью экосистемы, в которой постоянно вращается около 10 миллионов долларов.

It will enable peer-to-peer bail payments using a cryptocurrency token and will offer seamless integration with jail and detention center systems, bail payment kiosks, and Mainprise ambassadors. Token holders are able to manually or automatically configure the platform to make micropayments based on their preferences. Payments are refunded regardless of the trial outcome and token holders earn fees based on the risk scoring of the defendants. Since payments are refunded and spread across many token holders the overall risk is reduced.

Qchain is gearing up to release our minimum viable product (MVP) connected to the NEM blockchain later this month. Our platform intends to create a one-stop platform for advertisers to interact and transact with publishers for branded content, influencer marketing, and sponsorships. The public's attitudes towards digital advertising is shifting, and Qchain desires to usher in an era of authentic marketing that is both more effective for advertisers and less intrusive to consumers.  


If you are NEM supporter, you want applications built on the NEM blockchain to succeed. So help us test out our platform! We need all the feedback we can get right now, and we would appreciate anyone who can spare time to test out our demo. 

For more information, please head over to our website. If you have any questions about the Qchain project or the demo, feel free to post in the comments!

Good tidings, dear users. Many of you heard about one of the most active crypto *exchanges* in the world... Poloniex I mean. It is where my story begins...

**1) Poloniex doesn't keep its promises!**

First of all, I'd like to provide you some information about me. I am a Poloniex user, a legacy one with two factor authentication enabled. On 27 May, two weeks before deadline my account had been frozen. It had been frozen in spite of a promise ""Withdrawals will remain enabled at the daily withdrawal limits prior to the deadline"". I wish to point out that it was an official statement;

**2) Poloniex can keep your coins safe from you!**

When I knew my account had been frozen I had no choice. I had to be verified or leave them my coins. So I preferred to be verified. I've submitted them my government issued documents (they are in Cyrillic but there were no information that only international documents are acceptable) and the only adequate response was: "" The funds will be held safely in your account until the verification process is complete"". The thing is I told them that I cannot get international documents in near future and that I submitted my government issued ones. Now Poloniex is taking of my coins as hostages and urging me to be verified but don't allow me to be verified with my own government issued passport! But Poloniex promises to keep our money safe! Poloniex keeps promises, isn't it?

**3) Poloniex doesn't adhere to its User Agreement in case of it relates to user rights!**

I've spent a lot of time to be verified and nobody ever wanted to help me. Only excuses and promises to keep my money safe. Afterwards I claimed to transfer my coins to my friend's deposit adress. And there was reason to believe they would. There we are: In accordance with article 17 of [User Agreement](https://poloniex.com/terms/) ""You will be permitted to transfer Tokens associated with your Account for ninety (90) days after Account deactivation or cancellation unless such transfer is otherwise prohibited (i) under the law, or (ii) by a valid subpoena or court order."" I've created some more tickets and again no one is ever going to help. They tried to ignore my tickets first, then they started to close them as fast as they could and never ever answered me what is the reason they ignore the [User Agreement](https://poloniex.com/terms/) when it relates to user rights!

P.S. There were a lot of agents I have been talking to: Cole, Daniel, Dean, Edward, Fergus, Homer, Laura, Michelle, Rivero, Sandy etc. There might be someone who'd like to help but anyway I didn't get help so far. Be careful with Poloniex, you wouldn't like it kept your coins safe.

That is the question we, a research team from University Institute of Lisbon (ISCTE-IUL), are studying. Considering 10 different dimensions, from perceived usefulness to privacy to profitability, among others. For that we need your help to answer a questionnaire regarding your experience with cryptocurrencies.

Here is the link for the questionnaire r/[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/cryptocurrencies\_usage](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/cryptocurrencies_usage)

More details:

For this, it was created a questionnaire with Likert type scale questions. This questionnaire has some focus on the financial area, but this does not mean it is the most important. We know there are some other dimensions not being addresses in this questionnaire, such as decentralisation/government influence, that may be addressed in the future. It takes on average 3 minutes to answer. Your input is really important for this research and to help us and other researchers to boost academic knowledge in this area. After analysing and publishing the thesis and papers I will post here again with infographics and the most important conclusions of the study.

There are no open questions, but you can message me or post in the comments if you feel so. Thank you all for your participation!

Tl;dr: An academic research team needs your help to answer a questionnaire about adoption determinants of cryptocurrencies that will help boost knowledge in this area.",NA,"97jq5f",NA,0,NA,"false",1536759599,"false","self","t5_2zxmv","false","general","","false","true",NA,"/r/nem/comments/97jq5f/what_are_the_most_relevant_determinants_when/",NA,"","false","General Discussion","",0,0

&amp;#x200B;

\- There are no links in the sidebar to [nem.io](https://nem.io), nem magazine ( [nemflash.io](https://nemflash.io) ), the whitepaper or the wallet.

\- There is no 'daily discussion' thread. It will concentrate more comments on the same place, creating more buzz.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe making these 2 simple changes can make a lot of difference !

&amp;#x200B;

For the somewhat longer term, I find that there are so many  projects going on that the simple list of cool projects ( [https://github.com/Sateetje/awesome-nem-projects](https://github.com/Sateetje/awesome-nem-projects) ) is not baking the cake anymore. We should make an effort to showcase all these projects better.

&amp;#x200B;

Just my 2 xem :)

Trans-Fee Mining Model we already seen it on that 2 exchanges but Trans-Fee Cross-Chain Model is very interesting.

From  what i understand they want to build an exchange where using the  exchange coin BTL to pay for transaction fee ,the exchange use  cross-chain poa bridge to transform it in BTL20 and reward you back.

You can read more on their page [Bit.la](https://Bit.la) .The ICO will start on 25 Aug ... so in 2 days !

It's good hearing about all the cool stuff Mijin is doing but does it bring any benefit to NEM and its holders. Yes, cross-chain functions using NEM, etc, I've heard that, but is that a reality? We are seeing profitable uses going to Mijin, but what is to keep NEM Foundation from using Mijin for all or most profitable ventures and leaving NEM holders behind with a million charity and public facing PR projects? Sorry for not letting go of this bone but I'm considering a large investment in NEM and I need to lay this nagging issue to rest first. Past questions about this have brought forth some serious areas of concern that are never addressed in a solid manner considering how much money is at play from NEM investors here. Stellar does not have this issue and it's a toss up between the two right now even though I prefer NEM if it weren't for Mijin.


Is there a list somewhere of what projects are on NEM vs Mijin and what the ventures entail in terms of profit/returns. Please help.
