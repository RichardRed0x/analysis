1. Who will be able to run a node on your off-chain network (as a data holder)? Will anyone be able to join and ear TRACE that way?
2. Is the amount of TRACE fixed - meaning there will be no more TRACE created after your token sale? (the presale page says any tokens not sold after hitting the hard cap will be burned, so i imagine TRACE is finite).

Cheers

There is a circulating supply of only 250M tokens, comparing that to tron which had a marketcap of only 100M in December and over 16B in January, and plenty of other coins that have had rapid growth (Ripple, Ethereum, Neo, Litecoin, etc), it's easy to conclude that the rapid rise of a coin is not unbelievable.


Then look at what this token is accomplishing, everything they are currently doing in China, working with
-Yimishiji,
-Bits x Bites,
-and Walmart's food innovation center


Currently this coin is extremely under radar, and they have such big things going. So at 10 dollars, that puts the token at around 2.5B marketcap, which isn't that much in retrospect compared to the money thats in this market.


Once we get listed on a major exchange, I could easily see this hitting 100-200M marketcap and growing from there.


So there you have the explanation in terms of marketcap and why I see the possibility in the huge growth, but there's so much more to this with all the future partnerships and exchanges that are on the way. I'm bad at typing stuff like this, so if there's more anyone would like to add, which is a lot, please do so.

is the hardcap raised base on the rise/fall of ether?

an aritcle (https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/origintrail/) says The OriginTrail platform is already being used by over 22,500 organizations around the world, and is supported by a world-class management and development team
can you name some organizations?
I saw this comment ""SCM is a good topic of using block chain technology, because lack of transparency and efficiency. However, SCM is always a very centralized business needs for a special domain, hard to decentralized because most of party unwilling to reveal their critical information. And SCM is high cost to setup and adapt. It's not only the SCM platform issue, but also integration from each party. I am not so optimistic about this plan. High risk for investment.""

2.  If tokens are distributed before Crows Sale ends, when we contribute ETH, is that ETH immediately converted to USD to determine how many TRACE tokens we receive?
3. Or are all tokens locked and not distributed until the hard cap is reached? Then only upon the hard cap being reached will you strike a price for ETH in USD for everyone at the same time to determine what everyone is owed in TRACE tokens?

**OriginTrail Use Case - Birthday Cake**


You have a birthday coming up and decide to buy a cake. You go to the supermarket and buy a beautiful cake with lots of frosting on it. You always buy your cakes at this supermarket and they are always perfect. Then at your birthday, disaster strikes. Everyone who ate the cake got really sick and grandma even said it was the worst birthday she has ever been to. You are devastated and decide to find out what went wrong.

&amp;nbsp;

You call the supermarket and explain what happened. They apologize and offer you a coupon for a new cake, but they tell you they don’t know why the cake made people sick. It hardly ever happens and they assure you it was not their fault. Reluctantly they give you the number of the bakery where they buy their cakes from. 

&amp;nbsp;

After calling several times and talking to four different people, the bakery tells you that they will check and will get back to you as soon as they find something. They buy the ingredients for the cakes from several different suppliers. The egg supplier uses a cooled truck for delivery in order to keep the eggs fresh. The same goes for the company that supplies the milk, but they have an advanced system for temperature tracking which records the exact temperature of the milk during transport. They asks the egg supplier if they know what could have gone wrong. They check their current batch of eggs and respond that they did not find anything wrong in production. They ask the driver if something happened during transport, but he claims everything was okay. 

&amp;nbsp;

Then the bakery calls the milk supplier who uses an advanced information system to track their milk. When checking their data they find that there might have been a problem with one of the trucks, but they decide not to share this information with the bakery, because it might affect their relationship with them. After all, the problem is only minor and probably didn’t cause any damage. The bakery is satisfied with the replies from its suppliers and calls you back. They tell you that you probably didn’t store the cake correctly or used a dirty knife to cut it. What actually happened was that the driver of the egg truck forgot to turn on the cooling and left the truck in direct sunlight during his lunch. A few of the eggs went bad and this was not found during a sample check of the batch by the bakery. The driver didn't tell anyone this, because he did not want to lose his job.

&amp;nbsp;

**How does OriginTrail offer a solution?**


Instead of calling the supermarket, OriginTrail would allow you to instantly check the entire supply chain involved in creating and delivering the cake and it would have told you there was something wrong somewhere with that specific cake. Also, the bakery would have never accepted the bad eggs if they had been warned about the drivers’ error. In both cases your grandmother would not have gotten sick if OriginTrail had been used.

&amp;nbsp;

The milk company already uses advanced information systems to check their milk and if the bakery had used a compatible system, they would have been warned about the defect in one of the trucks. However, the bakery has dozens of suppliers who all use different systems and it would be way too expensive for a small bakery to have a system that is compatible with all of them. OriginTrail is a protocol that would allow any type of data to be stored on the blockchain. The bakery would not need an expensive system to integrate all of the different sources of information and the supermarket could use the same system to check to quality of the cakes from the bakery.

&amp;nbsp;

OriginTrail is not just for cakes, but could be used on any type of product. You could check that your shoes are made according to regulation or that the meat that you are eating is certified. In reality the project would not be useful for consumers directly, but it would be very useful for retailers such as Walmart, because it gives them more control over the quality of their products, making it less likely for you to poison your grandmother.

After seeing OriginTrail project on frontpage of /r/cryptocurrency, I did some research and I am a potential investor in this project, since the project doesn't really have to compete with WTC and VEN (RFID), but rather use code scanning to transfer information and store it in blockchain, which is interesting concept in my opinion. 

Nevertheless, I do have some questions.

What is TRAC token used for exactly?

For example, WTC token can be used to create childchains and transfer value between them, which means that token is in demand for companies that wish to create one childchain and join the ecosystem as well. This gives the token holders (and nodes who get rewards) the initiative to hold the token and wait for bigger adaption to sell it later.

But what about TRAC? Why should it be held, who will be the main users? If I understand correctly, then the companies will use the token to reward the nodes for transferring the tokens and maintaining the network, which should grow it's value?

"531943",1516977434,"OriginTrail","Fluzing","self.OriginTrail","https://www.reddit.com/r/OriginTrail/comments/7t4vwe/origintrail_jargon_explained/",19,62,NA,NA,"OriginTrail Jargon Explained","After reading the white paper and a few posts about OriginTrail, I noticed that there are a few key terms that are used, but hardly explained. I think it is important to understand these to be able to really understand what OriginTrail is trying to do. Below are a few that I think needed a bit more explanation. 
  
&amp;nbsp;  

**IoT - Internet of Things**
    
The *internet of things* refers to the increasing number of (autonomous) devices that are connected to each other through the internet. They can be remotely controlled or function independently on the internet and exchange data. Devices can range from self driving cars to heart monitors, bio-chips, toys etc.
      
&amp;nbsp;

**Supply Chain**
    
The supply chain consists of all the processes involved in creating and distributing a product. You probably bought your computer at a store, the store bought it from a distributor, which bought the different parts from various factories. These factories bought their raw materials from traders which in turn bought from mining companies. How does the distributor know that the factory used good quality materials? How can the consumer know for sure that the materials used were not mined using slavery? You could ask the distributor, but who does he ask? This is called a transparency problem and this is one of the problems OriginTrail is trying to solve.   
     
&amp;nbsp;

**Protocol**
    
A protocol is a set of rules in which the way data is stored and shared is written. You can compare it with language. Grammar and definitions of words determine the way in which we communicate. OriginTrail has created a set of rules in which supply chain data is stored and shared between users. Without these rules it would be impossible for users to trust or even read the data, much like it is impossible for a native Chinese to communicate in Chinese with an English speaker. You can hear them talking, but you do not know what they are saying.  
    
&amp;nbsp;
    
**Blockchain Agnostic**
    
This term is used a lot by people, but never really explained. Blockchain agnostic means that the protocol can be used with any blockchain if necessary. Right now OriginTrail uses the ETH blockchain, but it could also use and communicate with a different one like the NEO blockchain. The reason why this is important is because we do not know how blockchains will function in the future. There might be better solutions available or maybe a new customer already uses a different blockchain and cannot change blockchains for various reasons.
    
&amp;nbsp;

**Decentralization**
    
Going back to the supply chain, if we had to ask the shop owner where the materials for the computer came from, the answer to our question would be centralized. He is the one that has the relevant connections to find out, but can we trust him to give us an honest and reliable answer? Probably not as it would cost a lot of time and effort for him to find out. By asking the blockchain, the answer becomes decentralized, because we are no longer dependent on the shop owner, but rather the blockchain which is maintained and operated by many people and machines which get paid to make sure the answer is trustworthy and relevant. 
    
&amp;nbsp;

**Open Source Project**
    
The code used in most programs is not public. This means that you cannot see how a program works. In an open source project the code is made public and others can make contributions to the project.
    
&amp;nbsp;

**Information Asymmetry** 
    
Back to the supply chain. The store owner knows certain things about the computer you just bought, but he doesnt know the same things the distributor knows, who in turn does not know what the manufacturer knows. They all might be reluctant to share what they know as well. This is called information asymmetry. 
    
&amp;nbsp;

**Data and Information Integrity**
    
How do we know that what the store owner knows is correct? Does he have the correct information and is he willing to share the correct information or is he inclined to lie to us? The data he has could also be corrupted, which would make it unreadable or untrustworthy. Without the blockchain solution it is hard for us to verify the information that the owner provides us, because we do not know if either the information or the store owner can be trusted.
    
&amp;nbsp;

**Zero-knowledge Protocol**
    
A zero knowledge protocol allows you to verify a statement without being provided any information aside from the fact that the statement is true or false. For example, we have a bottle of expensive wine, but we want to make sure that the bottle was handled correctly during transport. If it was shaken too much or kept in hot conditions, it might be ruined. We can use the protocol to find out if the bottle was handled correctly. The answer we receive would be either yes or no. If the bottle was handled incorrectly we would get a no, but we would not know if it was stored too hot or if the ride it took was too bumpy.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

I hope this will help people understand the white paper and other posts a bit better. If I made any errors or if you want to add something, please comment on this post.

As January comes to an end, our Confidential Matrix team is here to give a summary of the recent market.

The first batch of CME Bitcoin Futures has expired as of 8am UTC. Previously, CBOE Bitcoin Futures expired on January 17th at $10.9k. From here on out, expect the entire market sentiment to be extremely bullish. The Coincheck hack, the largest theft in human history at $723mil USD, only led to a brief Bitcoin price dump to $8k USD before quickly correcting. The market has seemed to grown immune to FUD and most likely is about to enter the next major bull market.

Unlike the past few months, Altcoin movements are now following Bitcoin movement. Previously, any sort of Bitcoin price movement would stunt altcoin growth, but now the entire market seems to be moving together. New ICOs are also performing incredibly well, quickly hitting 10-20x after exchange listings. The year has only just begun, but Q1 and Q2 2018 should be some of the most profitable quarters ever for cryptocurrency.

The recent Weiss cryptocurrency ratings were heavily criticized for their lack of legitimacy and poor metrics. However, they are another clear indication of the legitimization of cryptocurrency. As mentioned before, ""no one has ever seen so much money leaving wall street to enter a different asset class."" Expect a lot more formal regulation to come in place this year, as well as the cryptocurrency marketcaps hitting new ATHs, easily surpassing $1 Trillion USD.

Hi everyone, this is Branimir, CTO of OriginTrail. I wanted to quickly address the technical development of OriginTrail and ""masternodes"" question for you

The OT tech team is working hard on delivering fast results and focusing on real use cases on the protocol. We are currently in the early stages of the alpha network (more explaination in my blogpost from last Thursday), moving towards the testnet deployment in Q2 this year. A big part of our work is focused on running simulations on token economics. Based on this analysis and research, we will be able to define all details regarding node requirements and bidding mechanisms for compensations.

We are looking at different forms of staking for nodes which will participate in the network, but the exact models of node engagement need further research and tweaking with real data load. This staking mechanism would have to scale well both in terms of token value as well as through the years of protocol life.

Our goals are to enable wide adoption of the protocol by equalizing opportunities to take part in the networ, and preventing the network from various forms of centralization that might be a result of an improperly set incentive mechanism from the get-go. This is why we are not going to announce any specific information until we are confident the system makes for a long term stable solution. We expect a clearer picture by the end of March 2018, and until a an official announcement from the team, consider all information regarding incentivising nodes, ""masternodes"" or staking to be just hear-say.

""We expect a clearer picture by the end of March 2018"" does not mean we will know the node requirements by then. Be patient and don't be surprised if no announcement comes March 31st.

I didn't buy any TRAC in the ICO as I missed out on it. I did buy some on IDEX and added it to MEW using the contract address.  My TRAC tokens now show up in MEW tokens. 

I have read that the WANchain tokens bought on EtherDelta will be burned (worthless) and not redeemable for mainnet WANchain blockchain coins.

""Don’t buy on Etherdelta as tokens won’t be exchanged when mainnet goes live. https://youtu.be/P54-MJWTvSE

They screwed up and didn't lock down the tokens via smart contract -- go figure. Now all those coins traded on EtherDelta, the worlds largest ethereum decentralized exchange, are not being excepted by WanChain because of the security risk and a lot of people are out of their investment.

So you can still buy on EtherDelta if you want. WC will blame you for the tokens being useless.""


Is this the same issue with TRAC?  Will I be able to redeem (token swap) my TRAC tokens bought from IDEX for mainnet tokens or will they be burnt?  

Are TRAC tokens resellable? Would the buyer of TRAC tokens be burnt since they don't have a whitelisted wallet address, such as what happened to people who bought WANchain ERC20 tokens on etherdelta?

I recently found out about this project and for me it seems this is one of the only which solve real life use cases, which is a big yes for me.

I got some questions though and it would be cool to have them answered, thanks in advance if you decide to do so:

1) I found out it only trades on shitty exchanges IMHO. With which one of them do you have the best experience? (security wise, ease of transacting stuff)

2) AFAIK this is a protocol built for most of the blockchains, but still it is an ERC20 token, right? Would you classify it as an Utility Token or as what? (bc of regulatory stuff. I could not find anywhere in the whitepaper that I do not own part of the company when buying the token eg.)

3) Is it correct that it has won the (I don't know if the name is correct) Innovation Award by Walmart? 

That would be it for now, if some more questions come to my mind I'll probably update it and/or ask in comments.

Again, thanks in advance.

If all these blue chip companies creating and implementing their own blockchains for example, why do they need our tokenized blockchains and why would they be adopting them? What would be their incentive? Why would companies adopt or utilize these tokenized smart contracts, blockchains, currency, etc when they can simple create their own from their own developers?

Let me start by saying that I am really enthusiastic about this project. The team looks solid, they already have real-life use cases showing the working product and the Supply Chain market is enormous. Conclusion: a lot of potential.


If I understand it right, the supply chain data is inserted in a certain format via the OriginTrail importer and added to the underlying blockchain (e.g.Ethereum). The writing and storing of these data is performed by nodes. And there the TRACE token comes in:  
*‘’Write (introducing new supply chain information to OriginTrail) and storing operations are
performed by nodes for which they receive the compensation in Trace tokens based on the
agreement reached, in regards to the data distribution protocol mechanism described in this
document.’’(copied from whitepaper)*


Furthermore: *‘’It is important to note that OriginTrail uses a blockchain layer which presents an independent system and thus adds additional cost depending on the chosen underlying blockchain for some OriginTrail functionalities. In case of Ethereum being the underlying blockchain, this means that a small amount of gas (Ether) is also needed to store the necessary hashes on Ethereum for the storage operation.’’*


Back tot he TRACE token: so if you can be a node you can earn TRACE, however you probably need an enormous amount of TRACE to run a node. 

Actually it comes down to one question: **How is the TRACE token interesting for us as small private investors, since there is no staking while having TRACE.**
Will the value of TRACE increase when OriginTrail is more used? I can imagine the fees have to be low, so does the value of the TRACE token? How many TRACE tokens do you need to run a node (talking about 10.000 range, 100.000 or million)?

I would like to hear your thoughts/additions/remarks.

My questions: 
How does it work?

What partnerships and experience does the team have?

How does it differ compared to other similar coins and what dis/advantages does it have? 

On what platforms do you purchase and store TRAC? 

What's your personal opinion on its potential growth over 2018?

I'd be grateful for some input.

1. The idea of the token appears to be built solely on food, which would mean that each batch of food (yoghurt, for example in the video produced) would need to have some form of unique identifier within the product. Barcodes don't contain this information, so would the expectation be that all packaging companies instal  a new service to adopt this technology? If that's not the case, what is the way that unique identifiers are added to the product?

2. Food is an extremely high unit production industry with hundreds of millions of items produced on a daily basis. How would any unique identifier on a product scale?

3. Given the whitepaper states that writers of information require Trace tokens to complete this, does that mean any factory looking to add information to the network would need to be constantly buying tokens? Let's say a factory produces 200,000 bottles of milk a day, what would the requirement on this farm be to purchase tokens to correctly identify each unit?

4. The network uses masternodes to receive payment for the work completed within the system, these would potentially represent a passive form of income which may make the token a security. Particularly with the voting rights I believe they have. Has there been any independent legal verification that the token is a utility token, and can this be shared?

5. The end user of the token appears to be someone that uses an app, based on your demo video. As you're an ERC20 token, does this mean that you'd require someone interested in tracing the tokens origin to have both Trace tokens and ETH to cover the gas of the operation for reading the item?

6. The network is reliant on the supply chain adding the correct information to the network. Where supply chains have been corrupted through suppliers incorrectly labelling their materials and bringing it into the foodchain (see the horse meat scandal in Europe), the Trace network would have no effect in identifying this. Is this correct?  Because the network relies on the actors within the network to act honestly, the problem of them acting dishonestly is not resolved here it seems. With that being the case, I'm not sure what problem is being solved by the network. It may help end consumers feel a bit better after they scan the label, but as soon as an incident is discovered that dishonest data has been used by a supplier, trust in the network would fall quickly (if this is correct).

7. (THIS QUESTION I'VE ADDED IN LATER) How will your network handle multiple ingredients? Let's say I have a Chinese ready meal that has 20 ingredients from the meat, through to noodles, salt, bamboo etc. How will that work? Or will the product only be limited to single source products?

Thanks for taking the time to read, I look forward to seeing some further insights into the network!

EDIT: I'm genuinely interested in the project, I'm just undertaking due diligence. I can see a few people downvoting which I don't think is justified. This isn't FUD, it's just business case research. I'm sure the team has the answers to these, I'm just not clear from what I've read so far.

I recently (30 minutes ago) bought in to OT and am really happy with the decision. Have to say that creating a solution that fits into current methodologies is really smart. I own a small food brand myself, and we use GS1 when shipping pallets for supply chain integrity to our international clients. I've always thought that there's quite a few fail points in there potentially due to the barcodes able to be made manually and the data entered as you wish. There could easily be interceptions or changes made if someone wanted to do so (whatever the reason may be). Fantastic that there's a GS1 advisor in there too as that really gives the claim credibility.

- Creating a cool infograohic for us to share

- Offering your services as a developer

- Sharing content on social media 

- Writing medium posts

- Making real world connections to benefit TRAC

- Offering CONSTRUCTIVE criticism

- Buying more on dips

- Letting others know about TRAC where possible

- Hodling

I've gone through the website and read everything I can. I am still having a difficult time understanding the value proposition however.

I think that it is interesting to trace a products origin. However I see not how this might interest most consumers. Most consumers are happy to get a deal or discount and care not if their products come from China or Africa. 

I know that this system might help secure the providence of various food products which may pose a health risk to children or others as was seen in China with baby formula. But I see not why TRAC would be adopted on a massive scale.

Is the target demographic the consumer or in fact governments which might have an easier time inspecting food products - FDA. 

Why is TRAC better than Walton Chain? 

And finally if I were to invest into this project and could be sufficiently convinced to do so I would do so in a big way, thus is there any information on the amount of TRAC necessary for running a master-node? Would anyone care to speculate on this final point?

**Q:**
Can’t supply chain companies just lie when submitting information to the block chain, and if so, what advantage does block chain have to traditional exchanges of information between companies?

**A**:
The key to addressing this issue is to ensure the authoritative source of the data is connected and trusted. For example, today the producer or processor shares certifications like organic or halal. The OT protocol will be able to connect all of these parties so that the owner of the certificate (or claim) is putting their skin in the game and taking responsibility for providing the data. This reduces the fraud and creates traceability of the claims and accountability. As an example, if the product is tested on the market and deemed not to be organic, the producer or processor may have a valid claim again his preferred analytical laboratory or may uncover counterfeit or bad practices in their own raw material suppliers. We are going to see mega advances in this space as the OT protocol and trace alliance program rolls out.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q:**
Hi there - been reading up on trac and had a question. I have worked at costco over 20 years and use an rf gun to track everything. Would this be the field of what origin is working in? Making it easier to prevent fraud in products or to track items in transit ect...like the market cap/token amount for a long term hodl.

**A**:
Yes and much more. In todays multiparty supply chains the data is not passed along the supply chain from producer to processor or manufacturer through to retailer. There is no legal or regulatory requirement for this. There are exceptions for big companies who have resources and source directly but there are many weaknesses in food chains. In simple terms, the OT protocol acts like the plumbing and help the data flow from party to party. The records are then immutable (cannot be changed) and this is one part of fraud protection and provides product traceability and the ability to do rapid product safety recall. But thats not all....the physical shipment of goods must be secured and the 3rd party logistics provider plummed into the network. As all of these parties will likely use different technologies including multiple blockchains, the OT protocol excels in its power to provide the plumbing because it acts as a middleware or traffic cop using structured data from the most widely used industry standards from GS1 (object ID, company ID, location ID). The combination of the GS1 standards, plus the OT interoperability plus on-pack covert and overt security features plus links to the food safety audit firm data and let's say the USDA Organic website (to verify the organic claim) all play a role in ensuring the integrity of food. OT is very well positioned to advance the food industry by providing the plumbing to connect all of this together. Cheers.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q:**
Ibm and maersk supply chain logistics management solutions that is tough competition to go up against consider the budget they will throw at it

**A**:
Not a competitive situation though. I see a lot of risk in this proposed partnership even as advertized as a not for profit. The vested interests are huge and it may not succeed as planned. I wish them the best and they are indeed two giants with resources but business is very political. For example there is also NEALnet which is also GS1 centric and claims to control 30% of all cargo shipments. This is a collaboration between the governments of China, Korea and Japan.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q:**
Wanted to ask you a question! What do you think of Hyperledger? Seems like big companies want to stick to themselves and develop their own private solutions so they can retain control over their blockchain networks. Are you worried about that and can OT compete or work with them?

**A**:
I have competed with IBM for 30 years in various roles. Tremendous company and very competent. I have also hired them when I was a CIO. We had an old saying that nobody ever got fired for hiring IBM. That said, it's quite normal that the key executive relationships developed between IBM and their global clients would lead to opportunities where IBM is leading the risk. This is normal and good news for OT because it validates the market. Moreover, outside of the big guys roughly 95% of all businesses worldwide are SME's. The OT protocol will operate as a tool than can facilitate the entry of the small players onto the global market through professional, standards based data and information interoperability. Net net, what's happening now with IBM and Microsoft is very good news for OT. Cheers

&amp;nbsp;

**Q:**
Good points John. Can you or anyone comment on what the incentive is for other companies to use the origin trail protocol? That to me seems to be the key question in terms of driving adoption across a multitude of supply chain solutions. This is also the part I do not understand well at this stage.

**A**:
Several points already mentioned above including adoption of GS1 compliant protocol which will be a requirement in food, consumer goods, pharma and med devices. The other is the reality that blockchain to blockchain will be a reality and having a neutral, standards based protocol builds trust versus having competing companies debate interoperability.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q:**
Won't VeChain, Walton, WABI, IBM Hyperledger already have their own protocols, since they every chain needs a protocol to run and for people to use their networks... why would they adopt OT as well? What would OT do if one of these large company becomes industry standard protocol instead?

**A**:
Several points already mentioned above including adoption of GS1 compliant protocol which will be a requirement in food, consumer goods, pharma and med devices. The other is the reality that blockchain to blockchain will be a reality and having a neutral, standards based protocol builds trust versus having competing companies debate interoperability.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q:**
Yes but at the same time Walmart is going with IBM for their hyperledger blockchain solution for their supply chain. Walmart is not using OriginTrail as far as I know

**A**:
Walmart will use platforms that comply with GS1 industry standards for object, party and location as well as data governance and interoperability. The OT protocol is based on GS1 and because it's opensource it provide a very unique and strategic positioning that would actually help other block chain apps become GS1 compliant. If a block chain app in supply chain is not using GS1 standards it will not succeed, period.

There are a lot of tangible and real life use cases developed and proven. That said, there is no magic wand for the instant success many are waiting for or expecting. As such, blockchain MUST be viewed as foundational much like TCP/IP was for the internet. It will take time but there is no doubt it will become the trust architecture over time.....keyword = time.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q:**
Beijing? How is OT carving out its niche in an area where VeChain, Walton, WABI are dominant and have home ground advantage?

**A**:
OT does not compete with block chain apps because it functions as a protocol or middleware to enable interoperability. China and other large markets will have multiple blockchains and interoperability is the holy grail. When you add sunk costs of ERP then the OT protocol becomes even more valuable. From a China specific perspective, the protocol is enabling Shanghai online farmers market Yimishiji to interoperate with hundreds of Chinese farmers and the protocol will scale as their business scales. I can imagine a scenario when thousands of farms in China are using it. And because it's opensource, adoption could be triggered quickly. The current apps on the market may have proprietary elements. Cheers

&amp;nbsp;


**Q:**
I would NEVER have invested in some European startup before this.

**A**:
Btw, the EU is very progressive and its a great place for blockchain startups. This past week they announced a block chain observatory group and focus. Also the leading Ag. Research university, Wageningen in NL is doing several use cases in Ag. that will help to drive adoption.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q:**
ok, so as I understand it then - it will be the middleman between blockchains. Would you mind giving me a high-level overview of the problem it solves there? ie. let's say i operate in south america but received a few orders from europe. (not sure if that is the hypothetical painpoint)

**A**:
Sure and a lot of that info is in the whitepaper and other collateral on the website. In simple terms the longer a supply chain the lower the trust. Furthermore, when dealing with many languages we have different want to describe and code 'things'. The GS1 standards are intended to facilitate these problems and are known as the language ofnl business. The OT protocol will surpass common traceability system flaws by capturing transactions and data from all parties rather than one up/one down traceability. So in that sense, OT will be able to facilitate multiple systems either blockchains or legacy apps to communicate and share structured data which created immutable records, facilitates transparency in the supply chain and enables trust.",NA,"7xez96",NA,0,NA,"false",1520532861,"false","self","t5_3nyqu","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/OriginTrail/comments/7xez96/questions_from_the_community_and_answers_from/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

I'm having problems understanding TRAC and it's functionality. I hope you can help. 

So TRAC is a token not a coin. It's primary feature is to track data in the supply chain to give endusers information about where a product is coming from. 
This data is stored on the tokens blockchain right? It is somehow verified and connected by TRAC. 

When I buy TRAC how does that benefit the network? 

When the price rises of the TRAC token how does that benefit the network? I can't see any reasons how a price increase will benefit the network.

**NOTE: THIS IS PURE SPECULATION AND ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IS CONFIRMED**

------

**Dash** currently requires 1000 coins to run a MN, which is 0.0125% of it's circulating supply and 0.005% of it's total supply.

0.0125% of our circ supply = **31 813 tokens**

0.005% of our total supply = **25 000 tokens**

------

**Waltonchain** requires 5000 coins to run a MN, which is 0.02% of it's circ supply and 0.007% of it's total supply.

0.02% of our circ supply = **50 901 tokens**

0.007% of our total supply = **35 000 tokens**

------

**VeChain** is probably the best comparison since it's circ supply is half of it's total supply (similar to TRAC) and it's dif tiers will probably be closer to what TRAC will offer. I'll just compare circ supply on this one.

VeChain Authority MN requires 250 000+ tokens, which is 0.0519% of it's circ supply.

0.0519% of our circ supply = **132 089 tokens**

VeChain Mjolnir MN requires 150 000+ tokens, which is 0.0311% of it's circ supply.

0.0311% of our circ supply = **79 151 tokens**

VeChain Thunder MN requires 50 000+ tokens, which is 0.0103% of it's circ supply.

0.0103% of our circ supply = **26 214 tokens**

VeChain Strength requires 10 000+ tokens, which is 0.0020% of it's circ supply.

0.0020% of our circ supply = **5 090 tokens**

------

Personally, I feel like we'll see something similar to VeChain (10/25/50/100k?). 

Hope my math wasn't too broken and that it help some of you that were curious to compare the numbers.

The other day I posted about investing about 100 dollars in TRAC. Well, today I scraped up money that will in no way affect the life of my family, etc., and bought about 1k. TRAC.  I have other crypto and am thinking about trading 3 NEO for ether and using it to buy more TRAC. Any thoughts or opinions? I guess my reasoning behind it is: 

I’ve done my research and reading (white paper, road map, etc.) and have such a good feeling about this project. 

2). It’s market cap is so low and has tons of room for growth. 

3). I see TRAC getting to $2 a lot sooner than I see NEO getting to 1,000+. 

So obviously I feel pretty good about it in many ways, but I’m also fairly new to crypto and want to ask you guys who may have a little more experience than me for your opinions. 

I’m not naive and thinking it will hit $2 in two months or anything. I guess I’m just thinking that my potential return on TRAC could be much greater than with the neo I have, given I bought it around $100, since TRAC should have a ton of room to grow. Any thoughts?

**1. Dev Team**

Do they have faces online? LinkedIn or some other professional biography? Go check out the team page on OT's website. Every single one of them has a LinkedIn Profile. Their reputations are front and center; and there is a face and work history to every name. That's important. Check it out yourself: https://origintrail.io/#team

**2. Longevity/history**

*Edit: it's been brought to my attention that OT implemented blockchain in late 2016. Thus, despite their track record of tracing organic beef starting in 2013, they didn't start using blockchain until late 2016/very early 2017.*

Teams working on a project for a longer period are more likely to stick with the project.

You may not know this, but OT has been working on their product since 2013 and became operational in 2015. Oh, that doesn't sound that exciting to you? Let me rephrase that, OT has been working on their product longer than Ethereum. You heard me.

Ethereum was first *proposed* in December of 2013 by Vitalik Buterin. OriginTrail has been tracking organic beef since before Vitalik even proposed ETH. Let that sink in for a moment.

**3. Actually solving a need in the market**

One of the first questions I ask myself about a coin/token is, ""What does this coin/token do? Is there a need/demand for it?"" OT is pretty clear in the problem they want to solve. Supply chain data is fragmented and difficult to track. In the supply industry, this is a notorious problem. OT wants to end that, or at least make it much more manageable not by creating their own blockchain, but by making already existing and future blockchains interoperable.

In case you missed it, OT can track beef, dairy, vegetables, wine, and other food products from the farm to the shelf. To give an idea of fraud in food supply chains, 70% of wine in China is fake: https://cpianalysis.org/2017/01/16/fake-wine-in-china/

33% of fish in the USA is mislabled: http://www.wsj.com/video/beware-of-fake-fish-in-restaurants-and-seafood-shops/BF80613A-22B5-4909-BF43-0A01DEE3287A.html

76% of honey in the USA doesn't pass FDA standards for actually being called ""Honey"": https://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-schiffman/most-store-bought-honey-i_b_1118564.html

If you think that people don't really care about any of that, or the traceability of food, check out this Fast Company article: https://www.fastcompany.com/3063134/food-safety-track-and-trace-data

TL;DR of that article: not tracking food properly leads to disease, illness, or death. If you didn't know, those are bad for business. Once the public finds out, they vote with their dollars and stop spending money on those products.

**4. Potentially revolutionizing/leading their niche**

Let's be real, OT is creating the first fully blockchain agnostic supply side crypto. This means that any company can build on any blockchain. China can use NEO; Korea can use ICX; USA can use ETH, then there are a slew of others like IOTA, VEN, WTC, MOD, etc, plus an enterprise (like IBM with Walmart) can even build their own in-house blockchain and still use OT while also throwing out an award to OT for food safety innovation in the process (wink, wink). I can't state enough how massive this is. If OT is successful, you're going to see some major partnerships with other blockchains, huge supply chain enterprises, and of course little guys too that want to prove their product, such as a vineyard, against some global companies. It's what can give them an edge in the market to say, ""We know exactly where the fruit to this wine came from, and we can prove it with the simple scan of our GS1 standardaized barcode that pulls from the only GS1 compliant blockchain protocol (OriginTrail).""

**5. Actual need for the token**

This is pretty high on my list; I generally start with this one actually. If there isn't a need for the token, then I am not interested.

TRAC is crucial for the protocol to even function; without it, supply chains won't be able to send, store, and retrieve data. How will that happen? Nodes, duh! In a decentralized world, something has to be sending information and validating it; welcome to nodes on the OT protocol.

I'm highly interested in the node requirements, as well as the reward distribution; I can't wait for the node announcement in the next 30-90 days. If they find a financially happy medium for masternodes, or whatever staking mechanism they choose, look out, because people want those masternodes.

To quote the whitepaper directly:

*""The Trace token is the means of compensation between supply chain data producers and data consumers on one side and the OriginTrail node holders on the other. It provides the
incentive to the nodes in the peer to peer network to perform the system functionalities.""*

Read section 4.6 of the whitepaper to learn more:https://origintrail.io/storage/documents/OriginTrail-White-Paper.pdf

I think this token is just like the early days of ICX, NEO, and the like. I don't know if it will ever be a top 25 coin. Hell, I don't know anything really.

However, with staking announcements coming in the next 30-90 days, testnet in June, mainnet in Q3, and a whole lot in between, I think TRAC has one of the best chances out of all of crypto to meet their goals and skyrocket in value in 2018.

I'm not in the game of price predictions, but I do think early adopters will be handsomely rewarded.","","81w3f2",NA,0,NA,"false",1522428480,"false","self","t5_3nyqu","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/OriginTrail/comments/81w3f2/i_like_coins_that_meet_5_key_requirements_ot_hits/","","",NA,"","",0,1

""The incentive model presented is flexible and allows for everyone to set up the parameters for themselves to make their nodes profitable. A market bidding system will be further detailed in the following releases. Staking is necessary to ensure the security and stability of the network and it will be set per agreement, not as a large continuous stake. It’s a different type of incentive system because the protocol is different than the blockchain. In the blockchain, every node has a copy of the whole blockchain. In our solution, every node has a different set of data, so not every node can check another node. This enables flexibility of the OriginTrail Decentralized Network and the needed scale.""



""The Trace token is the glue of the system. Decentralized networks need something to bring them together and enable the network effects. The token brings together the entire network. The utility of the token is focused on the protocol level where it delivers the value. Cases can be developed on top of the protocol.

You have already found one of the most beautiful projects in the crypto landscape! Perhaps you have already invested in it. Perhaps you are still considering it. Anyway. You have found a promising project with an incredible amount of potential!


OriginTrail is a long-term investment. The true value of the Trace token will arise when the mainnet is launched. Unfortunately, the value is currently subject to movements that have nothing to do with the quality of OriginTrail. Keep in mind that the market can price things wrong. In the future the value will be based on companies that use the protocol for their supply chain. This creates a completely different demand for TRAC. Not only that. Everyone is free to develop applications on top of the protocol. Demand for TRAC is also created through the use of these applications. And of course there are the nodes that keep the network running. On the one hand TRAC will be parked on the nodes. On the other hand, nodes ensure that TRAC is put into circulation through smart contracts.


Some advice. Try to imagine the future value. Make your own forecast. Do not be fooled by fluctuations that have nothing to do with quality of the OriginalTrail. The following aspects are important:



Knowledge, experience and execution power of the team

As for the developers. Everything that is delivered is open source. Everyone can check the quality of the code and provide feedback. Everyone is free to test it. As for the management and staff members. They have organized several sessions where they answer all questions live. They show that they are capable and also have a clear vision. Also in terms of being representative and strong in communication. A good example is when COO Ziga Drev gave an explanation on national television:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajrt3fGe-CU

People from OriginTrail are involved and continuously active on the social media to speak to people and answer questions. 



A strong network

Take a look at the OriginTrail advisors. Those are people with a track record!  Also do not forget that OriginTrail has been active since 2013 and therefore has acquired knowledge of the market and a network. 


Partnerships

More than 70 companies and other interested parties have joined the Trace Alliance and the number is growing. These representatives are already working and thinking to make the Ecosystem successful. For example:
http://www.btc.si/en/press-releases/2018/03/btc-company-moves-closer-toward-implementation-blockchain-technology/

https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-now-integrates-data-from-forensic-laboratories-with-the-blockchain-1e635eb54350



Honour the commitments 

So far, OriginTrail realized all steps from the roadmap on time! They have a clear and sharp vision. Important choices are based on that.



A product that solves problems

There is a lot fragmentation of data in siloes and opacity of supply chains. None of the current solutions provides high performant functionalities of storing, processing and interacting with highly interconnected data that is inherent to supply chains. The OriginTrail protocol tackles this problem. 
Their ideas have already been rewarded by Wallmart.



A product that creates value

OriginTrail is an Ecosystem where all kinds of different actors come together. It is not just companies from the supply chain that connect. Also third parties can develop applications on top of the protocol and offer these to supply chain companies, other companies, government or end users. As mentioned in the white paper: product authentication / product journey visibility / product recall efficiency / product freshness for perishables / chain of custody with accountability / CSR activities support / supply chain mapping and optimization / inventory management / alert systems (exception management) / supply chain compliance assurance / customs, audit and regulations process optimization and any other supply chain application that requires transparent supply chain as a starting point. 

It’s an open system. Think about it. Companies like SAP, Accenture, IBM, PwC, etc. can use the protocol and also benefit and integrate it in their products and proposition. I would not be surprised if these type of companies is also connected to the Trace Alliance. They would be crazy if they did not.



Risks

Of course there are also risks. The product has yet to be further developed and tested. That still involves major challenges. And then we still have to wait that it will actually be used by companies. It is nice to know that more and more interested companies are joining the alliance and that they stay connected and interested. Maybe you wonder ""What about the competition?”. But how can a system that is open and available to everyone be competitive?  It’s not. It is complementary. It’s an Ecosystem that every company or entity can use. Maybe you wonder “What about other blockchain platforms like VeChain, Walton or IBM Hyperledger?”. OriginTrail is not a blockchain platform. It’s a protocol and decentralized database with all kinds of extra functionality. It’s blockchain agnostic. That means that it can be linked and integrated with different blockchain platforms by choice.  For example, companies themselves can make a combination of IBM hyperledger and OriginTrail for their solution. Or companies like SAP could use the protocol to enrich their own products.



Think not ""what can TRAC do for you, but what you can do for TRAC"" 


Help each other understand the OriginTrail Ecosystem. The OriginTrail Ecosystem is easy to understand in general terms. But if you go deeper into it, there are also many complex aspects. Perhaps you have already thoroughly studied the matter. The channels such as telegram, reddit, rocket chat enable you to transfer this knowledge to others. On the other hand, if there are still aspects that are unclear to you, dare to ask the question. Other community members are happy to help answer that question or to refer you to certain documentation. Is certain documentation unclear? Let the community know. That is also valuable feedback. 


But there are more things you can do. You can help testing a testnode. Maybe you can write well. Write an article. Graphic designer? Create an infographic sheet. Are you a programmer? Help reviewing the code. Are you in supply chain business? Think about uses cases or how OriginTrail can help your business and share it on rocket chat So you are a Lean Six Sigma expert or a process manager? Think about which DApps are useful. For example, a DApp to automatically generate a Value Stream Map over the supply chain or a neat idea to benchmark a supply chain using OT protocol and data. Maybe you are a finance specialist. Think about DApps to create financial reports over the supply chain data. You are in software development? Build a DApp and make some profit. Whatever you do, share your ideas!


Conclusion

OriginTrail is a great project. There is a strong team behind it. The future possibilities are very versatile. It actually solves a problem and creates value. It is an investment for the long term. Make a forecast and a plan and stick to it. Do not be fooled by the prevailing crypto craziness. It is about the future value. Visualize the horizon. Participate in a great community. Last but not least. It's not just about the money. With OriginTrail we create a better and more beautiful world.

I wish you and your family and loved ones a merry easter.

Have I done something wrong, or does it just take time? Any assistance much appreciated.","","81sdfr",NA,0,NA,"false",1522426381,"false","self","t5_3nyqu","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/OriginTrail/comments/81sdfr/help_with_idex_deposit/","","",NA,"","",0,0

The observant among you will notice the release names coincide with notable achievements within a range of space programmes:

**Luna** Release v0.3a - March 12th
&gt;The Luna programme (from the Russian word Луна ""Luna"" meaning ""Lunar"" or ""Moon""), occasionally called Lunik or Lunnik by western media, was a series of robotic spacecraft missions sent to the Moon by the Soviet Union between 1959 and 1976. 

**Mechta** Release v0.4a - March 26th
&gt;Luna 1, also known as Mechta, E-1 No.4 and First Lunar Rover, was the first spacecraft to reach the vicinity of the Earth's Moon, and the first spacecraft to be placed in heliocentric orbit.

**Ranger** Release v0.5a  - April 9th
&gt;The Ranger program was a series of unmanned space missions by the United States in the 1960s whose objective was to obtain the first close-up images of the surface of the Moon. 

**Kosmos** Release v0.6a - April 23th
&gt;The first Soviet satellites orbiting Earth were named Sputnik, Polyot (starting in 1963), Elektron (in 1964), Proton (in 1965), and Molniya (in 1965), but most have been called Kosmos since Kosmos 1 in 16 March 1962. The program has included unmanned tests of manned spacecraft and satellites for scientific research and military purposes.

**Zond** Release v0.7a - May 7th
&gt;Zond was the name given to two distinct series of Soviet unmanned space program undertaken from 1964 to 1970. The first series, based on the 3MV planetary probe, was intended to gather information about nearby planets.

**Surveyor** Release v0.8a - May 21st
&gt;The Surveyor program was a NASA program that, from June 1966 through January 1968, sent seven robotic spacecraft to the surface of the Moon. Its primary goal was to demonstrate the feasibility of soft landings on the Moon

**Explorer** Release v0.9a - June 4th
&gt;Explorer 1 was the first satellite of the United States, launched as part of its participation in the International Geophysical Year. The mission followed the first two satellites the previous year; the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1 and 2, beginning the Cold War Space Race between the two nations.

**Lunar Orbiter** Release v1.0b-RC - June 18th
&gt;The Lunar Orbiter program was a series of five unmanned lunar orbiter missions launched by the United States from 1966 through 1967. Intended to help select Apollo landing sites by mapping the Moon's surface,[1] they provided the first photographs from lunar orbit.

TESTNET **Apollo** Release v1.0b - June 29th
&gt;The Apollo program, also known as Project Apollo, was the third United States human spaceflight program carried out by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which accomplished landing the first humans on the Moon from 1969 to 1972.

FYI this is just something that jumped out to me as interesting. But I do like the contextual nature of it: from unknown exploration with a significant known risk of destruction, to orbiting to landing. 

And it’s nice to see something more than the vanilla naming of releases.","","81id0s",NA,0,NA,"false",1522244904,"false","self","t5_3nyqu","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/OriginTrail/comments/81id0s/origintrail_new_detailed_dev_roadmap_mewn/","","",NA,"","",0,0

*Hi everyone,*

*Thanks for all the questions on the Telegram AMA yesterday (28. 3. 2018 at 17 UTC).*
*Thank you very much for submitting your opinions and feedback throughout the channels.*

*Since we highly value it, we believe we need a better process for allowing community members to express their opinions and submit improvement proposals to the project. Therefore we are going to introduce an easy improvement proposal submission system early next week where we can publicly discuss each of the proposals together with the rest of the community. We kindly invite you to participate in this and help us find the optimal solutions that are a common goal for all of us.*

*Below is a list of all the questions and answers from the AMA. The common goal is to remove these (valid) concerns and find a solution that fits both the technical needs as well as the needs of the stakeholders.*

**Daniel Shapiro: Could there be a simpler way to explain this incentive model? Maybe with an example? I'm still surprised how complicated this has been made to sound. Hence why so many people have been put off**

Branimir Rakic: We are looking at how to explain it in a more practical example, but for that, we will also add more details about the bidding mechanism which is coming up in April. I know the document is highly technical, but unfortunately so is the subject of the matter.

**Bob: I understand that when you did your research into the best system of use you considered DPOS but did not go with it. Could you please explain your rationale here, because from my point of view DPOS is superior in every single facet and helps alleviate some of the issues with the current POS method. 
1. By voting for delegates you ensure quality of the network and democracy; the cream will rise to the top.
2. By having delegates, these people will use superior VPS with high-uptime and significantly reduce any possible loss of stake. 
3. It will encourage easy staking for those less technical minded who don’t want to engage the services of third parties in order to stake their coins; i.e. do you think someone with 100 trac would really utilise AWS, or could be bothered? This way, people are incentivised to hold and will receive proportionate shares of profits. 
4. The community WILL ALWAYS be involved. You alienate NO ONE. The current method alienates the common person.
The proposed POS method may be perfect for yourself and like-minded people, but I can seriously only see this going one way- towards more centralisation not less, people will be alienated and disenfranchised and you can’t tell me network capability is more safeguarded by the average person following a google doc than by an experienced operator such as a delegate. It reminds me a little of communism- great in theory, but in practice the power gravitates to the hands of the few.**

Branimir: We did consider DPoS options but for a system solving problems of the nature OriginTrail is solving we found it not to be the optimal solution. DPoS can be great when maintaining global state (like in blockchains) though we have a different set of problems for which the delegated voting doesn't fit. As in blockchains, you could deterministically verify a double spend, and the voting is used to determine the ""right chain"". What is deterministic in OriginTrail is the integrity of data involved in the agreements between two parties, which is a different set of problems and ideally solvable without the need for voting. That is why the stake is possible to be determined by the involved parties themselves, as well as the agreement on required uptime and token compensation for the service. This system is therefore very enabling and allows for everyone to participate, it enforces decentralization and is made to support the services that the OriginTrail network needs to provide

&gt; Follow up remark by Bob: Ok. The solution to the issue you identified is to empower delegates with greater authority, something which will grow organically over time as they prove themselves to the community- which as a democracy will cause the best players to succeed on a medium term timeline. 
TBH your answer doesn’t really address my major concerns, and through this method, I can see small players/non-technically minded people being quickly alienated which will result in centralization as well as an unstable network as a whole.

&gt;&gt; Follow up remark by Branimir: I would disagree on the alienation, rather see it as empowerment. The technical knowledge will be a plus, but one would be able to run a node without being a developer in a capacity of potentially lower token income but significantly less risk too.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Bob: Sure, but I would call that cognitive bias due to your technical background. It's important to think from a layman perspective, the audience is here and I guarantee the sentiment is more in line with my own.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Branimir: Bob thanks for the feedback and expressing your sentiment, it is really valuable to us. I can understand your position so let me try to explain in a bit more detail now that we have some more time. 
It is absolutely the idea to protect the interest of the “layman” as you put it, by empowering them to engage with the system in the same way as more technical players. It seems that we just have different opinions on the method that protects them better. One important thing to note which was left out of yesterday’s AMA is the actual possibility of the delegated voting in the system and what it may create. To have a fair system, when a node is tested and data doesn’t add up, the system needs to have an undisputed (mathematical) way of proving which side is trying to game the system. In this case, the only side who has the actual (original form) of data is the DC node which sent the data to the DH node that it has an agreement with. Practically only the node with the original data can verify data on other nodes. In theory, if this data is sent to some chosen delegates, the first problem is they would also have to hold all this data on their nodes, which is very burdening as they would need to keep all the data from the network in several replications, limiting the capacity of the network to the capacity of delegates. This is one of the major problems we have set ourselves to solving in the first place (scaling). Another problem is that the authority of the decision would be transferred to voting for one or the other side and in that way having the ability to collude and vote in the delegates highest interest, rather than the truth. 
You are probably right about the technical bias you mentioned, but I must assure you that this bias in not due to some personal preferences (or dislike to DPoS as a system), but only because technically this approach solves the problems without the possibility of collusion and scaling issues. Having that said, we are more than willing to hear and review all different community proposals (which is why we are opening the new proposal channel of communication, as mentioned above). Please submit any improvement ideas or changes you believe will benefit the system and let’s continue the discussion there.

**Bob: Have you thought about the temporary use of centralized nodes for organizations..I.e. in order to use the protocol you have to lock up x amounts of tokens to be used..**

Branimir: We are committed to building a decentralized system which prevents data manipulation even if the companies along the supply chain would agree to do so (e.g. to cover up an inconsistency), so the idea of a closed, centralized system is not on our roadmap.

**Josh K.: I'm having trouble understanding how this staking model evens the playing field. It seems to take the little guy out of the equation as most do not know how to set up a VPS to avoid potential loss or their return may not even be worth setting one up.**

Branimir: The uptime issue seems to concern a lot of people so let’s try to explain in a little more practical way. It is absolutely not the idea to allow losing of funds for a brief, unexpected amount of time due to a potential power outage or similar. The system accounts for this via the ability to set up the comfortable level of uptime per period of time, and it is not designed to penalize a one-time outage. For a longer period of not providing the service, or providing tampered data the penalty makes sense. This will be explained in further detail in the coming weeks. Also, the technical difficulty of setting up a node will be minimized by providing an easy way to install it both on a local machine as well as on a VPS.

**Josh K: So as a person that does not feel comfortable setting up a VPS to hopefully avoid chance of losing my tokens I guess this leaves me out. As Bob stated this alienates a (potentially) large base of the community and that's exactly how I myself fee, alienated from investing any more in the project. The price dip on this news seems to reflect that sentiment across the board. Not an attack, just a statement.**

Branimir: Please see the discussion above.

**Florent: Will it be possible for an agreement to run several nodes in the same time?
Is it possible have several nodes working for 1 agreement? It would allow small holders to get involved in big deals.**

Branimir: Absolutely, this is exactly one of the mechanisms to provide very high uptime, regardless of technical abilities of a single node. Multiple nodes involved in one agreement provide for higher stability and a very low probability of downtime if set up correctly (i.e. not having 3 PCs in one house connected to the same power outlet, rather physically dispersed). This allows for small players to join efforts and participate in big deals.

**Code05: Can 1 node run several agreements at the same time?
Do agreements get picked automatically or are there manual actions needed everytime you start an agreement?**

Branimir: No manual actions, the nodes communicate between themselves frequently and determine if they are a ""fit"" for the agreement, which is then established in the smart contract. And yes, the idea is to run many agreements at once.

**Gerhard: I think the people who use the network will specify which blockchain can store the fingerprints and the level of security/trust in the SLA**
**Based on the latter the nodes probably get picked by their reputation which consists of the collateral and history as a good actor**

Branimir: Great thinking. This is exactly the system what we committed to making.

**CressiDave: So what if I am a bad DC... I add data to your DH then proceed to DDOS you?**

Branimir: This is a very good question and are building the system to take such possibilities into account. This is why the cost of requests in the system needs to be high enough to discourage DDoS attacks, as well as to allow the DH to submit the litigation proof to the smart contract even if it experiences potential overwhelm. We will be releasing more information on the system mechanics which will further address this topic.

**Dave Mc: What prevents malicious actions from the DP/DC to try and obtain agreement stake?**

Branimir: The DP/DC needs to prove that for a certain predetermined data set and fingerprint stored on the blockchain (which is available before the initiation of the agreement) it has a Merkle Proof, challenge and answers that the DH cannot answer themselves. If the DC tries to fix a false challenge and Merkle proof for it, combined with the answer it will not match the initial fingerprint on the blockchain, hence it will lose the dispute. 

**Dave Mc: ""integrity of data involved in the agreements between two parties"". If agreement is one-to-many - in terms of redundant storage - are several agreements formed to create the redundant storage solution?**

Branimir: It is flexible - One-to-one and one-to-many scenarios are both valid, depending on what the nodes strategy is. The answers above clarify more on this topic.

**Dave Mc: Is peer-to-peer really decentralised?**

Branimir: The decentralization comes from the distribution of data in the system to different parties as well as how the system makes decisions, which are based on objective proofs and smart contracts handling them (blockchain), rather than peer-to-peer voting or human-centric decision making. 

**SnapperWhippet: How are bad actors defined? Is it only downtime that might result in loss of stake?**

Branimir: A bad actor is essentially someone who would tamper with data or try to prove that they are storing something they are not.

**SnapperWhippet: Maybe a silly question, but could a company requiring verification not buy their own node separately and sell service to themselves? (i.e under a different entity, thus gaming the market)**

Branimir: This is actually not a silly question at all, rather a valid point and why the system needs decentralization in the first place. To mitigate this potential problem the bidding process allows for anyone to apply for agreements offered by the company’s node (data provider). The decision about which nodes will get the agreements is not up to the company’s node though, rather on the system which trustlessly picks the candidates via the smart contract.

**Aeras Crypt: Will there be anything incorporated into the current incentive model to stabilize the token economy? At the current point in time, I don't see what would convince a heavy TRAC holder from otherwise selling his tokens following massive gains; he can simply sell his 100,000 for fiat and then buy back 100,000 at no cost/loss of privileges. Unless reputation penalties are incorporated into this scenario and I am simply mistaken?**

Branimir: Very good question and partially answered by yourself already. It is actually very similar to other models as it comes to stake, it’s just that stake gets accumulated per agreement (which are many at the same time) and not staked upfront “in one shot”. Therefore in order to maintain receiving rewards for services the stake has to stay put, unless one wants to lose reputation (and rewards) by selling it.

**Turbo 3000: Can holders who are not interested in setting up a node or maintaining a node stake their coins at all by delegating their coins?**

Branimir: Yes, there is no obstacle to delegating coins. There are several collaboration scenarios, see the answers above. 

**Turbo 3000: is there any incentive to hold TRAC without setting up a node?**

Branimir: This has been addressed by several answers above.

**Florent: In the DH competition will it be a way to ensure rewards and protect the small DH from the biggest with a lot of capacities and good reputation capable to push the prices down and make money with volume?**

Branimir: We are going to present the detailed mechanism next month with focus on this problem, so to provide for a fair market and to avoid centralization.

**Code05: I read a lot of questions about what happens when your VPC (and node) has an unexpected downtime. What are the thresholds for these kinds of downtime? And what happens when your node is down longer than this value?**

Branimir: The idea with downtime is to handle it per agreement, being able to agree on this as well. This would let nodes with more guaranteed uptime charge a higher fee.

&gt; Follow up question: What would you consider a high guaranteed uptime?

&gt;&gt; Follow up answer: Now that we have more time a bit more info on this - the topic of uptime is more complex but simplifying it here. It is up to the DH to provide a range of parameters that influence the agreements (price per data unit, time parameters, requirements for the track record of their partners), which together with it’s previous reputation form a basis for the decision of what a guaranteed uptime for them can be. If uptime is an important factor for the data provider it can be satisfied by setting up a robust system, introducing several nodes instead of one in the agreement and provide virtually 100% uptime (see answers above).

**Dave Mc: Would there be any interest at OT for a community inclusive test group to trial different staking protocols to see what works best? My thought is that it would run separate from the current dev build and allow tests to see how models work as well as testing system and protocol limitations.**

Branimir: Absolutely, as per our roadmap you may notice that we have allocated Q3 for the testnet for real time testing on a larger scale. We are happy to see if the community provides alternative builds and would like to see them submitted as improvement proposals (mentioned above).

**Josh K: Pretty please address Bob’s excellent concern in your responses. A lot of us are concerned about the announced model alienating the little guy from participating at all. I was also curious if the team will take the community reaction to the announced model into consideration at all. The majority of the community does not appear to be behind this model one bit.**

Branimir: We are very glad to have a community that is so devoted to making sure the system is made properly and invite everyone to participate in discussions and improvement proposals. Please see above answers to Bob’s questions.

**Dave Mc: Litigation process: would a consensus model be better than the current thinking of a peer-to-peer test.**

Branimir: Please see the response to Bob’s question above regarding the validation in the litigation process and why consensus vote is not appropriate.

**Martijn Veerman: The Data Holder will also have to deposit a stake in the amount proportional to the amount of the job value. How is the amount of this stake determined?**

Branimir: The amount is based on the agreement the DH and DC make which is based on market conditions and requirements from the DC. Everybody can set their own terms and nodes with matching terms will form agreements in the market.

**Dave Mc: Is a deprecated version of Kademlia the best solution to the node system management?**

Branimir: Absolutely not :), we are in the process of refactoring and implementing the up-to-date version of Kademlia in April.

**Jeff Courtney: Can u give some insight on the hardware required to run a high quality node? Would a NAS (network-attached storage) server/box be sufficient?**

Branimir: We are early in the stage of development to give more precise estimates on the hardware requirements, but we do not expect a need for very demanding hardware as in i.e. proof-of-work type of systems. We’ve actually been running a local node in the office on a Raspberry Pi for testing, but at this stage without the fully fledged node.

**Arnold: Many people seem to be upset about potentially losing tokens when staking. Is there, technically speaking, a possibility to address these concerns and make the penalty for being a bad actor (due to downtime) more bearable for stakers? This seems necessary as many people are now unwilling to risk their stake.**

Branimir: Please take a look at the previous answers, but I want to point out that the whole idea is exactly that the system is capable of differentiating between malicious behavior and unintentional drops. Be assured that we are very aware of the need to protect the system stakeholders and will gear the model in the direction to completely diminish this kind of concern.","","880vq2",NA,0,NA,"false",1522374733,"false","self","t5_3nyqu","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/OriginTrail/comments/880vq2/march_28_telegram_ama_with_cto_branimir_rakić/","","",NA,"","",0,0

For the last month or so I've invested in OT, and I think this project is one of the most interesting ones in the crypto space. Different ideas is swirring around in my head at all times, and I would like to get your opinion on something. 

What about a rating system in the OriginTrail trace-app (as seen in the promo videos about e.g greek yogurt or meat). 

Example: 
You've had dinner, you've eaten a steak, you rate the steak (different measures, whatever fits the product best). This information is then given back to the farms and of course the OT-team. The producer of the food would then know what the customers liked and disliked about their product.

You could see how many times each ticket had been sold and possibly for what price which would make it impossible to hide who is at fault in the second hand ticket mark up.

He makes some very important points that are essential to improving supply chain trust but which OT seems to ignore. The response he got by a team member was fairly generic and dismissive of his points. Can anyone address his concerns? How will OT verify data input is accurate? How will companies with multiple suppliers update all of their unique identifiers if they change suppliers? Hope to see some response from the team beyond ""outside our scope"".

From an investing perspective, there is generally obvious value to the token as businesses are heavily incentivized to run nodes to secure the network. Because of this the majority of my portfolio has been in Vechain and Walton. However, with all the poor management from Waltonchain with the Valentine's Day contest to the website to generally terrible communication, I'm thinking of moving a good bit of WTC to TRAC. Anyone else in the same boat?

My thinking is OriginTrail has a very strong, well rounded team that's been working in this sector since before Ethereum was even a thing. Their communication has been night and day better than Walton's. They've gotten huge recognition in terms of the awards from Walmart and Food + City. They've already started promising pilot projects and there seems to be a lot of interest in OT from companies that have yet to be announced. While their partnerships aren't at the level of Waltons yet, I think a big distinguishing factor is OT can be an additional layer on existing supply chain systems whereas Walton is a full replacement.

Besides these factors, OT is 1/10 of the marketcap of WTC. It's only on really small exchanges. Master node details are coming soon and will surely lead people to accumulate to the number of TRAC needed to run one. They've already adopted GS1 standards with plans for more like USDA. Plus, they have plans to be active in Europe, Asia, and North America. And it's not talked about much because their current focus is food/agriculture, but OT will work across sectors.

Basically I think a lot of good things are coming for this project and it's much easier to trust the team than others like Walton.

The title pretty much says everything. Recently I was checking out the roadmap and found that trac has partnered with SAP. I've been researching about this coin, accumulating a handful pretty much every week. One thing the roadmap doesn't talk about is it's partnership with SAP. SAP is arguably the leading ERP company and what else can be the best partner of a community that focuses on supply chain?! 

I'm really bullish on trac after knowing that it had partnered with SAP. Could anyone share more information about this partnership?

Any information will be greatly appreciated.

The system isn't exactly like other well known coins but almost a combination of with an OriginTrail twist. Branimir is the CTO of OriginTrail and he was good enough to join us in Telegram to answer some community questions after the announcement.


INTRO - Branimir Rakic OriginTrail:

Hey guys, trying to summarize your questions here and make it a bit easier to understand.

The staking involved is to minimize the potential of bad play in exchanging data between the DC and DH nodes. It is set per agreement. Each of the agreements between the nodes is compensated in TRAC, and if the agreement doesn't go through it gets cancelled (the DH gets what it earned up to that point). In order to make the breaking of agreements less attractive, the stake is there to discourage both sides to do bad play.
The DC and DH agree upon what the stakes are in the game for a certain agreement, depending on the amount of TRAC for that agreement. Since each node will have many ongoing agreements, this means different amounts to stake for each of the agreements. 

Since agreements have a time boundary, if everything goes well, this stake is then released back to the node and can be reused in another agreemnt. 
As the data provider or node owner, one can choose the parameters they feel will perform well in the market for them, meaning the price per data unit, required stake and reputation. The source of gain is the agreed upon sum in the smart contract for the agreement, and the stake is a guarantee that a node will fulfill it's part of the agreement. Having that said, there cannot be a fixed minimum for the stake, as it will be a function of the agreements and the needs of the market between DH and DC nodes.

Q1) Mick Egan:

Do you think this model will allow big consumers to manipulate the market.

Say a large international wants to use trac they buy a massive amount and set their limit at 1 million trac, and basically pay them selves to run their high end node because note many wallets would stake that volume?

Number could be higher just pick a mill

A1) Branimir Rakic OriginTrail:
Good question, thanks Mick. Because anyone can join and create their node (both DH and DC), having a large player set a high requirement for their stake will not influence any of the others ability to set a low / market value amount for their agreement stake and price. It's a matching mechanism, where a node that requires a high stake for an agreement needs to pair up with a node which wants to offer such a high stake. But it doesn't stop anyone else from doing agreements in the amounts they feel comfortable with

Q2) Mewn Ball:
So you can stake with 1 trac, 1000 trac or 1M trac and the % you gain will remain the same irrespective of no. of staked trac? Or will the percent level rise with the amount and if so what would the formula be? What would be the difference of a node staking 100 trac and the one staking 100k trac ceteris paribus (assuming the same level of non foul history)?

A2) Branimir Rakic OriginTrail:
Please refer to my summary (intro) above. The gain is strictly tied to the agreements


Q3) SnapperWhipper:
I have a question - regarding reputation. Can it be explained a bit further how that might be defined? Is that for example a node that has been in action for a period of time, or number of transactions? And with that reputation, the incentive increases? So, a very large node with a great reputation will be largely rewarded and so incentivise holding long term?

A3) Branimir Rakic OriginTrail:
The reputation comes from the previous historical record - in simplest terms, it's a function how many tokens have not been transferred according to agreements (cause they went south). So a node active for a period of time and a good player will have a higher reputation than someone new and ""unproven"", thus being more attractive on the market for services

Q4) Lucas D:
Are the rewards nonlinear in terms of Trac staked?

A4) Branimir Rakic OriginTrail:
The rewards are agreed upon between nodes in advance, depending on the market conditions. Once again, the stake is there to discourage breaking of agreements, which is unwanted behaviour in the network.

Q5) Igor Muževič:
So the way I see it, tiered system would be more beneficial to the current price rise, while the suggested system will be much more beneficial to the whole system, because much more ppl will be incentivized to stake and thus contribute to security and also ppl will be stimulated to actively participate to raise their reputation and thus their holding. Is this correct?

A5) Branimir Rakic OriginTrail:
The proposed incentive model is the one to provide long term stability of the network and has a very low probability of diverging into a centralized system, or a system where bad players can get ahead. It incentivises everyone to run a high quality node so to speak, which requires the amount of stake proportional to the amount of work the node is performing, which is, if I am not mistaking, what you have stated ��

Q6) Lucas D:
I think the reward is a function of three things: 
1.) how many TRAC are put up to 'guarantee' the transaction
2.) how reputable your node is for completings txs
3.) how quickly you can complete txs

A6) Branimir Rakic OriginTrail:
thanks for the question Lucas. 
I'd like to point out that we are not talking about Txs here, as the OT network is not a blockchain. It is a service network based on agreements between nodes, which provide the services to each other. The stake is a guarantee for the agreement, the reputation comes from well done agreements in the past and you set a price for the services (agreements) of your node yourself. It is a market where each actor gets to decide the price and how well they want to perform and risk loosing tokens

Q7) flipdrago:
I would like to present an analogy for this model. Can't we compare this to owning a restaurant? The number of tokens we stake equates to the number of ""tables"" we have at our restaurant. The more we stake, the more tables we can serve customers at. Once customers leave, they leave positive reviews (e.g. Yelp reviews) which will attract more customers.

A7) Branimir Rakic OriginTrail:
In a simplified manner this can be seen as an analogy, yes. Though the number of tables would also need to represent the computing power, hard drive space and networking capabilities of the node, which are all limited, as well as the amount of tokens one owns.

Q8) flipdrago:
Can people just keep undercutting each other then (to secure staking agreements on the network)?

A8) Branimir Rakic OriginTrail:
The option of undercutting is mitigated by the bidding mechanism which involves the smart contract picking the nodes which satisfy the criteria presented by the DC. It selects an amount of DH nodes which are in a certain range of the median price, so if technically somebody offers a very low price trying to undercut too much, they will most likely be left out of the choice. Again, this depends on the criteria very much. We will be providing more details on this mechanism in the coming releases

Q9.a) Dr. Maximus:
Who determines if you lose the TRAC stakes? And if so, who can take it form you? Where does it go?

A9.a) Branimir Rakic OriginTrail:
The smart contract determines who loses the stake, depending on if they can prove they have provided the service. This is explained pretty well in the incentive model document, please see the Testing and Litigation paragraphs

Q9.b) Dr. Maximus:
Thanks for pointing me in the right direction. I read further. As I can tell it’s a check and balance system between DH and DC, in which both can actively “challenge” the data content in order to claim possession of the staked TRAC. (If they believe the data is not being stored or created by the node that entered the smart contract)

A9.b) Branimir Rakic OriginTrail:
Yes, the DC can challenge the DH at any time to provide proof of service in that particular moment. If the DH doesn't respond with a valid proof, they stand to loose the stake. On the other hand if the DC decides to try and send a malicious test which the DH cannot provide proof for, the contract can determine this and have the DC loose stake

Q10) solotigre:
I assume this agreement is handled automatically via smart contract based on the parameters the DP and DH set in the node software. Is that correct?

A10) Branimir Rakic OriginTrail:
that is true. More details are in the incentive model doc, see the ""Service period"" section

Q11) Arnold:
How does the reputation system work tho, wouldnt this give a big advantage to early investors as they get more time to build up reputation ?

A11) Branimir Rakic OriginTrail:
Good question Arnold, thanks. The reputation will take into account the elapsed time. Simplified, the agreements that are in the near past are weighted more than the ones further in the past, therefore not having a simple linear equation where a node could live off of ""old fame"". It set so that it motivates every node to provide a high quality service all the time, which is required to keep the quality of the whole network at the needed level

Q12.a) Luke MacDonald:
Have you addressed the issue of liquidity? I.e. this model is great in the fact that everyone can participate to secure the network, however TRAC is a utility token first and foremost. People need the tokens to use it. It's conceivable that if there are too many tokens locked up that liquidity to actually use the token on the network becomes an issue.

Have you addressed this as yet or will further ideas need to be looked at in regards to this?

A12.a) Branimir Rakic OriginTrail:
Thanks for the question Luke. We are performing tests on the system, simulating the network to observe if such things are possible and are looking for feedback like this. In terms of liquidity this system gives good ground for not having a major amount of tokens locked up, rather the amount that corresponds to the agreement amounts (it is unlikely that for an agreement value of a couple of hundred TRAC someone stakes a much larger amount). Once the agreement is over, you can stake the tokens again. So even though the mechanism does lock up a certain amount of tokens, the stake doesn't make a lot of sense if there are not enough tokens for the actual agreements to take place. Still, we are looking into the options and simulating to be certain we are not tilting the system in the wrong direction

Q12.b) Luke MacDonald:
Ah ha, so in actual fact the token lockup only takes place for the period of time that the transaction is taking place on the network?

If so, this would mean that for liquidity to dry up completely (unlikely but possible) transactions would need to take place at the same time and agreements made with holder's of staked coins all at the once which almost inconceivable.

A12.b) Branimir Rakic OriginTrail:
A small correction - the transactions happen when the agreements end (exchange of tokens), but the tokens are locked up during the period of agreement.

Q13) Filip703:
Hi the more I read about the new system the more I love it but stil very new here. Just a basic question, will it be possible to stake on VPS wallet or just on local PC which needs to be online 24/7?

A13) Branimir Rakic OriginTrail:
Hi Filip, thanks for the question. It depends on what kind of agreements the node will be making - i.e. if an agreement last for months, then it will have to provide a very high uptime for this whole period. On the other hand nothing prohibits short agreements, in which case you could theoretically have a node up for a short period of time (i.e. a few days or even hours, which could be your PC) and deliver a service in that period.

Q14) Luke MacDonald:
@flipdrago partly answers question (regarding length of agreements). Seems ""agreements"" can be various times in length.

A14) Branimir Rakic OriginTrail:
Exactly, depening on what is the data lifespan needed for the usecase

I have also rounded up all the questions that didn't have time to be answered and will get those done in another AMA. If you have a question you would like answered about the incentivised nodes please post it below or send it to me in telegram.

Cheers,
Luke MacDonald

We organized community brainstorming and were eager to hear where our community members see the best use cases of the OriginTrail protocol.

We got over 30 use case ideas, great feedback, and the engagement was way beyond our expectations. Awesome job, Tracers!

We were amazed by the suggestions for projects and use cases that our Tracers see would benefit from OriginTrail. As promised, we rewarded the three most promising ideas with an OriginTrail T-shirt:

- jNL shared no less than 6 ideas with us for next implementations, where OriginTrail protocol could verify data authenticity between subjects - ranging from the green energy market and fair trade products to post delivery and second-hand ticket sale.
- jack elaborated on tracking and organizing medications (flu vaccine, hospital stock meds, narcotics): For quality control and risk management, medications are tracked using lot numbers, which enables to quickly follow up with disposal, testing or patient care if a certain lot has adverse reactions or is contaminated. Using the blockchain to quickly identify where each medication from the lot is at a moment in time could be helpful with preventing future adverse reactions which would save patients from being given dangerous medication.
- Mewn_Ball suggested using OriginTrail for commodity transactions and shipment tracking/trading. Potential tie-up of shipment data with the blockchain could also be connected with insurance.

Thanks to everyone who participated!

Do you have any other idea for further implementations of OriginTrail? Share it with the business development team at alliance@origin-trail.com or in the #bizdev channel of our official chat.

We are also busy developing the Trace Alliance - an alliance of companies, developers, and experts that will collaborate on the development of the protocol and will also include implementation partners.","","82iyj5",NA,0,NA,"false",1522265460,"false","self","t5_3nyqu","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/OriginTrail/comments/82iyj5/recap_of_the_first_trace_friday/","","",NA,"","",0,1

Translation of the interview:

Which farms do ingredients for products available in stores come from? A now-well-established Slovene start-up OriginTrail started on its path by asking this very question. The company developed a system of tracing ingredients back to individual farms. Now, the innovative team has gone even further. With the goal of developing an advanced solution and even more applications that enable product traceability, supply chain management, and certifications, they have entered the world of blockchain technologies. In just 18 minutes, they sold 13 million euros worth of their Trace crypto-token, raising 18 million euros overall counting the tokens sold in the presale. Moreover, OriginTrail is the first Non-Chinese company that received an award for a traceability pilot project in China. 

Host: Good evening, Mr. Drev. Can you tell me how you persuaded business partners in China? Everyone dreams of conquering this market with more than a billion consumers with unlimited opportunities for sales.

Ziga: The first step was taken here with some Slovenian companies. Here is one example: We enabled consumers to see where milk comes from for more than 40% of all cheese that is sold in stores, as well as for approximately 10% of yogurt. When we first went to China in the middle of last year, we immediately got partners for the execution of the pilot project in Shanghai. It was noticed by the world’s largest retailer.

Host: Walmart?

Ziga: Walmart Food Safety Collaboration Center invited us to their innovation program. Within this program, we were chosen as the only non-Chinese company for our concept and application that addresses food safety in China.

Host: Here is a video of you accepting this award. Did this award open the door to world markets, including China, even though you had been present there before? 

Ziga: Actually, it’s just one part of our activities. We are also very active in the US - all co-founders and the whole team is very active. We have mathematicians, developers, economists - a very interdisciplinary team. Guys and gals are developing the application in Serbia and in Slovenia - one of the co-founders is from Serbia. The team is very connected and is doing superb work, which resulted in this award and the successful completion of the token sale.

Host: Can you explain to us how your application works?

Ziga: The customer takes the product and scans its barcode. They will receive basic information about the product. After they input the expiry date, they get the exact information on the farms that collected the milk for this exact batch of products. The data comes from the entire supply chain and, once it is recorded, blockchain technology ensures integrity. It is the technology we know already from bitcoin.It’s not just about crypto tokens, but also a technology that enables a huge advancement for the integrity of supply chains.

Host: What will blockchain technology change? Could we not, for example, falsify information about where the milk for this yogurt came from? Is that what you raised 18 million for?

Ziga: Blockchain is a technology that enables a new way of building trust where trust is non-existent or inadequate. There was a recent study in the UK where a third of companies could not guarantee the authenticity of the ingredients in their products. Technology like the blockchain is bringing a new principle of trust between individuals or between companies. But one problem is the cost and scalability of the blockchain, and also that companies are reluctant to share data amongst themselves - they are afraid they may lose something if they do. Our protocol that is now being developed with the collected funds is addressing these areas. We want to enable companies to implement a system that will be cost-effective and enable them to gain a competitive advantage due to transparency, not lose it.

Host: You said you also employ people in Slovenia as well as in Serbia. How many employees do you have at the moment?

Ziga: The company was founded in 2013 by three co-founders - me, Tomaz Levak, and Branimir Rakic who is from Serbia. He is also an MSc in IT &amp; Engineering. That’s why we decided to grow part of the team in Serbia. Despite two locations, we are a very homogeneous team. Most of the developers and engineers are based in Serbia.

Host: You said that you are very active. For the end, how much time do you actually spend in Slovenia?

Ziga: Very little. Not just me - with my colleague, we traveled a lot in the past months, we visited a lot of countries, spoke to lots of people, each of us traveled more than 100,000 kilometers. 

Host: If I were to sum up this conversation: To achieve success, you need a lot of travel, a lot of work, and a good idea.

Ziga: Exactly.

Host: Thank you for being our guest and I wish you plenty of success in the future.","","82ol78",NA,0,NA,"false",1522268712,"false","self","t5_3nyqu","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/OriginTrail/comments/82ol78/24hours_evening_news_a_slovenian_idea_conquered/","","",NA,"","",0,1

Q: What are the computing requirements to run a high quality node? Also, for a non tech savvy investor like me, what do I need to learn about running these nodes?

A: The technical requirements for running a high-quality node will be to provide server with an appropriate amount of hard drive space to facilitate the supply chain data at a significant uptime. Because there is no mining involved, a large amount computing power is not as needed as in Proof-of-Work based blockchain networks, but the system will still require the nodes to perform zero-knowledge proof computations and to serve the content. Hard drive space is needed to store the supply chain data, so the more agreements a node is involved in, the more HDD and CPU power it will need.

Q: Can I still get a node? How many TRAC do I need to get a node? Are there guides to set them up?

A: Anyone can set up a node, and the amount of TRAC needed is not fixed. As TRAC staking is needed per agreement, generally the more tokens one can stake should mean more potential agreements. The guide to set up the alpha node is available on our GitHub.

Q: Is it possible to lose the TRAC you're staking, and if so how does that work? Can someone running a node lose their TRAC simply because their internet crashed?

A: The stake [for the specific active contract] can be lost for not providing the service according to the agreement, for which one of the reasons can be the loss of internet connection. The DC node checks the DH nodes from time to time and can trigger the process of litigation for the agreement it sees not being fulfilled. [additional clarification: It does not mean that 100% uptime is required, the conditions for uptime will be part of the agreement. We will elaborate on the bidding mechanism in the next releases.]

Q: The Data Viewer will also have an opportunity to initiate the litigation procedure in case that received data is not valid. If that happens, and it is proved that Data Viewer received the false data, the stake of the corresponding DH node is lost. I mean if the hashes don't line up, then why/how did it even make it to the DV in the first place? Is there a reward for being a litigator in this case? because if its litigating by a member of the TRAC team is it then centralised? why not just apply the more stringent litigation tests at point of storage?

A: In case a malicious or malfunctioning DH node delivers information that is not the same as received from the DC node, the DC node can be triggered to perform the litigation process (i.e. by the DV) to check the DH node and confirm via the smart contract if the DH can provide the Merkle proof for the data it is providing. The OT team has no involvement in the litigation process, it is done automatically and is based on trusted execution of the smart contract.

Q: I have a question regarding reputation and the rewards for the reputation. I will give an example. Example: Person A and Person B have 100K TRAC each. They want to participate in the DH or DC node. Both are new node holders with no prior reputation with OT. Person A decides to stake all of the 100K TRAC for 1 year and signs a one year agreement. Person B stakes 100K TRAC for 3 months, then again signs agreement for another 3 months after the initial 3 months period, then again and then again...So, he signed the agreement for one year, but as 4 agreements of 3 months each with same 100K TRACs. Neither Person A or Person B removed any agreed upon TRAC from the agreement. The two questions i have are (Q1) Are the rewards going to be the same for Person A and Person B. Or will person B as he is building reputation by not taking any taking TRAC out every 3 months, will be rewarded more in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th three months agreement he signs. (Q2) Person A signed 100K for one year agreement. Will he/she be rewarded more in the second 6 months of the agreement compared to the first 6 months of the agreement as he is building reputation.

A: The reputation will be a function of time, amount of agreed upon tokens for the service and quality of service. The stake provides an additional mechanism for motivation to perform well for the agreement. Simplifying a bit, the reputation will be lowered if agreements get canceled and are based on the sizing of the part of time the agreement was not delivered. In that way the reputation measures in relative terms how much of a node’s agreement commitments haven't been performed, so it is not a direct function of the amount of cumulative stake (the 100k mentioned) a node puts up for the operation of agreements. We will release a more detailed documentation on reputation in the coming month.

Q: A data provider can choose to require a certain high level of reputation and stake. That is based on a set of parameters, I assume? It is not the case that a data provider can manually select exactly a dataholder, I assume? I expect that it is an automatic process that a data holder is chosen that meets the required specifications, such as reputation, sufficient staked tokens, enough storage capacity, cpu, bandwith, etc. 
What I mean is that it is prevented that a data provider itself sets up an x number of nodes. And will run entirely on its own nodes. That would bypass the decentralized principle. How do you ensure a fair distribution within the network? For example. Node A and B have the same specifications. Is the work evenly distributed over Nodes A and B?

A: The data provider chooses (via a DC node) what type of requirements for the agreements they need forming a range in which the candidate DH nodes can apply. In order not to let the DC be able to choose their own DH nodes (bypassing decentralization), the choice of the nodes is left to the smart contract which picks from the group of nodes who have applied as candidates for the agreement. Details on the first version of this bidding mechanism will be released with the Kosmos release later in April.

Q: What happens when a node is in maintenance? Will there be a maximum allowed downtime or something similar? I can imagine that if a node is unavailable too long, a replica will be made to another data holder. Is the maximum allowed downtime part of the agreement?

A: The DH node which is down has a period of time to respond to a litigation test from the DC node and this time is agreed upon in the agreement. If the data is unavailable for too long a new DH replica is established via a similar process of service initiation.

Q: Can anyone tell me what kind of hardware are we looking at for running a node. A basic computer or vps would ok? Do we need a dedicated IP address? Thanks

A: The technical requirements for running a high-quality node will be to provide the server with an appropriate amount of hard drive space to facilitate the supply chain data at a significant uptime. Because there is no mining involved, a large amount computing power is not as needed as in Proof-of-Work based blockchain networks, but the system will still require the nodes to perform zero-knowledge proof computations and to serve the content. Hard drive space is needed to store the supply chain data, so the more agreements a node is involved in, the more HDD and CPU power it will need.

Q: So if the Contract requires 20nodes of 10k each.. With the timeline of 1 year.. 
And if I have 200k can I bid for the contract.
Also it's just staking for nodes and making sure your net is up or you have to be active.

A: The agreement compensation is not part of the stake, so if the agreement compensation requires 200k an additional amount of tokens will be required to be put up for staking.

Essentially you want as many as you can afford because the node incentives scale with the amount staked (amongst other variables). Your tokens are the “glue” of the OT protocol, businesses can’t run on the protocol without your nodes.

The token demand model is still being optimised and all ROIs etc are yet to be confirmed. Additionally the token demand model will be independently audited to ensure it has longevity and ensures safety of the network and its participants


flipdrago:
The minimum to stake is 1 TRAC. OT doesnt have a masternode system, rather an incentive one based on reputation - the more coins you stake, the better and faster reputation you can get and if your uptime/agreement is good, you can bid for the projects that pay premium for higher uptime/space etc.

it is like building reputation on ebay, and then everybody buys your items first because everybody is happy with you
and are happy to pay more than the average

the more companies are onboarded, the more demand for nodes there will be and the higher amount the providers would be willing to invest to get better rep nodes

and once OT penetrates the larger markets, and manage to connect the other supply chain projects, (because OT is a protocol which is interoperable) and can connect the other blockchains together so they can read from each other, those with the best reputation will be very happy

*“Barry the Bear was back in ���� at the @EU\_Commission to discuss how @EVRYTHNG and @origin\_trail made him a smarter bear, certifying some of his #provenance and #authenticity data using the #blockchain #IoT #smartTags”*

Things got more interesting when the official OriginTrail Twitter account sent out this Tweet: [https://twitter.com/origin\_trail/status/989874780756238336](https://twitter.com/origin_trail/status/989874780756238336)

*“1/6 Meet Barry the Bear! This traceable teddy bear has set on a journey with #OriginTrail. Stay tuned for more updates! #TraceBarry”*

Once this Tweet came out, Maja confirmed on Telegram that there will be 6 parts to Barry’s story. The community started wondering what type of story the rest of the Tweets would tell. Fortunately, @jayjay from Telegram showed off his detective skills and shared some findings he had. He noticed that there were additional logos on Barry’s tag \(pictured in the Tweet\). The logos belong to Avery Dennison \([https://www.averydennison.com/en/home.html](https://www.averydennison.com/en/home.html)\) and to EVRYTHNG \([https://evrythng.com/](https://evrythng.com/)\).

He also found this webpage that shows Barry: [https://evrythng.com/verifying\-supply\-chain\-transactions\-with\-the\-blockchain\-and\-evrythng/](https://evrythng.com/verifying-supply-chain-transactions-with-the-blockchain-and-evrythng/).

*“The system is being piloted by a number of EVRYTHNG’s customers. It will also be used to power the provenance data of Barry the Bear, a demo we presented at the GS1 Global Forum to showcase our new product support for the web\-enablement of GS1 identifiers. Barry the Bear is a teddy bear with an EVRYTHNG Active Digital Identity \(ADI\), offering a lot of powerful features.”*

If that wasn’t interesting enough, he also found evidence of Barry being at the GS1 Global Forum in Brussels: [https://www.gs1.org/sites/default/files/market\_place\_summary\_2018\_v3.pdf](https://www.gs1.org/sites/default/files/market_place_summary_2018_v3.pdf).

The link in the Tweet leads to the following:

**More organisations sign agreement to help fight counterfeiting Published on: 16/04/2018**

\*Today, 3 more businesses and 1 association signed up to a memorandum of understanding \(MoU\) on the sale of counterfeit goods via the internet. This initiative, facilitated by the European Commission brings together right owners of products for which counterfeit versions are often sold online, with internet platforms and associations.

The new signatories to the MoU are the Motion Picture Association, Philip Morris International, Philipp Plein and Zanellato. They join the 19 other stakeholders already working together under the agreement.

Counterfeit products damage businesses, have a negative impact on jobs and tax revenues and often endanger the health of consumers.

The Commission encourages cooperation under the MoU, which remains open for other stakeholders to join.\*

Those are pretty big names. There's also a link to the [original MoU](https://ec.europa.eu/docsroom/documents/18023/attachments/1/translations/en/renditions/pdf) and the list that signed includes the following:

I was quickly drawn in after reading the whitepaper; the more I looked into the project, the more interested I became. I joined the community Telegram and started following their subreddit and Twitter, and it soon became evident how active and strong the community is. I also liked the fact that team members were active through the various social media channels. Basically, OT met all the requirements I had for a project I had hoped to find since I started researching blockchain technology.

During the next couple of months, I stayed active within the community and tried to help where I could. The team was hitting release deadlines, their social media followers grew, and with it the number of token holders grew too. Sure, there were bumps along the road – the market dipped, there was initial confusion about the staking model, and the market dipped again. However, it was evident from their roadmap that the team had a clear vision - there was no cause for concern.

Earlier this month, when I heard that the founders would be coming to San Francisco for a meet and greet, I decided that it would be the perfect opportunity to solidify my support for OT while also getting to know two out of the three founders. The day of the event came quickly and I left work early and boarded a plane to San Francisco. Due to a flight delay, I didn’t have much time to spare, but luckily I was able to take the train into the city without much difficulty. 

Upon arrival at the venue, I was warmly greeted by Tomaž and Žiga (T&amp;Z), and was happy to meet fellow Tracers (a total of seven Tracers attended the SF meetup). It was a very casual event and the founders were happy to answer questions while providing refreshments. I won’t go into too much detail on the topics that were discussed since it was a private meet and greet. However, what I will say is that we are in very good hands. Both T and Z were very approachable and seemed to have experience beyond their years. They were articulate and knowledgeable in their responses and their passion for OriginTrail was very evident. They are also heavily focused on adoption and partnerships, and are literally traversing the globe to make that happen. Suffice to say, I did not think I could be any more excited about this project. This experience has proven me wrong. 

I feel I could continue writing but I am conscious of everyone’s time. There are huge things on the horizon for OT: Kosmos release on Monday, Trace Alliance website next month, and my personal favorite – the Surveyor release (May 21st). 

Why is Surveyor my favorite? Well, it will include something that is truly unprecedented: a token demand model conducted by an independent third party. The team is willing to have a third party estimate the demand for the TRAC token based on the level of usability of the protocol. This just screams confidence for the project.

If you are still reading this and haven’t invested in TRAC, as always, I would advise that you Do Your Own Research. I just wanted to give some perspective on my experience and trace back my journey a little. I thought I was done accumulating TRAC, but after meeting the founders and fellow Tracers, my passion for this project has never burned brighter.

I hope you folks are well!  I have a question and was hoping I could source an answer from the community.  I have read the white paper and am having trouble wrapping my head around Data Creator and Data Holder nodes.  Specifically why we need both of them in the Network Layer.

From a distributed systems perspective, nodes in a peer to peer network can operate as both data publishers and storers depending on the request sent to them.  If you are publishing to a p2p network and you contact a node that does not host the information you are publishing, the node will basically forward the information to where it is supposed to go.  The same if you are retrieving information.  An information search and retrieval protocol is usually implemented so that you can contact any node and get the information stored in a different location.

All this to say, it seems like DC nodes and DH node could just be the same thing.  If you want to publish supply chain info, you send that to a node which checks the blockchain, finds where to publish the content, and publishes it.  This is currently done by two types of nodes, but it seems to me that it could be done by one type of node.

CEO of Origin Trail will be a panelist at the blockchain seminar at 2018 Home Delivery World which will be attended by many massive Fortune 500 retailers. The fact that blockchain is perhaps the hottest topic in supply chain tech and CEO of OT was chosen to be one of the few presenters speaks volumes. http://www.terrapinn.com/conference/home-delivery-world/Seminar-Blockchain.stm

The list of companies attending is insane. I'll list a few: Amazon, Walmart, Target, Publix, Samsung, Dick's Sporting Goods, Pepsico, Home Depot, Nordstrom, Uber Freight, Lowe's, Harris Teeter, General Motors... Representatives of these companies will hear directly from the head of OriginTrail about what they're working on. Obviously this doesn't guarantee anything but this is by far the largest and most important event OT has attended thus far. All of these companies are going to be interested in how they can save money, improve efficiency, increase product traceability, etc. and while they may be slow to adopt this is a huge opportunity for OriginTrail to showcase its work so far and its vision. I imagine they were invited in large part because of the Walmart award and this invitation only further adds credibility to the team.

I think it would be great if Vechain for example could use support by TRAC. Vechain is focusing more on mostly non-food products but if they could use TRAC protocol it could be much much bigger. It's a win-win for both parties.

Their mission is nearly identical to OT's: to increase transparency in food supply chain. They have a very impressive team as well that is larger and a bit more experienced. They seem to have some backing with Swiss government and like OT have had discussions with members of European Parliament. Is anyone invested in both projects? Is the team aware of Ambrosus? How do they compare? Are they competitors? I've been holding TRAC for months, but I must say from my research the past couple hours I'm starting to wonder if AMB is actually the more likely to succeed.

https://i.redd.it/n7m8j3pei7s01.png

""Records and registries like titling systems and supply chains are also feasible via a distributed ledger system though their level of interaction with an economic incentive layer is fairly limited if reliant on a closed proprietary system, and a proliferation of those assets into a digital ecosystem or marketplace would be severely stunted if based on closed rails. A free market system that fully utilizes the various facets that the open market is able to provide is necessary to facilitate true digital goods in a constantly developing digital ecosystem.""

Great article by Brent Xu from [ConsenSys](https://www.facebook.com/consensussystems/?fref=mentions). This is exactly the approach we are taking at [OriginTrail](https://www.facebook.com/origintrail/?fref=mentions) by implementing an open source, public blockchain based solution to unlock the right incentives which will bring transparency to supply chains globally.

Happy Sunday! This week has been packed with interesting updates, the next week is no less exciting. 

��️ What we are looking forward to the most: 

* Token Demand Model is expected on the 31st of May. It is a third\-party reviewed prediction model to estimate the demand for TRAC token based on the level of usability of the protocol [https://origintrail.io/roadmap](https://origintrail.io/roadmap). We are very excited to launch it. 
* Our advisor and chairman of Trace alliance[ John G. Keogh](https://twitter.com/JGKeogh) will have a Lightning talk next week at [Belfast Summit on Global Food Integrity 2018 \(ASSET 2018\)](http://www.asset2018.eu/)  The event is organized by Queen's University Belfast, one of leading research institutions in food safety on a global scale. The chairperson of the event is [Prof. Chris Elliott OBE](https://twitter.com/QUBFoodProf), one of the most reputable food safety experts. John will discuss how trust is built in food supply chains. He will also present OriginTrail use cases. 
* [Tomaž Levak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomazlevak/), CEO, and co\-founder and [Žiga Drev](https://twitter.com/DrevZiga), COO and co\-founder are in Hong Kong next week. They will be working from our Hong Kong office with our Partnership facilitator for Asian markets, Mr. [David McCann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidjmccann/) and his team. [Here is an official source](https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-community-monthly-report-2-february-2018-6236aa767666). We will also organize a meet and greet in Hong Kong. More information coming soon. 
* We expect CryptoLove's interview with John G. Keogh to be published next week, here is a [sneak peek](https://twitter.com/majavoje/status/999533612025503745) \(and there will be a giveaway\). 

��Here are some hidden gems in case you missed them: 

* OriginTrail co\-founders and biz dev team visited Slovenian [GS1](https://www.gs1.org/) on Friday.[ Here is a LinkedIn post by GS1 Slovenia's senior consultant ](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6405745912768983040/?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A(activity%3A6405745912768983040%2C6405751097536937984))Mr Matjaž Martini referring to our visit. As you well know, [OriginTrail is a member os GS1](https://medium.com/origintrail/gs1-membership-means-the-origintrail-protocol-will-speak-the-global-language-of-business-22226e91f176) Slovenia and [our protocol is fully compatible with GS1 standards](https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-development-update-v0-6a-kosmos-released-on-april-23rd-d04ff2f90001) since April and the team as well as the chairman of Trace Alliance, Mr. John G. Keogh believe that GS1 standards are absolutely crucial for blockchain technology adoption to supply chains. [Here is his statement \(video\).](https://twitter.com/majavoje/status/999533612025503745)
* Blockchain YouTuber CryptoCandor announced that she will feature OriginTrail in part 2 of [her video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkhLArO9IhA). We are very impressed with her knowledge and are very much looking forward to her review. 
* [BitsxBites shared more CTO's pics](https://twitter.com/bitsxbites/status/999436638060101632). Branimir Rakić, CTO and co\-founder is returning home from a successful visit to our Shanghai project office \([here is a list of our offices](https://origintrail.io/contact-us), next office: [USA in  Q3](https://origintrail.io/roadmap)\) 

You must be wondering \- is that all?

Of course not, we always have our ways to surprise you and deliver more, in this post I was only referring to events and updates that are already public. You know us by now. 

Have a great week &amp; Trace On!

Here is another spotlight post on OriginTrail’s advisors:

**Anthony Lai** is a Singapore\-based advisor to OriginTrail in the field of fintech. He is a senior director of an Asian commercial bank and shareholder &amp; co\-founder of Inspirar group/Petra. Prior to that, he worked for Barclays Investment Bank, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Deutsche Bank. He attended executive education programs at ​Cornell University, the ​Massachusetts Institute of Technology \(MIT\) and the ​University of Warwick.

“*Nevertheless, I believe banks are also conducting their testing on their own private blockchains. But these efforts are fragmented at best, and we need a neutral party such as* ***OriginTrail*** *to come in to provide standardized protocols and make it easier for participants to adapt and work together.”*

It is very encouraging that OriginTrail has a very experienced advisor who adds valuable banking industry experience to the team.

Hope you are having a nice weekend.

Let's briefly recap what has happened since my last update:

* As mentors and judges in ConsenSys's Blockchain for Social Impart Decentralized Impact Incubator, we held a presentation of Impact incubator in Ljubljana, Slovenia [https://twitter.com/origin\_trail/status/995271935151038464](https://twitter.com/origin_trail/status/995271935151038464). It was delightful to meet local teams and individuals interested in joining the next round of the incubator, especially so because [some of them are Tracers ](https://twitter.com/TheGhosTMost/status/994993702782357504)
* There was a new #TraceBarry update, this time a video. [Watch it here](https://twitter.com/origin_trail/status/995010274473193475).
* Tomaž Levak's \(Co\-Founder and CEO\) speech at Seeds&amp;Chips is [available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjMxMCIZz4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=5h1m05s).
* Žiga Drev \(Co\-Founder and COO\) gave [a great presentation ](https://twitter.com/EUOpenInn/status/994224048426176512)at the South of Italy, in Puglia

# Community Developments

* **Official:** Our community is growing nicely \(and organically\). We are planning to welcome a full\-time community manager to our team. Interested Tracers are welcome to [apply here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mzmW2iwaMOSMAhSvIe-62qr-hN3EF9HN7Y2kMmWpN2w/edit?usp=sharing).
* **Non\-official:** Next week we will publish our final #TraceBarry update. There are [some interesting guesses](https://www.reddit.com/r/OriginTrail/comments/8iqk4r/what_do_you_all_think_the_conclusion_of/) what it might be on Reddit

The team is working tirelessly to deliver not only the next technology release and token demand model as stated on the roadmap \([https://origintrail.io/roadmap](https://origintrail.io/roadmap)\) but also finish other deliverables.

More updates soon.

They’re unprofessional and they make it difficult for people to safely judge whether or not a project is legitimate. 

I don’t know if the rules of Reddit dictate whether or not mods can delete any post (freedom of speech and all) but I figured I’d request that any pointless post claiming that TRAC is going to increase 1000x or really any self-promoted “crypto-genius” saying that this project is going to moon be deleted. 

I obviously want the price of my holdings to increase, but I would like for that increase to be organic and as non-volatile as possible. This is a great project with amazing potential and I’m more concerned with its success than a quick buck.

   * **Why you should care**: I have not seen a project do this before. This is truly unprecedented. If having a third\-party estimate the DEMAND for the token doesn't scream confidence, I don't know what else to tell you.
* **Trace Alliance Website Launch**: Over 120 companies from 30 countries have expressed interest in implementing the TRAC protocol. Which ones will be on the website for launch?
   * **Why you should care**: There are already enough people currently noticing OriginTrail. The consensus is that partnerships and exchange listings are what people are anticipating. This would definitely contribute to the partnerships front.
* **Surveyor Release**
   * Initial version of consensus check with privacy layer \(zk\)
   * V2 of bidding mechanism
   * **Surveyor** will be the first release to utilize the consensus check \(the validation mechanism for interactions between supply chain parties used in OriginTrail protocol\) based on the privacy sublayer of OT protocol. It will also introduce improvements to the bidding mechanism and token utilization.
      * **Why you should care**: TRAC is the first supply chain project to include a Zero Knowledge Privacy Layer. Further details regarding the layer is crucial to this project. Furthermore, improvements to the bidding mechanism and token utilization should shed some more light on how TRAC nodes will be incentivized.
* **Conclusion of Barry Tweets**: [What we know so far](https://www.reddit.com/r/OriginTrail/comments/8g13xr/barry_the_gs1_bear_what_we_know_so_far/)
   * There are only 2 Tweets left to Barry's story. How will it end?
      * **Why you should care**: All signs are pointing to a major announcement at the conclusion of his story. Enough said.

Once we find ourselves at the end of the month, we will know much more about how nodes will be incentivized and the potential demand the Trace token will command.  We will also know the identities of the first group of companies to join the Trace Alliance. Finally, we will also have found out the end of Barry's story. Pretty exciting stuff, isn't it?

The news of a day, of course, is that we announced a partnership with EVRYTHNG, a IoT Smart Products Platform that will utilize the OriginTrail protocol for verifying data integrity with the blockchain. 

[https://twitter.com/origin\_trail/status/997522696874414080](https://twitter.com/origin_trail/status/997522696874414080)

A pilot program is up and running. OriginTrail founders presented the OriginTrail/EVRYTHNG solution in April when they were invited by the European Commission to present solutions that can help fight counterfeit\-related crime in the digital age. We are excited to proceed with bringing blockchain to more smart, tracable projects utilizing the EVRYTHNG platform and OriginTrail protocol.

We also sent out our  newsletter, enjoy it here [http://preview.mailerlite.com/v2h3z8](http://preview.mailerlite.com/v2h3z8) and sign up for it on our website. We send the newsletter every two weeks as a wrap\-up of key announcements, so you can get all the major updates without worrying about overloading your inboxes.

As for other updates, let me highlight two things from yesterday: 

* OriginTrail in Logistics\- \-we are partners of BTC logistics.  [http://www.btc.si/en/press\-releases/2018/03/btc\-company\-moves\-closer\-toward\-implementation\-blockchain\-technology](http://www.btc.si/en/press-releases/2018/03/btc-company-moves-closer-toward-implementation-blockchain-technology). Our CEO @tomazlevak presented #OriginTrail today at a BTC Logistics partners gathering. Jože Mermal, BTC Chairman, said blockchain technology is a vital driver of progress in the #logistics sector. More exciting things are in the pipeline. Including, but not limited to Digital Ship Maritime CIO Forum, London, UK, June 21, Presenter: Tomaž Levak, Co\-Founder &amp; CEO. Tomaž Levak will present OriginTrail at The iShipping Revolution, Blockchain: ""How distributed ledger technology will impact the supply chain world"" all in front of a panel at a specialized event for maritime professionals. Andrew Webster, OriginTrail’s Supply Chain Risk Management Advisor, will also join the panel. Companies and organizations such as JLT, BP, Digital Ship, Marlink, Thales, Telenor, Mespas, NSS Global, Marine traffic, Wista International, IPCSA\- International Port Community Systems Association, The Royal Institute of International Affairs, Chatham House, UK Major Ports Group, WISTA UK will investigate how they can measure the impact of digital business and harness the benefits of new technologies to improve performance — from ship, to store, to delivery,  and all related transportation and supply chain infrastructure. Andrew Webster &amp; Ken Lyon  are our advisors [https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewwebsterportsatjlt/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewwebsterportsatjlt/) [https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenlyon/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenlyon/) and  we are members of BiTA \(Blockchain in Transport Alliance\) [https://www.freightwaves.com/news/2018/3/7/origintrail\-announces\-bita\-membership#.WqAe2\_VFXfY.twitter](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/2018/3/7/origintrail-announces-bita-membership#.WqAe2_VFXfY.twitter).
* Our advisors are actively involved with the project, Tomaž Štolfa, entrepreneur in residence at Matrics Parners visited us at our office in Ljubljana yesterday and as you know next week John G. Keogh will be in Slovenia so get ready for more exciting updates.

But before, we will survive Monday :\) with our dev team who will launch 

Surveyor Release v0.8a \- May 21st [https://origintrail.io/roadmap](https://origintrail.io/roadmap)

* Initial version of consensus check with privacy layer \(zk\)
* V2 of bidding mechanism.

Surveyor will be the first release to utilize the consensus check \(the validation mechanism for interactions between supply chain parties used in OriginTrail protocol\) based on the privacy sublayer of OT protocol. It will also introduce improvements to the bidding mechanism and token utilization.

Have a good weekend, love having you onboard.

To see all these worthless shit coins with market caps in the billions of dollars is ridiculous &amp; inspiring all at the same time. I often ask myself that if vaporware like tron can go to 10 billion , what could a real company with a legit business use case do? The answer is, nobody knows, but the sentiment I see around TRAC gives me a tingling feeling, I knew this one was special and many others see the light as well.

Trac hasnt been around for a real bullrun, was released just at the start of the year and only had a small awareness amongst avid crpto traders. At its highest spike on the chart only reached 5x ICO price in USD on ether Delta. The whole market retraced and brought us down into a ""discovery"" period. BTC was manipulated up to $20k so it could be shorted by the pros on the CME all the way down to $5800. Something smells fishy! Accumulation perhaps. That's why I am accumulating OriginTrail , once accumulation is over , it's blastoff.

During this whole period OriginTrail was on a serious mission to get more work done and infrastructure built than I conceived humanly possible, they had an ambitious road map and hit every deadline to a T. Travelling to different countries, conferences, presenting to companies and governments all while their Dev  team quietly releases code to match their vision, also createing a brand new ""incentivised Node"" reward system like staking. I have been seriously dumbfunded how this coin hasn't reached at least 300 million Cap already. The answer is ,The market is not logical! Yet!  

Crypto still has alot of barriers to entry for normal people, they are too busy and uneducated to take the time to care enough, this will change, but it won't be mass adoption until it's spoon fed into their mouths, on the plus side businesses are eager to improve efficiency and profitability with blockchain. And they are looking for solutions, Enter OriginTrail !

OriginTrail is the definition of Undervalued!
This company has been working since 2012 for God's sake , what other crypto can claim that? 
Walmart awarded them for their protocol. Walmart is one of the biggest companies on planet Earth. Most recently Everthng partnered with OriginTrail and plans to run Nodes to support their system! That is ridiculously bullish ! 

As we move forward we must not be concerned with short term price fluctuations, if anything it's an opportunity to increase your position if you can. This could be a blue chip stock of the crypto world in 3-10 years. Just make sure to hold onto TRAC and run an incentivised node if you can. I know I will. With OriginTrail we must zoom out and and see the big picture! It's bright!

Peace Out

*Timestamps and key outtakes from each answer \(edited\):*

[**0:14**](https://youtu.be/1SbhfpLDYCw?t=0m14s) **For anybody who has not heard about OriginTrail yet, what are you doing?**

Ziga: OriginTrail is on a mission to increase transparency in supply chains. Our solution enables seamless exchange of data between businesses in a supply chain, in a secure way and with integrity as it is based on the blockchain.

[**0:55**](https://youtu.be/1SbhfpLDYCw?t=0m55s) **Why do we need blockchain, what is the problem you are trying to solve? What are the inefficiencies that currently exist that you are trying to take care of?**

Tomaz: Supply chains are increasingly complex \- they actually look more like networks than chains, and it creates a lot of opacity. To achieve more transparency and end\-to\-end visibility, we identified 3 subsets of problems:

* connecting the businesses together \(**data interoperability**\)
* how to create an environment where businesses feel at ease to share data \(incentivize and motivate them by removing the single central entity that would control the data; **scalable decentralization** brings neutrality\)
* how to enable the businesses to share the data that might be sensitive to the their competitive advantage: enabling consensus checks that provide integrity and objectivity of the data without revealing confidential information \(**managing privacy layers**\)

[**3:20**](https://youtu.be/1SbhfpLDYCw?t=3m20s) **What is going to be going on the blockchain and is going to be going off the blockchain? Where is what data going to go and why?**

Branimir: Supply chain events generate a lot of data. Blockchain is a trust machine, but it was not designed as a place where you could store a lot of data. OriginTrail is utilizing the blockchain for fingerprints of data that is stored off\-chain on the OriginTrail Decentralized Network. Smart contracts are validating the fingerprints with the original data, so one could always check if the data matches. Blockchain enables trust, but most of the functionalities are based on the OriginTrail network which is also decentralized and provides proper incentives needed for the system to function.

[**4:58**](https://youtu.be/1SbhfpLDYCw?t=4m58s) **What about consumer data protections? Say that I’m buying things and that data gets registered somewhere. Does it stay private? Do I own that data, does OriginTrail own that data and sell it to the third party?**

Ziga: Blockchain enables immutability of data. OriginTrail as a middleware between the blockchain and supply chain applications enables off\-chain immutability, but the data is not “eternalized”. Each actor in a supply chain \(including consumers\) can gain ownership over the data and can arbitrarily set the expiry date of the data they share. 

Tomaz: It is also how OriginTrail solves scalability. You don’t need to store most of the supply chain data forever. For a certain batch of products, it might be enough to enable immutable data for six months.

[**7:12**](https://youtu.be/1SbhfpLDYCw?t=7m12s) **You have been starting on Ethereum blockchain, but I heard you might me moving to other blockchains in the future, so you might be compatible with NEO, Stellar, or other blockchains?**

Branimir: Because only fingerprints of data are stored in the blockchain \(and smart contracts validate these data\), whatever blockchain offers these functionalities is suitable for OriginTrail. We don’t want to be tied to one certain system, the industry is still young and we might see other blockchains with good features emerge.

Tomaz: OriginTrail’s vision and aim is supply chain transparency. In technical terms, we try to be as agnostic as possible. We can work with whatever serves our vision and fits the value requirements we are trying to deliver. At the moment, Ethereum is by far the most compatible.

[**9:09**](https://youtu.be/1SbhfpLDYCw?t=9m09s) **Are you going to have masternodes?**

Branimir: We do have nodes, they are incentivized for providing the services on the network. They need to do what the systems needs them to perform: data imports, exchange of data, replication, fingerprinting, and computing the consensus check. We are not building the blockchain, so it does not require the consensus that is vital to delegated proof of stake \(which masternodes usually provide\). OriginTrail is solving a different set of problems, so the incentivization scheme is a bit different. Nodes negotiate with other nodes for services in the network, which requires a certain amount of stake per agreement. This amount is flexible which also makes for a more bullet\-proof and more decentralized system \(less risk of getting centralized\).

[**12:44**](https://youtu.be/1SbhfpLDYCw?t=12m44s) **What exactly is the function of the token in your ecosystem?**

Tomaz: Trace token is used as a glue within the ecosystem. For storing or writing the data, you need Trace tokens to compensate the nodes. For reading the data, you also compensate the nodes for the processing power used for performing consensus checks. Trace token manages relations between the users and the system’s nodes. There is no central authority that could impose the business model to the system. In that sense, the function of the Trace token is similar to gas on Ethereum, even though OriginTrail is not a blockchain.

[**14:39**](https://youtu.be/1SbhfpLDYCw?t=14m39s) **How do you compare to the competition? With so many projects operating in the similar space, how do you plan to stand out from the crowd?**

Ziga: OriginTrail is a middleware solution. It is not delivering an end\-to\-end solution but rather collaborating both with blockchain providers and with solution providers that already have their solution built for the supply chains. The market is still the blue ocean, the opportunities out there are plentiful. Solving a problem as complex as the opacity of supply chain requires a collaborative effort. If any “competitive solution” manages to be successful, that’s great for all of us.

[**16:42**](https://youtu.be/1SbhfpLDYCw?t=16m42s) **Is there any Walmart connection? Is there gonna be any Walmart connection? I saw you guys got that award, you could tell us a bit more about that.**

Ziga: We have been working in the Chinese market since March 2017. We have been involved in talks with several retailers there and the Chinese market is huge. We actually have a special guest visiting our offices today. Matilda Ho is the founder and CEO of Bits x Bites \(foodtech accelerator that has been supporting OriginTrail\) and Yimishiji \(online farmers’ marketplace from Shanghai\). With Yimishiji, OriginTrail has conducted a pilot project. They are to my knowledge the only online retailer, at least in China, that has implemented the decentralized solution to track goods. You can read more about it in [the Medium post](https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-alpha-network-deployed-and-tested-on-the-yimishiji-use-case-what-are-the-next-steps-c18068769ac2).

[**17:45**](https://youtu.be/1SbhfpLDYCw?t=17m45s) **Special guest Matilda Ho joins!**

Ziga: One of the great outcomes of the Yimishiji project was that OriginTrail was admitted into Walmart Food Safety Collaboration Center’s \(WFSCC\) Innovation Pipeline. More than 100 companies applied, and out of 12 selected participants, we were one of only two non\-Chinese teams admitted into the program.  We were also selected as one of the three winning solutions that are tackling food safety issues in China. The partnership and the pilot project we conducted in China is a joint effort with the Yimishiji team. It was a great opportunity to demonstrate what the capabilities of OriginTrail are, and that effort was noticed by the WFSCC. It is an inaugural program and we look forward to seeing what benefits we can reap out of it in the future. China is a big country with a rapidly growing market and there is a huge potential for us and Matilda’s team to bring a great future to its food supply chains.

[**20:52**](https://youtu.be/1SbhfpLDYCw?t=20m52s) **Matilda Ho speaks about her mission and cooperation with OriginTrail**

Matilda: Yimishiji is an online farmers’ market that brings organic, locally grown produce directly from farmers to the Chinese customers. We are promoting transparency and authenticity. Working with OriginTrail is enabling the consumers to be able to see where exactly the food comes from and how authentic the data could be; it enables us to tell a safe and clean food story to Chinese consumers. We are hoping to build more use cases, to be able to let people understand and give consumers tangible benefits from the food choices they are making. Bits x Bits is a food accelerator and an open innovation platform, so we are really happy that OriginTrail joined us last year.

[**23:07**](https://youtu.be/1SbhfpLDYCw?t=23m07s) **You were recently at the EU Commission, what were you doing there?**

Another guest was introduced! A more fluffy one :\)

Tomaz introduced Barry the Bear that comes with useful tags that can be used for smart tagging and authenticity. When connected to the OriginTrail’s integrity layer, more potential value gets unlocked. We will reveal more in the next couple of days, but for now you can find some clues on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/origin_trail).

[**24:37**](https://youtu.be/1SbhfpLDYCw?t=24m37s) **You are also working with the Trace Alliance which you have set up. Can you tell us more about that?**

Tomaz: Giving the potential to create something more scalable using decentralized technologies appeals to a lot of different companies. In our [Q1 report](https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-contributor-report-q1-2018-c224fd46ee17), we reveal what kind of companies are interested in utilizing the protocol. It’s a wide variety, including IT providers and software builders. Because it is a heterogeneous group, we are trying to facilitate a hub that will bring these organizations together. The companies share their existing challenges and we review them and make sure that decentralization makes sense in the use cases they propose. Once we see there is actually a use case for that challenge \(because we want tangible value\), we are able to look within the Trace Alliance members and interested organizations and create a group that can work on that challenge. The Trace Alliance is a collaborative knowledge hub where all interested parties come together \- from service providers, brands, corporations, even individuals and developers that can collaborate and work together to deliver new value for the protocol. It’s a community of ambassadors for adoption of the OriginTrail protocol.

[**28:02**](https://youtu.be/1SbhfpLDYCw?t=28m02s) **Where is OriginTrail going? What is the roadmap for this year? Where are we going to see it in 2\-4 years?**

Branimir: Two major technical milestones are launching testnet \(in June; with all functionalities built out\) and mainnet \(in Q3\) which will actually utilize the token for the protocol. In terms of further development, we will build further use cases on top of the protocol while monitoring both how the protocol and the network are performing. We will also determine what features are needed to support the use cases coming from the Trace Alliance and from partners utilizing the protocol.

Tomaz: OriginTrail has to become a global way of exchanging data with integrity. We have a great community of ambassadors, we are building towards a global adoption. We are creating a quality network of different companies that can act as integrators. It is not us working on all the implementations, but rather involving these companies that understand how the protocol works and be the layer that helps foster the ecosystem’s growth. Within the 5 year timespan, our vision is to be the key player for brokering trust between businesses.","false","8hkdbo",NA,0,NA,"false",1529688850,"false","self","t5_3nyqu","false","",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/OriginTrail/comments/8hkdbo/origintrails_interview_with_the_crypto_lark/","t3_8hkdbo",NA,NA,"","",0,0

This week our advisor John G. Keogh is in Slovenia. He is a fountain of inspiration and knowledge for the team. It is our great pleasure to have him here. Today we hosted a private event with John, local businesses in Slovenia, and GS1 Slovenia representatives. We posted[ this tweet today](https://twitter.com/origin_trail/status/999627736091152384), the event report is going to be published tomorrow. Before you ask, yes, there is news related to Trace alliance that was announced at the event.

Not only John, but all our advisors are actively involved in our business developments. Today we were also delighted to publish an interview with Mr Antony Lai, our fintech advisor based in Singapore. He is a senior director of an Asian commercial bank and shareholder &amp; co\-founder of Inspirar group/Petra. Prior to that, he worked for Barclays Investment Bank, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Deutsche Bank. He attended executive education programs at ​Cornell University, the ​Massachusetts Institute of Technology \(MIT\) and the ​University of Warwick. [Read an interview here](https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-fintech-advisor-anthony-lai-talks-the-future-of-supply-chain-and-trade-finance-a7791c91b3a9). My favorite quate is:

""I believe banks are also conducting their testing on their own private blockchains. But these efforts are fragmented at best, and we need a neutral party such as OriginTrail to come in to provide standardized protocols and make it easier for participants to adapt and work together.""

After getting rid of some more bugs and implementing more usability improvements, we were ready to [launch our new website ](https://twitter.com/origin_trail/status/999583941286879232) \(MON was a soft launch, now we are ready to proudly tell the world that it is out there\). Please note that OriginTrail does website development and designed in\-house, so if you have any further feedback, our team is very happy to consider it. We also sent out an email about privacy policy change, to comply with GDPR. In short, we use 2 tracers, Hotjar for UX improvements and Google analytics for website optimization. We only get your email if you sign up for the newsletter and we do not do remarketing \(no Google Adwords and Facebook Pixel on our site, you are welcome to see that for yourself using for example [https://www.ghostery.com/](https://www.ghostery.com/).

Last but not least, next week Crypto Love YouTuber \(86K subscribers\) will publish an interview with John. [Here is a sneak peek.](https://twitter.com/majavoje/status/999533612025503745?s=21)

Tomorrow you will learn more about today's events. What else are we looking forward to? Token demand model to be verified by a third party will be published in May.[ See the roadmap](https://origintrail.io/roadmap).

Ethershift.co","A Brand New User Friendly Erc20 Token Exchange Just Launched! 100% Anonymous! No Accounts! Ethershift.co

Ethershift.co is a brand new Erc20 token exchange that provides a very easy way to get the Erc20 tokens that aren’t listed on big traditional exchanges such as Binance and Bittrex. 

After a tokens ICO is finished, the tokens are typically sent to the investors immediately. Listings on major exchanges take a lot of time and money and are usually not a speedy process if they ever happen at all. A handful of Erc20 decentralized exchanges have popped up that allow for first access to these tokens. Erc20 decentralized exchanges however are difficult to use for the average person. You must use meta mask, constantly have ether in gas for any transactions, and sometimes the network is really slow and expensive to use. Since the processes to acquire these tokens is not easy, a lot of average crypto investors simply won’t buy them until they’re on a bigger exchange, and by then they have already missed out on big gains. 

Ethershift wants to make the process of acquiring the newest Erc20 tokens as simple as possible for everyone. 

1. Select the token you’d like to receive. 
2. Send your Ether to the address provided
3. That’s it! Within minutes the tokens you ordered will be sent to your address. 

Ethershift.co launched with 10 coins initially and will add 20 more before the end of May! 

Coins currently available on Ethershift are Origin trail (TRAC), Bee (BEE), Bounty 0x (BNTY), Payfair (PFR), Devery (EVE), Bitclave (CAT), Flixxo (FLIXX), Auctus (AUC), Tomochain (TOMO), Fusion (FSN)!

It has been enlightening to learn about John’s background and experience and having him as an advisor to the board is a huge asset for OriginTrail. His experience with supply chain management, GS1 standards, and RFID solutions will certainly play an integral part in OT’s future.

In case you haven't noticed, yesterday our website got a little facelift [https://origintrail.io/](https://origintrail.io/).

Congrats to our web and design team for launching such a creative platform with great usability. Please share any feedback or criticism you may have, I am happy to hear them! Simply comment on this post below. Thanks a million!

What else has been going on today?

* Branimir Rakić, our co\-founder, and a CTO is in Shanghai, China. He presented OriginTrail at the[ AmCham Food Conference](https://twitter.com/origin_trail/status/999228971404480512), where they discussed the possibilities of blockchain with Chinese business leaders. There was also a bilingual dev meetup with Yimishiji CTO and Branimir.
* What was the surprise I promised this weekend? Well, apart from the website relaunch, we also recorded an AMA with John G. Keogh and [YouTuber Crypto Love](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu7Sre5A1NMV8J3s2FhluCw) today.  It was a wonderful interview, I am delighted to share it with you next week.

While our team is very busy with putting the last GDPR related changes in place, we are very excited to host a meeting with John G. Keogh, local GS1 representatives and businesses tomorrow. Will definitely send post some pics and publish an event report.

Many thanks for supporting OriginTrail

""Good morning Tracers, I will just briefly update you ...
Hope you enjoyed https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-community-monthly-report-4-april-2018-a9046c01eb41 yesterday.
Today Matilda Ho is visiting us, we will organise some business meetings and a presentation in Ljubljana. Will send pics.

If you do not know who Matilda Ho is, please read this https://www.ted.com/speakers/matilda_ho.

There is a new release planned on Monday.
Zond Release v0.7a - May 7th
- Initial version of zero knowledge privacy layer
- Neo4j Compatibility
- Standardized and documented graph logic
With the insights from performance and usage of the protocol, Zond will introduce a fully standardized and documented OriginTrail graph structure as well as compatibility with Neo4j database to allow further flexibility in the data layer for implementation (ability to choose more than one database). This release also introduces the first version of the zero-knowledge privacy sublayer in the protocol. 
Source: https://origintrail.io/roadmap

OriginTrail enables seamless data sharing along any supply chain. Decentralized, blockchain-supported platform ensures trust, transparency, and securi...
what is super-important here is zero-knowledge proof . We aim to launch a video explainer either on Monday or later on.

the 4th part of #tracebarry will be published this weekend- getting more tangible ...

Where I live, it is impossible to grow certain types of food (Norway, cold climate). If you're eating these types of foods that have travelled across the planet (bananas, kiwis e.g), it will enhance the footprint you make on this globe.

What if OriginTrail made something like FairTrade (social movement which have the goal of helping producers in developing countriess). OriginTrail will have extreme amounts of information in hand in their databases. By utilizing this data, they could make something called (for example) ""LocalTrade"", which goal is to promote local eating. 

A rating system could be made, (range from 1-5, 1-10, whatever fits), where each produce is given a certain amount of points regarding the distance between where it is scanned (by the end user), and where it is produced. Your phone would be the localizer, measuring the distance.

The customer would then (hopefully) pick out products that are produced closer than others. 
This would make the OriginTrail-app a GO-TO when buying food, and also incentivize producers to be a part of the OT-network. 

There are SO many different things this system of information could be used for..

Today he was in Moscow presenting the OriginTrail Protocol at the World Bank event to representatives from the Russian government and  businesses. They were discussing the power of digital technology and opportunities for Russian agriculture. [See photos](https://twitter.com/origin_trail/status/996420905642446848).

Here are the highlights:

* World Bank Agtech Moscow. ""We will be able to monitor all farm land in Russia very soon as our digitization strategy rolls out"" Ministry of Agriculture. [https://twitter.com/JGKeogh/status/996358971295502336](https://twitter.com/JGKeogh/status/996358971295502336)
* ""With Dr. Sjaak Wolfert from Wageningen in Moscow. Dr Wolfert is the scientific lead for EU's internet of farming 2020. Provided great briefing. Will showcase @origin\_trail  case studies shortly."" [https://twitter.com/JGKeogh/status/996429783046213632](https://twitter.com/JGKeogh/status/996429783046213632)

**Other Updates:**

* the dev team is working hard to deliver the next technology release on Monday. It will be an important one! **Surveyor Release v0.8a \- May 21st**

\- Initial version of consensus check with privacy layer \(zk\)

\- V2 of bidding mechanism

Surveyor will be the first release to utilize the consensus check \(the validation mechanism for interactions between supply chain parties used in OriginTrail protocol\) based on the privacy sublayer of OT protocol. It will also introduce improvements to the bidding mechanism and token utilization.

* Don't forget that the Token Demand model will be audited by a third party within the next  two weeks. [https://origintrail.io/roadmap](https://origintrail.io/roadmap). May is very exciting here at OriginTrail.
* As for the comm team, [only Barry knows](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;q=%23tracebarry&amp;src=typd), what is up. ;\)

Stay tuned &amp; thanks for being a part of our amazing journey! It's great to have such amazing support from our community! #TraceOn

Much love,

* Supply chain is the most practical use\-case for blockchain. It is the use\-case that makes the most sense and is closest to implementation and adoption. OriginTrail isn’t just another player in the supply chain management space: the OriginTrail protocol functions as a middle\-layer and aims to foster data sharing in supply chains regardless of a company’s ERP platform, system infrastructure, or blockchain layer of choice.
* This interoperability is made possible by the integration of globally recognized GS1 standards for the data sets collected and shared between companies. In addition, OT's implementation of a zero\-knowledge privacy layer will encourage companies to participate and share data crucial to achieve supply chain transparency without compromising proprietary or sensitive data.

\(2\) **OriginTrail has a solid team that is laser focused and has constantly delivered**

* Whether it is traveling the globe to promote the protocol’s adoption, interacting with the community, or hitting release deadlines, the OriginTrail team has simply been stellar.
* The dev team has met the deadlines for all 6 of the scheduled releases to date. There are only 2 releases left on the calendar and will be followed by the testnet launch.
* The founders have been attending conferences, trade shows, community meet and greets, and even presented to the EU Commission.
* OriginTrail’s CMO, Maja Voje, has been relentless in her involvement with the OT community and keeps everyone interested and excited for what’s coming next. I cannot keep going down the list but every OT team member has played a major role in the project’s success so far.

\(3\) **OriginTrail has a working product, real world use cases, and confirmed partnerships**

* OT’s protocol is already at work tracing products such as poultry and dairy and integrating data from forensic laboratories. A pilot is also currently being developed in the logistics space \(BTC Logistics partnership\). Most recently, a partnership with EVRYTHNG was confirmed that adds trust to an ecosystem that uses GS1 identifiers to digitize products. \([https://medium.com/origintrail/connecting\-smart\-products\-with\-origintrail\-announcing\-partnership\-with\-evrythng\-52cb7345b8e8](https://medium.com/origintrail/connecting-smart-products-with-origintrail-announcing-partnership-with-evrythng-52cb7345b8e8)\)

\(4\) **OriginTrail is assembling the Trace Alliance**

* Spearheaded by OriginTrail’s Head of Business Development, Nino Pirtovšek, the Trace Alliance is a collaborative partnership hub aimed at connecting businesses with technology vendors to foster the protocol’s adoption. Over 120 interested companies have been sent on\-boarding kits. The Trace Alliance website is scheduled to launch by end of month.

\(5\) **OriginTrail is releasing a Token Demand Model conducted by an independent third\-party**

* I’ll be honest: I care about the numbers. I care about market cap, token price, and potential profits from running a node in addition to everything I have mentioned so far. I want to succeed **WITH** OriginTrail. The fact that they are allowing a third\-party to release a prediction model to estimate the demand of the Trace token based on the level of usability of the protocol is astounding. The team’s confidence in releasing this token demand model has enabled me to have the utmost confidence in them. The token demand model will be released by end of month.

      * Rocketchat members: 888
      * Facebook followers: 2,553
      * LinkedIn connections: 909
      * **Why you should care:** What a month for OriginTrail!  The team never ceases to deliver.  It is hard to believe that OriginTrail was present at 13 events in 7 countries while continuing to make progress in growing its team, hitting their biweekly technology release deadlines, updating their website, and adding JGK as the TA chairman!  They have completed their warmup for testnet and beyond. Well done!
* [**International IT company TMA Solutions Announces Partnership with OriginTrail**](https://medium.com/origintrail/international-it-company-tma-solutions-announces-partnership-with-origintrail-fe2a312a2f95)
   * Companies can now engage directly with TMA Solutions to develop applications based on the OriginTrail protocol
   * TMA Solutions was incorporated in 1997 by Bui Ngoc Anh, and now employs 2,200 engineers and has clients in 27 countries
   * Their clients and partners list includes internationally well-known companies such as Nokia, Toshiba, Alcatel Lucent, Sharp, Brightstar, Ribbon, Mitel, NEC, Hitachi, Avaya and others
   * **Why you should care:** TMA Solutions partnering with OT and joining the Trace Alliance will provide an opportunity for many companies without technological expertise to implement the OT protocol. Employing 2,200 engineers and already having customers in 27 countries, TMA Solutions has been revealed as the first global “integrator” for OT. This is a big step forward in establishing the collaboration within the TraceAlliance and will also serve to attract future members.
* [**1st proof of concept with TMA Solutions: tracing animal feed using the blockchain**](https://medium.com/origintrail/proof-of-concept-4-organizations-join-forces-to-bring-blockchain-traceability-to-the-animal-feed-fe8daf933f8f)
   * 4 Organizations Join Forces to Bring Blockchain Traceability to the Fish Feed Companies and Pet Foods Suppliers (Entobel, TMA Solutions, the Vietnam Food Integrity Center (FIC) and OriginTrail)
   * TMA Solutions and Entobel have agreed to engage in a proof of concept to develop a functional system for Entobel’s innovative business. The proof of concept is based on the OriginTrail’s protocol platform and seeks to integrate with an analytical laboratory to demonstrate how the scientific reports can add integrity to their business model
   * OriginTrail’s partnership with Entobel goes beyond the proof of concept and is an example of cooperation within the Trace Alliance that connects enterprises with the service providers and other entities, creating an ecosystem for powerful supply chain applications using blockchain technology
   * **Why you should care:** This is the first example of multiple organizations cooperating within the Trace Alliance to achieve a common goal. Once more members of the Trace Alliance are revealed and additional members join, the potential for more collaborations will only grow. It is very impressive and promising that this is occurring prior to testnet. This proof of concept can also serve as a framework for future collaborations – talk about trailblazing!
* [**OriginTrail Development Update: v1.0b-RC Lunar Orbiter Released on June 18th**](https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-development-update-v1-0b-rc-lunar-orbiter-released-on-june-18th-6edc630d148c)
   * The payment mechanism is now extended to support the ability to perform trustless, monetized data reading from the OriginTrail Decentralized Network (ODN). In this way, the data creator (DC) and data holder (DH) nodes will be able to charge a fee from data viewer (DV) nodes, which would read data from them in order to provide them with the requested data
   * When it comes to the zero-knowledge implementation in the ODN, the Lunar Orbiter now supports quantity validation across several events in the observed supply chain, with the ability to have them be reported in arbitrary stages of their execution, across multiple XML files
   * The team will be announcing a bounty program to involve the community in bulletproofing the code and helping with testing to reach a stable, production-ready version of the ODN mainnet in Q3
   * **Why you should care:** 8 releases down and 1 to go. The team has gone 8 for 8 so far in meeting their tech release deadlines. Further improvements to the payment mechanism and the zero-knowledge privacy layer have put this release candidate for testnet in a great position for release. I am also pleased that the team will be announcing a bounty program to encourage the community to participate and provide feedback during testnet. This will ultimately help improve the quality of the mainnet launch.

I am so glad to be back just in time for testnet.  This will be the first time I will be hosting a node and am excited to learn and provide feedback to the team.  If you are on the fence about participating in testnet, just remember that the more participants there are, the better mainnet launch will be!  Plus, since reputation will play a factor for your node, it will be very helpful to get some practice in during testnet!

I have just returned from Belgrade. It was amazing to spend two weeks with our product team working hard to build a great testnet user experience for companies joining the test network and node holders. 

I have just shared 12 pics on Twitter: 

* Meet the team [https://twitter.com/majavoje/status/1010935522410356736](https://twitter.com/majavoje/status/1010935522410356736)

CEO and co-founder Tomaž Levak is back in Slovenia after more than one month of roadshow. COO and co-founder Žiga Drev is still on the road. He [spoke at the TechSauce conference in Bangkok](https://twitter.com/origin_trail/status/1010059554342735873) on Friday and yesterday, and his next stop is Berlin, where he will be presenting at the [World Food Convention](https://www.worldfoodconvention.com/). 

Testnet will be live in 5 days. After analyzing survey results, our team made multiple efforts to prepare a non-dev-first node installation manual. We will test the instructions thoroughly before publishing them on Friday and we will open a new support channel for node holders with a devoted tech admin. We expect to have one more biz dev update before the testnet.

Next week is gonna be super exciting. Thank you for supporting OriginTrail and let’s rock testnet launch in 5 days! 

Trace on &amp; have a great week

It looks like John G. Keogh, Trace Alliance Chairman, shared the stage with Professor Chris Elliott OBE, Pro\-Vice Chancellor at Queen’s University, Belfast.

[Professor Elliott OBE](https://twitter.com/QUBFoodProf) has been awarded both the FRSB \(Fellowship of the Royal Society of Biology\) and OBE \(Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire\). Prof. Elliott OBE also conducted the UK Government’s inquiry into the horsemeat scandal of 2013.

A main heading on the [ASSET 2018 website](http://www.asset2018.eu/Home/) states “ENSURING THE INTEGRITY OF THE WORLD’S FOOD SUPPLY”. Maja also shared a [Tweet](https://twitter.com/notaspy/status/1001788762500845569) which included a picture of TA Chairman JGK and Prof. Elliott OBE on stage. What is the connection of this event to OriginTrail? The obvious one is JGK and Maja stated in her post that there will be more updates this coming week!

It is also interesting to note that Queen’s University Belfast is listed as a partner on Hoan Vu’s [website](http://hoanvulab.com/partners/#). In case you forgot, OT currently has a pilot program running with Hoan Vu which is focused on “**verifying the integrity of food supply chains by analyzing samples from batches of food using modern analytical and scientific technologies. OriginTrail’s blockchain\-based solution will act as the infrastructure for integrating and distributing data and reports to the laboratories’ clients, extending traceability and providing an additional layer of transparency and trust.”**

Wondering what we are doing 11 days prior to the testnet launch? 

Wonder no more. Here is what has recently happened: 

* News of the day, of course, is a[ technology release](https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-development-update-v1-0b-rc-lunar-orbiter-released-on-june-18th-6edc630d148c). 
* Branimir presented at [IoT forum in Bled](https://twitter.com/tvidonja/status/1008656426959597569), Slovenia
* Tomaž was a panelist at the [10th Global Cold Chain Summit](https://twitter.com/origin_trail/status/1008706994398736384) in Tianjin, China

We also published a cool countdown bar to testnet on our website - [check it out.](https://origintrail.io/)

Let’s discuss some future plans:

* There will be at least one biz dev update more before the testnet 
* [Spring roadshow](https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrails-spring-roadshow-meet-the-team-out-on-the-road-1f2568925baf) officially became a spring/summer tour, since new events are lined up for our co-founders. Tomaž will travel from China to London to speak at [Digital Ship Maritime CIO Forum](https://www.london.thedigitalship.com/) and he will also host a [Meet &amp; Greet with Tracers in London](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf-vDMdtQ9AQg4NtVNdEWwsln71u2odEijfvbOwmmemaWLPjA/viewform) on the 20th of June. You are welcome to join us. Žiga will speak at [Tech Sauce Global](https://summit.techsauce.co/) in Bangkok, Thailand on the 22nd-23rd of June and in Berlin, Germany at World Food Convention on the 26th of June. 
* Thank you so much for pitching in in the nodes survey. We are delighted with the response rate and we got great insights into what the community needs. We will align the onboarding materials to these findings. 

I will be back in a couple of days.

Meanwhile, enjoy the testnet countdown and our [daily updates on Twitter!](https://twitter.com/origin_trail)

I am delighted to let you know that we launched a pre\-tech release before the testnet launch on the 29th of June. It is called v0.9a Explorer, it introduces “Web Of Things” \(IoT\) standard to OriginTrail and multiple privacy layer and general code improvements. [Read more here](https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-development-update-v0-9a-explorer-released-on-june-4th-8be8c3946ffb).

Here is my favorite part of the blog post:

Some of our partners already utilize IoT and smart tags \(check out our blog posts about our co\-operation with [Evrythng](https://medium.com/origintrail/connecting-smart-products-with-origintrail-announcing-partnership-with-evrythng-52cb7345b8e8) and [TagItSmart](https://medium.com/origintrail/utilizing-smart-sensors-to-prevent-wine-fraud-origintrails-pilot-with-tagitsmart-1949dc62113f)\), which both support the Web of Things. [Estimates](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/telecom/internet/popular-internet-of-things-forecast-of-50-billion-devices-by-2020-is-outdated) predict that the global count of IoT devices will be around 30 billion strong by 2020 \(we saw annual growth of about 30&amp;#37; up until 2017\), many of which will be involved in much\-needed uses for supply chains like unique product identification, temperature monitoring, lightness during distribution, and precise geolocation.

�� [And there is a hidden gem in a blog post: ](https://twitter.com/majavoje/status/1003712422660788225)Houston— our UI application which now allows for the visualization of the graph data stored on your node. The UI has also received a small facelift and is slowly taking its final design form.

Trace Alliance chairman and OriginTrail advisor John G. Keogh is almost ready to share his big announcement from Belfast Summit on Global Food Integrity in Belfast last week with us. [He tweeted Foodnavigator Asia article](https://twitter.com/JGKeogh/status/1003508018493972480) today.

And stay tuned for more updates. We are working with him to deliver more information exclusively for our community.

Let me conclude by giving a big shout\-out to P2P legends in our community:

2. Ambitious roadmap with no missed deadlines

4. Growing list of partnerships and the upcoming launch of the Trace Alliance
5. Strong and helpful community

It is testnet launch day, so let’s keep this one short &amp; sweet. 

[All hands are on testnet](https://twitter.com/majavoje/status/1012668872451862529), launch button shall be pushed in evening hours in Europe. 

Here is a brief report from our CTO and co-founder Branimir Rakić: 

“We will be able to provide a solid documentation, instructions, and UI for everyone to be able to try it out. The feedback/support process is set up well and the website with install instructions is nearly done as well.

Today you can look forward to: 

* Landing page for node holders with instruction how to install a node 
* New support channels for beta network participants (node holders) and 
* Houston - the visual user interface which makes operating a node easy for everyone  
Yesterday we published a blog post

# [OriginTrail: A Look into Network Mechanisms, Incentives and Market Forces](https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-a-look-into-network-mechanisms-incentives-and-market-forces-e99938b8687c)

In it,[ there is a sneak peek how the Houston app will look like](https://twitter.com/majavoje/status/1012668636132233216). It will be available for Windows and macOS. 

Today is going to be an exciting day. Huge kudos to the entire team who works tirelessly to deliver testnet today and keeping our standard of never missing a deadline.

Still in Belgrade, still working hard with our product team to bring you a great testnet participating experience 

And here are the first fruits of our joint efforts: [Testnet Introduction blog post  ](https://medium.com/origintrail/countdown-to-the-origintrails-testnet-launch-begins-323a54005c26)

CTO and co\-founder, Branimir Rakić wrote a [blog post ](https://medium.com/origintrail/countdown-to-the-origintrails-testnet-launch-begins-323a54005c26)in which he presents the purpose, goals and community actions for our testnet prep. There are 16 days left before we launch the testnet. We will frequently update you in the meantime. But we need to hear from your first. We prepared a short survey.

What else is new since my [last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/OriginTrail/comments/8q908y/cmo_update_june_11th_2018/) on Monday? 

* Talking about the blockchain at AmCham Shanghai’s Nanjing Next Summit. OriginTrail Co\-Founder &amp; CEO Tomaž Levak joined the CTO of Microsoft China and the director of Deloitte China Blockchain Group at the panel. ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/origin_trail/status/1006140317538582528)) 
* AG/SUM is the leading Japanese AgTech summit, hosted by Nikkei. OriginTrail Co\-Founder &amp; COO Žiga Drev presented at the summit, talking about what the blockchain can do for data integrity in the industry. ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/origin_trail/status/1006824433284190210)) 
* Branimir Rakić [presented at an IoT &amp; Blockchain meetup](https://twitter.com/branarakic/status/1006915923461238786) in Belgrade organized by TagItWine, our IoT advisor Srđan Krčo was also there
* A community member /u/CryptoProtocol did a [timestamped transcript](https://www.reddit.com/r/OriginTrail/comments/8qm774/origintrails_ceo_tomaz_coo_ziga_drev_interview/) of the interview our co\-founders Žiga and Tomaž had with Cryptosomniac.

I could not be in touch with you as much as I usually like to be this week.I had a little health bug, but glad to let you know that I am back on TRAC\(k\) now.

Let’s briefly recap the week

* Token Demand Model was [published](https://origintrail.io/token-demand-model) and [explained](https://medium.com/origintrail/the-driving-forces-of-the-trace-ecosystem-e2cb4454c6e1). With this release, we fulfilled all deliverables for May. Proud to say that we did not miss any release deadlines so far.
* Our advisor and chairman of Trace alliance[ John G. Keogh](https://twitter.com/JGKeogh) was at [Belfast Summit on Global Food Integrity 2018 \(ASSET 2018\)](http://www.asset2018.eu/) The event was organized by Queen's University Belfast, one of leading research institutions in food safety on a global scale. The chairperson of the event was [Prof. Chris Elliott OBE](https://twitter.com/QUBFoodProf), one of the most reputable food safety experts. Here is a sneak peek [https://twitter.com/notaspy/status/1001788762500845569](https://twitter.com/notaspy/status/1001788762500845569), happy to share more updates next week.
* [Tomaž Levak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomazlevak/), CEO, and co\-founder and [Žiga Drev](https://twitter.com/DrevZiga), COO and co\-founder are in Hong Kong. They have been working from our Hong Kong office with our Partnership facilitator for Asian markets, Mr. [David McCann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidjmccann/), and his team. [Here is an official source](https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-community-monthly-report-2-february-2018-6236aa767666). We also organized a meet and greet in Hong Kong.
* A wonderful YouTuber CryptoCandor published a[ project review of OriginTrail today ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYNWCU7uU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=9m21s)

Crypto Love will publish an interview with John G. Keogh next week. In the following week, we expect to record one more interview with a respected YouTube content creator.

What will be going on next week:

* On Monday we have a tech release: Explorer Release v0.9a\- With Explorer we will introduce another standard \(apart from implemented GS1 EPCIS and initial standardization\), which will be determined in contact with the use cases and implementation feedback. Further improvements will be implemented to the privacy layer as well. There are only 2 more releases before the testnet. Very exciting!
* Chairman of Trace alliance John brought some exciting news from Belfast. He will share it with our community next week.
* Žiga and Tomaž will be in Singapore and Shanghai next week. I bet they will report some interesting updates and/or send us cool pictures to tweet!
* I will pack my bags \(yes, plural!\)  and move to Belgrade for 14 days to work with the product team \(dev and design\) to deliver fantastic updates in June.
* We will publish our monthly community report for May.

Great to be back with you in full swing.

Just a quick hi from Ljubljana office. Our team is working hard to deliver you testnet this Friday. Žiga presented OriginTrail at [World Food Convention](https://twitter.com/TspVerlag/status/1011623572903735296) in Berlin yesterday. He is returning to Ljubljana tomorrow. We are very excited to be all together in the office again after one month of [Spring/Summer roadshow](https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrails-spring-roadshow-meet-the-team-out-on-the-road-1f2568925baf) and my working trip to Belgrade. 

I am also very happy to tell that I managed to do my first ever node installation yesterday in less than 10 minutes. No coding, wonderful flow. 

Yesterday the internal testing with non-devs was successfully done, moving to external testing today (closed group). We are progressing nicely towards the testnet launch on Friday. 

We will be launching new assets and support channels later on this week and we will introduce technical admins (leaders of testnet beta program) to the community.

It differs from the more common model of staking in decentralized networks where a certain, usually relatively large amount of tokens, is set as collateral in order to qualify as a validator (i.e. Ethereum Casper) or to perform a different set of services (i.e. Dash Tier 2 Masternode) within a system.

- TRAC is staked whilst nodes fulfill agreements to store data, convert to graph &amp; hash form and replicate

- no minimum TRAC staking requirement

- no particular set reward for staking X amount of tokens, it is set for every agreement separately

- staked amount is used to ensure the agreement success, incentivizes non-malicious behaviour

- staking returns scale with amount staked (and reputation of node)

- token demand model https://medium.com/origintrail/the-driving-forces-of-the-trace-ecosystem-e2cb4454c6e1 was independently audited

Node UI is being developed by OT team, enabling simple deployment, tracking of agreements/stakes/rewards and maintenance of nodes.

In 2 weeks we are launching the testnet. Everyone is super-focused on launching the testnet, but we still manage to share biz dev updates. More are expected to come before the testnet launch on the 29th of June.

What happened in the last 2 days since [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/OriginTrail/comments/8qtvgj/cmo_update_june_13th_2018/)?

* We revealed a [new partnership](https://medium.com/origintrail/international-it-company-tma-solutions-announces-partnership-with-origintrail-fe2a312a2f95) and a [use case](https://medium.com/origintrail/proof-of-concept-4-organizations-join-forces-to-bring-blockchain-traceability-to-the-animal-feed-fe8daf933f8f) that we are preparing with this partner.
* Tomaž spoke at [Global Cold Chain Summit ](https://twitter.com/tomazlevak/status/1006853545549705216)in Tianjin, China.
* We got [featured in an expert shipping journal](https://shippingandfreightresource.com/executive-insights-origintrail-ceo-tomaz-levak-on-new-solutions-to-old-problems/) Shipping and Freight Resource
* We also sent out [a new bi-weekly newsletter](http://preview.mailerlite.com/t9u2f5) it is packed with great content, check it out. If you would like to receive our newsletters to your inbox, you can easily opt-in [here](https://www.subscribepage.com/OriginTrail).

I am delighted to get so much positive feedback for doing these short reports on Reddit and Twitter. Thank you so much, we will keep these updates coming at least three times per week. 

Let’s keep this one as structured as possible. It is 6 am here in HQs, exciting times before the testnet launch. 

Yesterday: 

* Our Partner EVRYTHNG sent us a lovely [shout out on Twitter](https://twitter.com/EVRYTHNG/status/1003980103683100674). It is great to be working with them to deliver brand protection to global supply chains.
* [The monthly report #5: May was published](https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-community-monthly-report-5-may-2018-87070997cd57)  \- It is an extensive piece featuring main highlights and some of our favorite tweets published last month, it is always incredible to see how much can be achieved in a month, such a an epiphany. 

Expected this week: 

* John G. Keogh will share more information on [Vietnam Food Integrity center](https://www.foodnavigator-asia.com/Article/2018/06/04/New-Vietnam-food-centre-seeks-to-improve-traceability-safety-and-standards-in-wake-of-recent-scandals) with us
* A surprise blog post tomorrow
* On Friday, 8th of June, CEO and cofounder Tomaž Leval will speak at [NANJING NEXT SUMMIT Blockchain: The New Industrial Revolution](https://amcham-shanghai.eventbank.cn/event/15077/) organized by AmCham Shanghai. He will be sharing the stage with the director at Deloitte China, JD\- Y blockchain application representative, CTO at Microsoft China, Sr. director, Walmart food safety collaboration center, and chief scientist head of emerging technologies at IBM research \- China [among others](https://amcham-shanghai.eventbank.cn/event/15077/speakers.html).

And maybe more, who knows …?

After the team has successfully deployed testnet last Friday, June 29th, we are heading towards new wins. We announced in the testnet release blog post that summer will be all about progressing with protocol adoption (biz dev updates) and making improvements to the nodes participants experience in testnet beta aiming to create a frictionless process for mainnet in Q3. 

And the first results of post-testnet pace and content are out this week. Here is what we published on Medium and Twitter: 

* The news of the week is [GS1 Slovenia partnership](https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-becomes-official-partner-of-gs1-slovenia-862bfb5563f8): OriginTrail and GS1 Slovenia will cooperate in the field of business support using GS1 standards. We are proud to create and share best practices in introducing the blockchain to global supply chains. 
* Our Co-Founder &amp; CTO[ ](https://twitter.com/branarakic)Branimir Rakić attended [Walmart’s Fresh Retail Innovation Day](https://twitter.com/origin_trail/status/1014780697704312834) in Shenzhen, China. 2nd round of Walmart Food Safety Innovation Pipeline was launched. OriginTrail is proud to be last year’s winner.
* We also published [June report yesterday](https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-community-monthly-report-6-june-2018-22e4d4218af0), listing all 10 events in 7 countries that our team members presented at last month and offer structured updates on protocol adoption and development. [Read it here](https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-community-monthly-report-6-june-2018-22e4d4218af0). 

What next? Next week we expect to publish: 

* Biz dev: At least more meaningful business development update 
* Tech: We will share more news about testnet, further improve accessibility of Houston app and more.  

I also have a more personal update. 

Next week, I will do [a community AMA](https://growthhackers.com/amas/ama-with-maja-voje-cmo-at-origintrail) with my absolutely favorite growth/marketing community founded by Sean Ellis. I am very happy about this. If you have some marketing related questions you are welcome to participate in AMA or simply comment here.

- Simulate a supply chain with 3 companies involved. They share EPCIS Data for Track and Trace.

- RFID-Data-Capture-Application, that can upload EPCIS-data to the ODN (Origintrial) / Blockchain

- Front-End App that can access, process and display EPCIS-Data (basically applying complex queries to the API)

Im not an expert on API's - its sad that i cant find any example or tutorial projects that utilise the API.
The Origintrail-Docu on API is very short and doesn't help much.

I have the following questions to you guys:

- does anyone have an example code on how to use the API of OriginTrails?

- Do you know an alternative blockchain technology for my thesis (storing EPCIS-Data) since OriginTrials gives me troubles due to poor technical documentation.

Im thinking about Hyperledger Fabric but the database technology seems to be bad for interconnected data because of the nature of EPCIS.

- currently, only Etherium is supported for the blockchain layer of OriginTrail right?

- how does the connection between OT and the blockchain layer work (on a technical level)?

- smart contracts are developed with the blockchain layer not with OriginTrials right?

I have followed this coin sporadically for the last few months but have not bought any. I am wanting to establish a position, but am having a hard time getting a feel for the staking mechanism. I get that any number of coins can stake, and the more you have the high the % return. Is there an estimate for various coin counts? For instance:
1,000
5,000
10,000
Etc

If it’s going to take 100,000 or something similar to earn a worthwhile % return I will pass as I don’t have that kind of capital. Let’s call worthwhile 5%

If you are new here, haven't been by in a week or 2, or are just looking for a quick refresher on how the month has gone so far, here are some links to check out:

* [July 5th: OriginTrail Becomes Official Partner of GS1 Slovenia](https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-becomes-official-partner-of-gs1-slovenia-862bfb5563f8) - HUGE NEWS!  This is a big step forward in OriginTrail's relationship with GS1.  Locking up a long-term contract and signing a letter of intent to cooperate in the field of business support using GS1 standards is amazing news.  In addition, GS1 Slovenia is scheduled to attend OriginTrail’s event — the Trace Alliance Congress — in Ljubljana on October 11–12, 2018 as a strategic partner supporting content creation.

* [July 5th: CTO Branimir Rakic attended Walmart’s Fresh Retail Innovation Day in Shenzhen, China](https://twitter.com/origin_trail/status/1014780697704312834) - It is a great for OriginTrail to be back at this event that they won last year!  I really like the continued support for the Walmart Food Safety Collaboration Center.

* [July 6th: OriginTrail is part of EVRYTHNG’s Blockchain Integration Hub launch](https://twitter.com/EVRYTHNG/status/1013854332398309376) - It is great to see this partnership continue to take shape.  Bring on the use cases!

* [July 6th: OriginTrail Community Monthly Report for June 2018 is released](https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-community-monthly-report-6-june-2018-22e4d4218af0) - An awesome summary of OriginTrail's biggest month to date!  In addition to the successful testnet launch, there were 2 additional technology releases, 10 events in 7 countries, and a bunch of updates from the community.

* [July 9th: Living document of all active Use Cases and Partnerships for OriginTrail is released](https://medium.com/@TraceCommunity/living-document-of-all-active-use-cases-and-partnerships-for-origintrail-b81cbbc98c58) - A great summary provided by the community!  Looking through everything that is already ongoing for this project, I am truly looking forward to seeing the continued progress of testnet and will definitely have my node ready to go for mainnet!

* [July 12th: CMO Maja Voje participates in an AMA with GrowthHackers](https://growthhackers.com/amas/ama-with-maja-voje-cmo-at-origintrail) - Want to know more about the best CMO in the industry?  Look no further!  This AMA was really an unexpected treat for me last week.  It is not often that we get to peek inside the mind of someone very impactful and influential.  Definitely a must-read!

I am really looking forward to what the rest of July will bring.  I have a feeling the team will finish the month strong! 

Again, if you haven't become involved in testnet yet, I highly encourage you to do so.  Not only will you help provide valuable data and feedback to the team, but participating will also help you get off to a great start once mainnet launches.

It is recommended to run a VPS when running a node. However VPS are not free. Fortunately Digital Ocean is giving $100 credit, but in the long run it will cost money. 

I understand that there is no Minimum Staking Amount to run a node (and no plans currently to establish tiers for masternodes), but is there any estimate out there or more information about how much one should stake to at least cover the cost of the VPS? (Side note: are there any resources out there talking about the actual costs of running a node?)  I assume that staking just 1 TRAC is not going to cover base costs of a VPS or say energy used by a personal computer.

Speaking of which, what if one were to just run a node on their personal computer? There are obvious downsides to running it on a personal computer such as not having 100% uptime, internet connection loss, or hardware failure. But wouldn't the cost be less than having a VPS?

In July my team was busy launching the Trace Alliance website r/[https://alliance.origintrail.io/](https://alliance.origintrail.io/) and some other projects that I cannot publicly discuss yet.

I initially wrote this summary for the Telegram, but I liked it a lot so I thought that would be a great content to return to Reddit with weekly updates, too.

What did we accomplish last week?

What's up next:

* On Tuesday, we will publish a July's monthly report. In the report, there is a summary of testnet beta program activities.
* The team is also working on updating the roadmap for Q3,  we cannot commit when it is going to be published, but should not be long.
* I will invite more team members to post updates on Reddit so you will get better insights into all the exciting developments at OriginTrail.
* I am also available for questions on Reddit. Nope, I can still not comment on exchanges (and I never will :)), however, you are welcome to ask questions in comments below this post and I will answer them tomorrow.

I was really surprised to hear hear this and still haven't found an answer to my question, so here's another try:*

A few days ago [I placed a similar question on the Ambrosus forum](https://www.reddit.com/r/ambrosus/comments/92lyv8/some_fundamental_questions_concerns_on_ambrosus/) (along with a few others, related to the comparison between Ambrosus and Origin Trail) that I feel also applies to Origin Trail. I'll elaborate; feel free to correct me where I'm wrong.

Origin Trail is a middle ware technology existing of the Origin Trail Data Network (ODN), which is a decentralized network of nodes that can store and handle supply chain data. Therefore, this data isn't stored on an actual blockchain itself (otherwise it would clutter the blockchain in no-time), but fingerprints of the data are stored on a blockchain of choice, e.g. Ethereum. Origin Trail therefore *isn't a blockchain* but utilizes blockchains, making it blockchain agnostic and flexible.

The TRAC token therefore isn't a native blockchain token like BTC, ETH, VET, AMB (soon) etc, but will remain an ERC20 token, meaning it's basically a value-representing unit utilized within the ODN, of which the bookkeeping is done on the Ethereum smart-contract.

TRAC token's are used within the ODN as (1) Medium of Exchange (MoE) for ODN-related transactions (data storage costs, data checks, node incentives) and (2) collateral for nodes to discourage malicious behavior.

The question in the title already gave away where this is going. I'm playing devil's advocate a bit in order to test the underlying rationale for the Origin Trail thesis, and am wondering whether it shouldn't be possible to run Origin Trail's network without the TRAC token and simply utilizing BTC, ETH, dollars or any other coin/token as a MoE and collateral. I'm not a software developer or engineer so there might be a technical reason I'm not aware of for this, if so I'd love to learn why this is - particularly since the rationale above would apply for most current projects in the crypto space. Looking forward to some constructive discussion; trace on!

Edit: To further explain, I think a system where for instance ETH could be used as a currency by enterprises and could be staked directly by nodes, it might lower costs and the threshold for enterprises, as they wouldn't need to buy ETH first (+ fee), swap it for TRAC on an exchange (+ fee) and withdraw it to their own wallet (+ fee). I feel the only alternative is if enterprises would just trade fiat for TRAC tokens directly with nodes via OTC, which I think would have influence on the (speculative) value of TRAC tokens which is based on exchange-rates.

Edit 2: Below the answer from one of the Origin Trail developers. What I take from this is that paying with ETH and staking ETH could be technically possible, but OT made a design choice to create their own token to be able to fund the development of the Origin Trail ecosystem.

This update will be a little different because on Sundays I like to take some time off to reflect on our previous work and make plans to embrace the new opportunities on the horizon.  

In my opinion, OriginTrail does a great job in updating the community what we have we been doing and achieving. We have been praised for that on multiple occasions, for example [here](https://medium.com/neptune-insights/the-complete-guide-to-post-ico-marketing-in-2018-716d99eae3ca). However, the state of the industry at the moment is pivoting from knowing what blockchain is to finding something that actually works and delivers value to companies.

Just this morning Žiga recommended me to read[ this article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelwolfson/2018/08/15/vitalik-buterin-on-the-state-of-ethereum-the-future-of-blockchain-and-google-trying-to-hire-him/#6aa4962558f0), which summarises a panel with Vitalik Buterin. Here is what he has been tackling lately: 

&gt;“Recently, I am spending a lot of time working on the proof-of-stake and sharding protocols. This is what the Ethereum research community is focusing on more than anything else at this point. We think that proof-of-stake and scaling are both really important and there has been a lot of progress on improving the algorithms and the development of multiple limitations over the last couple of months. I’ve also been looking at the economic analysis of transaction fees and how transaction fee algorithms can be improved to basically cut fees down and make the protocol alignment centers better and more efficient. Those are the main things I’ve been working on myself.” 

I was blown away when I was reading this because I found so many similarities to what our senior developer and product owner Vladimir Lelicanin wrote in [his latest testnet update](https://origintrail.community/origintrail-development/origintrail-beta-program-progress-report-and-discussion/). It is another confirmation how cutting-edge OriginTrail’s R&amp;D is. Hands down, guys! Can’t wait for another update.

We have received an awesome feedback to an [Andrew Webster ](https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-advisors-andrew-webster-supply-chain-risk-management-fc1d130fc097)interview that we published on Friday (and the next time I will take the mouse arrow off the screen, promise!). He is an amazing person to talk to and I cannot wait to update the community about the use cases he and his colleagues are developing in maritime and insurance industries once the time is right. 

Since you liked the interview so much, I enthusiastically booked two more interviews. In the following week, we will call two other amazing individuals: 

* Janko Simonović, our senior dev Senior Software Engineer- you maybe know him from [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/wf3mJtp) :) His career record is nothing short of amazing. He has a patent (more about this in an interview). Apart from being an open-source ninja in his spare time, he spearheaded the Reproducible Computational Analyses for Bioinformatics (Rabix) project and worked for companies like Seven Bridges Genomics and Frame. I am super-excited about this one, because he is an amazing person and it is great for the community to meet smart people behind the communication front line in OriginTrail.
* Nemanja Cerovac, a long-time supporter, and friend of OriginTrail started a new exciting job as CMO &amp; CPO at Santiment, an innovative analysis tool for traders and crypto community. We agreed that he will demonstrate an analysis of $TRAC token using their platform on a video call we will have. [See how it all got started on Twitter](https://twitter.com/majavoje/status/1030495673324593153) :) 

What else is in the pipeline? 

Žiga and Tomaž are back from Shanghai and Hong Kong business trip with amazing news, which will be developed further and communicated later on in the autumn. Tomorrow Vladimir and Branimir arrive at HQs to work on something really interesting that I cannot share yet. We will share a photo or two.

Nikita here, head of the Testnet beta program and developer at OriginTrail. 

First of all, I would like to thank you for the valuable insights you share on [Discord ](https://discordapp.com/invite/wf3mJtp)with our team.

Let’s briefly present some exciting updates in OriginTrail’s pipeline. 

* **ADVISOR INTERVIEW**: Yesterday [we were recording an interview ](https://twitter.com/majavoje/status/1029282518468620288)with Mr Andrew Webster, OriginTrail’s Supply Chain Risk Management Advisor and Partner at Jardine Lloyd Thompson - JLT in the United Kingdom. Andrew brings 30 years of experience in broking and supply chain to our board. His excitement for blockchain and OriginTrail use cases in insurance, maritime and supply chains is contagious and he sees a lot of potential. Here is a fun fact: Andrew first heard about OriginTrail from Ken Lyon, OriginTrail’s Supply Chain Advisor who is now the Managing Director at Virtual Partners, in the past he has served as VP &amp; International Information Services Director at UPS Logistics Group. Before we publish the interview with Andrew, you can enjoy two interviews with Ken Lyon [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6PlYu1X1_c) &amp; [blog post](https://medium.com/origintrail/invaluable-experience-from-the-intersection-of-it-and-logistics-a2d482c9581b). 
* **TRACE ALLIANCE:** The Trace Alliance is still receiving many new member applications and executing [its mission](https://medium.com/origintrail/trace-alliance-the-collaborative-hub-for-the-resolution-of-supply-chain-challenges-using-35e3eb9f7d7f) to onboard and connect new members to the ecosystem. You will not have to wait long to learn who the new members of the Trace Alliance are, however, in the future, we will transition to monthly Trace Alliance reports. 
* **TECH UPDATES:** The dev team is working on the test network improvements practically non-stop and announced another tech release with release notes next week. Meanwhile, Senior Software Lead &amp; Product Owner at OriginTrail Vladimir Lelicanin is preparing a cool screenshare just like he discussed on Telegram with community members. You can read this interesting conversation here [https://t.me/OriginTrail/298095](https://t.me/OriginTrail/298095). 

A special shoutout to our head of test network beta program Nikita and his mates who are communicating with node holders every single working day on Discord. Yesterday he [published this post on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/OriginTrail/comments/96wqm6/availability_of_origintrails_dev_team_on_discord/) too with the purpose of better alignment of activities between the time zones.

When I woke up today, I was delighted to receive a nomination from [Central Europe Startup Awards](http://centraleuropeanstartupawards.com/national-finalists-2018/slovenia-national-finalists) for OriginTrail as the blockchain startup of the year and I was nominated in a female category. While it is not a ground-breaking news such as[ Walmart’s Food Safety Innovation Spark Award](https://medium.com/origintrail/awarded-by-walmart-admitted-into-its-inaugural-innovation-program-3b235d85d1e0) that OriginTrail won back in November 2017, it is still amazing to see that our work is valued in a regional ecosystem. Happy for that. 

I wrote [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/OriginTrail/comments/94rxdt/cmo_update_for_reddit_august_5th_2018/) on Sunday. Let’s talk about what is new since then.

* [**July’s report** ](https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-monthly-report-7-july-2018-b0c3e81b6ddf)**was published** and I was super happy because co-founder Žiga Drev [tweeted this lovely thought](https://twitter.com/DrevZiga/status/1026786409414242305) to highlight its importance. 

[TLDR? Here is a snapshot of July's report](https://i.redd.it/hyvuj77qw2f11.jpg)

* Co-founder Žiga Drev was **nominated by AmCham Shanghai** for an entrepreneur of the year and he attended [a wonderful ceremony](https://www.reddit.com/r/OriginTrail/comments/95aloi/origintrails_cofounder_%C5%BEiga_drev_is_nominated_for/), [https://twitter.com/tomazlevak/status/1026782828879478784](https://twitter.com/tomazlevak/status/1026782828879478784) 
* **Vladimir Lelicanin**, Senior Software Lead  &amp; Product Owner is full-stack software developer with 22 years of experience working for top, worldwide brands such as Milka, Jacobs, Qatar Airways, FC Barcelona and SEA Institute. I am pointing this out because he is a kick-ass developer and I find it good that the broader community gets to know him better)  talked to the community on Telegram, he **shared updates on testnet** (also presented in our July’s monthly report) and answered some questions [https://t.me/OriginTrail/298095](https://t.me/OriginTrail/298095) 

[Vladimir presenting at the Enter conference, 2018 ](https://i.redd.it/zjr58bvny2f11.jpg)

* Today we are doing **something fun on Twitter, we are asking 3 questions** (clever ones - not “retweet and win stuff” :)) - and the new holders of OriginTrail’s swag bags will be known tomorrow. This is not an airdrop. Swag bag = branded merch. Pitch in if you’d like [https://twitter.com/origin\_trail](https://twitter.com/origin_trail) &amp; good luck! 

**Tomorrow the team will list new Trace Alliance members** on [Trace Alliance website](https://alliance.origintrail.io/). We will also announce winners of the fun giveaway we are doing tomorrow.  Co-founders Tomaž Levak (CEO) and Žiga Drev (COO) are still in Asia ([here is their recent update](https://www.reddit.com/r/OriginTrail/comments/94ts4v/origintrails_cofounder_%C5%BEiga_drev_stopped_by_on/)) and meanwhile, the team in Belgrade is perfecting the testnet and providing assistance to participants in **OriginTrail decentralized network beta program (testnet) on Discord**\- [INVITE LINK](https://discordapp.com/invite/wf3mJtp).

Last week a strategic workshop with Branimir Rakić, CTO, and Vladimir Lelicanin, Senior Developer &amp; Product Owner who visited Tomaž, Žiga and me in Ljubljana stole all our focus. We initially planned to launch some videos, but the brainstorming flow took over and held us busy till late in the evenings. 

[Workshop snapshot ](https://i.redd.it/4m0ongrf7si11.jpg)

Now we are back on track, business as usual. Here are some things that we plan to launch this week: 

* Testnet update by Branimir Rakić, CTO - stats, developments and recent improvements
* OriginTrail Autumn Roadshow Medium post - we are hitting the road again to evangelise the benefits of decentralized supply chains in 5 different countries - some big events planned as well
* Interview with Janko Simonović our Senior Software Engineer (initially planned for last week - sorry for the delay) His career record is nothing short of amazing. He has a patent (more about this in the interview). Apart from being an open-source ninja in his spare time, he spearheaded the Reproducible Computational Analyses for Bioinformatics (Rabix) project and worked for companies like Seven Bridges Genomics and Frame. I am super-excited about this one, because he is an amazing person and it is great for the community to meet smart people behind the communication front line of OriginTrail. 
* Friday, 31st of August: Tech AMA (yeah, the expression AUA - ask us anything did not really take off - even though I liked it a lot :)) with Branimir Rakic and Vladimir Lelicanin[. Ask questions here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScfJOEWE6zPr-DRw_8ZWCPzk0FrgYivNtL9eEqWh5AfCMuXhg/viewform), there is a chance to win a hoodie. Ask away. [Check in for the live stream here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jtf7PwI5qc&amp;feature=youtu.be), you’ll get a reminder 

What else is in the pipeline? We are working on our roadmap, new members are joining the Trace Alliance and no later than the 7th of September we will launch the August report.

September is packed with [Autumn Roadshow](https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrails-autumn-roadshow-high-level-industry-events-around-the-world-91a904580e52) events, and the team is working hard to finish Q3 successfully and enter Q4. One of the activities was a workshop we had in Belgrade last week, here is a snapshot.

https://i.redd.it/wils1sz6trm11.jpg

&amp;#x200B;

All co-founders were presenting at events last week. Žiga Drev spoke at the [blockchain panel at GS1’s global event](https://twitter.com/DrevZiga/status/1039874639714037762) in Dublin, Tomaž Levak presented at the [National Logistics Forum in Ljubljana](https://twitter.com/origin_trail/status/1039842562293551104), Slovenia and Branimir Rakić had a talk at TEDx Mokrin in Serbia. We also had the first [Trace Alliance](https://alliance.origintrail.io/) webinar for the members.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/t7hehiyhtrm11.jpg

This week we are planning: 

* The report from GS1’s global annual flagship gathering, the [Industry &amp; Standards Event 2018](https://standards-event.gs1.org/)
* Trace Alliance update: we expect to announce the completion of the milestone outlined in the roadmap - 50+ Members of Trace Alliance
* Meet the dev team: Interview with Nebojša Obradović, Senior Software Engineer &amp; [TomTom](https://www.tomtom.com/) alum
* Our team will also speak at two events: OriginTrail’s CEO Tomaž will take part in the Blockchain panel on [Food's Future Summit](https://www.foods-future.com/) in Hong Kong and Head of Business development Nino Pirtovšek will present at Cutting Edge of Digital Mind event organised by Faculty of Economics, University of Ljubljana. 

Next week, 24-30 September, we plan to launch two exciting projects to successfully close[Q3 2018](https://origintrail.io/roadmap)

* Open call for supply chain use cases based on blockchain: We will present an open call project, which will support 10 high-potential use cases joining OriginTrail mainnet.
* OriginTrail Network Explorer v1

And more …  There is always more.

Welcome to the last week of September, which will bring two exciting launches by OriginTrail. 

To wrap up Q3, this week we will launch: 

* **Open call for supply chain use cases** based on blockchain - we will invite projects aspired to use the OriginTrail open-source protocol on mainnet to participate in the open call. Token holders will select 10 best projects, which will be rewarded and mentored.
* **OriginTrail Network Explorer v1** 

Now, I gotta take a deep breath before I start writing what has been done last week because we have been on a launching spree again. Last week all of this (and more :)) happened: 

* The most popular Medium post on social media last week was the announcement of [50+ Trace Alliance members ](https://medium.com/origintrail/trace-alliance-now-has-more-than-50-members-dc3701809209)
* We are thrilled to have a chance to do a webinar[ Enabling Businesses to Speak the Same Language with the Blockchain](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/16693/336266) at a popular education platform BrightTalk. Co-founders Tomaž Levak and Žiga Drev will present OriginTrail to a business audience.[ You are welcome to attend the webinar](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/16693/336266). It is free of charge. 
* A report [OriginTrail at GS1 Events: Dublin &amp; Ljubljana](https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-at-gs1-events-dublin-ljubljana-cd8408716b2f) \- we are honored to have participated in a blockchain panel at GS1’s global annual flagship gathering, the Industry &amp; Standards Event 2018. more GS1 events are coming up this autumn, stay tuned.
* OriginTrail’s CEO Tomaž took part in the[ Blockchain panel on Food's Future Summit in Hong Kong](https://twitter.com/origin_trail/status/1043140856633589760). 
* Meet the dev team: [Interview with Nebojša Obradović, Senior Software Engineer ](https://medium.com/origintrail/interview-with-neboj%C5%A1a-obradovi%C4%87-origintrail-senior-software-engineer-2be959d115a1)&amp; TomTom alum was published on Medium and YouTube.
* We presented OriginTrail at [Cutting Edge of Digital Mind event organised by the Faculty of Economics](https://twitter.com/origin_trail/status/1043110333274103809), University of Ljubljana.
* One of the Trace Alliance members published an insightful article [Six Ways Blockchain is Being Used in Food and Agriculture Supply Chains](https://medium.com/cultivati/six-ways-blockchain-is-being-used-in-food-and-agriculture-supply-chains-68a7305fd533). It got a very nice traction on LinkedIn. 
* Our newsletter was sent out on Friday. If you would like to receive our short bi-weekly update (core news) to your inbox, [you are welcome to subscribe](https://www.subscribepage.com/OriginTrail). 

This week our team is working on two important launches. We will also update you from [2050 China Food Tech Summit](https://www.2050chinafoodtechsummit.com/) where co-founder &amp; CTO Branimir Rakić will be presenting at blockchain session in Shanghai along the executives from PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, Carrefour, PwC, IDEO, and other reputable companies and experts.

Have a great week.

We started the week with the [Testnet progress overview](https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-testnet-progress-update-eab09d84c101) blog post by co-founder and CTO Branimir Rakić and continued with the announcement of the [Autumn Roadshow](https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrails-autumn-roadshow-high-level-industry-events-around-the-world-91a904580e52) (highlights: GS1 Blockchain Panel in Dublin and Blockchain Technology Session: Decentralizing Food Supply Chains at the 2050 China Food Tech Summit in Shanghai). Later on, we published an [interview](https://medium.com/origintrail/interview-with-janko-simonovi%C4%87-origintrail-senior-software-engineer-f5dbaabd589e) with our senior developer and software architect Janko Simonović. It hides a content gem, a [video demonstration of node resilience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD673FB58Gg) in OriginTrail Decentralized Network. Finally, on Friday we had a technical AMA for the community with Branimir Rakić and our senior developer and product owner Vladimir Lelićanin which you can watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jtf7PwI5qc&amp;feature=youtu.be). 

This week will be no less exciting, we are planning to publish: 

* Tech AMA Summary for those of you who prefer reading to watching :)  
* The team will update the roadmap and 
* We will publish the August monthly report no later than on the 7th of September.
