&amp;nbsp;

My brother and I just launched a new website, [CoinBerries.com](http://coinberries.com), to help people learn about many of the top cryptocurrencies by providing concise and (hopefully) accurate descriptions for each coin. Right now, the process of learning about new cryptocurrencies is time intensive and typically involves going to multiple sources (e.g., company website, news sources, reddit pages) to get a clearer idea of exactly what each coin does.

&amp;nbsp;

For many casual learners or for people who don’t have the time to look at every coin, it’s difficult to keep up and stay engaged without becoming a bit overwhelmed. To help address this, we’ve created [CoinBerries.com](http://coinberries.com) as an educational resource for people to discover and learn about the top coins traded today in a concise and structured manner.

&amp;nbsp;

To make Coin Berries as useful as possible, we're asking communities around each cryptocurrency for help to ensure the information we present is accurate and relevant going forward. 

&amp;nbsp;

Below you’ll find the current description and category we have listed for BitShares on our site and additional pieces of information we plan to add for each coin in the coming days. Given that this community has a lot more intimate knowledge about BitShares, we would be extremely grateful for your feedback and thoughts on the descriptions &amp; information provided, the usability / functionality of our website, and ultimately the usefulness of our website overall. Any and all feedback is welcome and we plan to keep you in the loop on any revisions made based on this discussion :)

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks so much!


Brian &amp; Eric

I just invested into the project for the first time at a very cheap price, I am so happy towards the analysis. Ill tell you why.

Firstly I want to come through this down here to the guys who believe in the concept of the project for a while now. Some of you hodling at a lost, everyday feeling more and more dissatisfied. This is for you true believers before all of this goes viral, you damn reddit watchers!

Holes to fill:
1. Bitshares have been lost to the western community for awhile.
2. China is having some exchange problems.
3. Since the gold rush of April/May/June '17, bitshares has not been on the minds of most of these new speculators due to lack of excitement or big news.
4. I actually believe the name is putting investers off, It does sound sort of a like a B-class version of bitcoin from far. I know this sounds ridiculous, but how much research does the average gold rush investor look into each of the pool of names and abbreviations.
5. USD-Tether is getting a lot of bad publicity lately, I know some whales having a trouble avoiding these latest crashes due to lack of trust in tether.

Corks to fill holes:
1. Western community has never before looked at the problems Chinese investors face and their approach as much, as the last week.
2. Do you really know how well known bitshares is in China compared to the english side? Have you seen the trading pairs actually used on the DEX?
3. What created the biggest kickstart for Antshares :) ??/??
4. The fact that you can trade $/Euro/Yuan directly to smartcoins and the amount is locked up
5. BTS is a 1/4 from its ATH, has anything fundamentally changed?

Cam someone please explain to me the https://door.one/en/ ???

Can anyone explain this in detail because no one including bitshare is giving any real details, we are all just guessing at this point, usually thats the first redflag of FOMO hype.

We recently saw Bitshares at 1500, here i will try to explain you on my opinion how it could hapenned..
Personally i have a huge loss on Bitshares around 75% of my capital, yes i opened huge long on Poloniex and didn`t stop loss...

So what`s hapened? 
First of all Bitshares would not be traded on China anymore, so me have less demand on the market.
How we fall to 1500 ? 

I think there are 3 factors here :
1. Chineese dump
2. Bitcoin Correction
3. Margin Trading Automatic closing Long positions.

I will go directly to point 3 &gt; 
We all know that 2800, 2900, 3000 was `` good price `` for BTS
So people like me opened Long Positions on this area. 
So when we had less demand on BTS due to BTC correction, price starts to move down and occur to closing Long positions.
In order to close your long position or stop loss you have to sell, and it`s triggered a huge wave of sell and olso liquidation of long positions.

How we get 2500 so fast ?

People who opened short positions starts to close it after Bull RUN, thats how the price move up so fast.

I get rekt 2500$ Loss on this move feels bad man.

If someone could donate would be cool...

But what does that mean?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; *“Bitcoin is processing a bit less than 3 transactions per second,” he said. “Ethereum is doing five a second. Uber gives 12 rides a second. It will take a couple of years for the blockchain to replace Visa.”* – quote from the TechCrunch article.

&amp;nbsp;

Kind of weird there is no mention of Graphene-based chains. Like BitShares, yes.

&amp;nbsp;

﹡﹡﹡

&amp;nbsp;

Well, in December 2016, Visa told MyBroadband that VisaNet processes an average of 150 million transaction each day. [Source.](https://mybroadband.co.za/news/security/190348-visanet-handling-100000-transactions-per-minute.html) Say, it's around 1,700 transaction per second on average.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; *“Based on rigorous testing, we estimate that VisaNet is capable of processing more than 56,000 transaction messages per second,”* said Visa.

&amp;nbsp;

That's it. What about BitShares? What it's all about, what it can offer? Today.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; *While people think in terms of transactions, BitShares thinks in terms of operations. A transfer is a single operation that transfers funds from one account to another. Other operations include: create account, create limit order, issue asset, create asset, etc.* – the quote from the official BitShares blog.

&amp;nbsp;

So, how it compares with, say, 1,700 to 2,000 transaction per second of Visa?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; *A transaction consists of one or more operations that must execute together or not all.*

&amp;nbsp;

With the latest stress test, which was done 5 months ago, BitShares has proven to sustain successfully about 300 transaction per second on average, with a peak of more than 3000 transaction per second, which **beats PayPal** and which is already like **8x to 15x of what Ethereum is able to handle today** (there is different data available on how much Ethereum handles but it varies from 5 TPS to 20–40 TPS, and we count the greatest).

&amp;nbsp;

﹡﹡﹡

&amp;nbsp;

But then, what does it mean in terms of operations? As was stated before, in BitShares a transaction can consist of more than one operation:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; *Similar to Bitcoin allowing to bundle multiple outputs, but with the option to execute different smart contracts offered by the blockchain sequentially. The easiest application is similar to Bitcoin’s multi-send feature where a single user sends bitcoins to many addresses.*

&amp;nbsp;

During the stress test which was done in April 2017, various parameters were adjusted on the fly to push the system to the limits. Such parameters as block confirmation time, which was decreased to 2 seconds and then to 1 second during the test (10 times faster than block confirmation times of Ethereum and 500 times faster than Bitcoin's).

&amp;nbsp;

Also, various number of operations was allowed to be bundled into a single transaction during the test. Thus the number of operations in that stress test differs from the number of transactions. The stress test has shown that the blockchain is able to handle **more than 2,500 operations per second on average** with various peaks in a **range of 10,000 to 20,000 operations per second**. So, as we see, what BitShares does can be comparable to what Visa does today.

&amp;nbsp;

For the next stress test the testers plan to improve the system making it run fully smooth with 1 second block confirmation time (which was fine for some parts of the test and a bit delayed for the other). It likely renders the blockchain to the true realtime experience, while today it fully operates with 3 second confirmation times successfully on the mainnet.

&amp;nbsp;

﹡﹡﹡

&amp;nbsp;

Now, what about that VisaNet is claimed to scale up to “56,000 transaction messages per second”, you ask. For BitShares, is that the limit what is shown here?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; *Great claims require great evidence and the claim that BitShares is capable of 100,000 transactions per second has probably raised a few eyebrows.*

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; *Therefore, for the purposes of our benchmarks we assume all transactions contain exactly one operation and that measuring operations per second is equivalent to measuring transactions per second.*

&amp;nbsp;

I'll leave some source links below for those who want to dive more deep in that, and who are interested about of how BitShares is ready for the future in terms of scalability.

As a payment gateway dealing with cryptocurrencies only, our team at CoinGate are very happy about their growing popularity. For quite a long time we worked with Bitcoin payments only, but we eventually came to realize that it’s no longer just Bitcoin that is important. 

Contrary to some people, we believe that cryptocurrencies should not just be regarded as tokens or assets, but also should serve a purpose in making everyday payments. As the crypto-payments industry is still tiny compared to conventional payment methods, it is quite difficult, however, to inform people about the possibility to pay with cryptocurrencies, and convince them it is worth the effort.

So, we have come here to this subreddit to let you know that due to our integration with ShapeShift we allow our merchants to accept many cryptocurrencies, including BTS! 

Our team are certain that the so-called altcoins with their rapidly growing value have huge potential in becoming relevant for casual payments online. As such, we are preparing on the future and are currently working on our invoices to make the payment experience with BitShares and other cryptocurrencies smooth and friendly to casual users (an upgrade is going live very soon). 

Actually, if you use cryptos for making payments online, but never thought it’s possible to pay with BTS too, let your favorite merchants know about CoinGate and our payment processing service - we would be super happy if you did!

Kind regards,
CoinGate Team

&amp;nbsp;

[STEALTH tokens](http://cryptofresh.com/a/STEALTH) represent a [Fee Backed Asset (FBA)](http://docs.bitshares.org/bitshares/user/fba.html) that will be bought back with 60% of all fees from stealth or confidential transfers.

&amp;nbsp;

The FBA distribution is automated by smart-contract utilizing BitShares native blockchain feature which allows multiple operations per single transaction to be executed.

No good. So I tried sites that just give you a bitcoin deposit address and auto purchase BTS for you. But the markup was absurd. Why can't bitshare's exchange sell you a very tiny portion of bitshares when you deposit btc? Then you spend those to exchange your btc into bts?

Bag holder here long term. Lots of noise, panic and worry floating about the last month or so. I wanted to weigh in on it and maybe help lessen some fears.


While what i say here could be construed as speculation and a little naive, i do believe what i say. Its all my oppinions and i can give sources to those that ask. Right now i'm voicing my own thoughts.


We saw a massive surge in June, that was linked to China's FUD about crypto in general ten odd months ago. That played at the time right into the Dex's hands with a surge of popularity. 


A similar, but not so severe case happened in 2014, it was riding a high of 0.00009000(Sats_ and plummeted to about 300(Sats) over the course of three years. Then it surged during the aftermath of Chinese government FUD to a sky high 0.00014713.


I picked mine up at 4500ish sats. Then it dropped to 3500 and fluctuated between 3500 and 2500 for a long while. Looked like a case of consolidation and accumulation and a whole heap of suppression.


I think the suppression played a part in why its gotten so bad now. Groups and whales keeping the price down and gobbling up as much as possible at low prices. They played that game a little too long, and a little to hard. It led to many (I don't want to say weak) bag holders fleeing, selling off at big losses. Its a shame but it happens on nearly all coins.


Not sure if anyone here got hit by the BTS-ETH fairy that bought up massive amount of BTS above normal price 3x times in the last few months on Bittrex. That should tell you that people know that this coin is going places. 


Once BTC corrected to $2800 last month coupled with the suppression of BTS it cascaded into a downward spiral of value and then Trex jumped in with a delisting alert. In come the panic sellers. 


A perfect storm really. Very unfortunate.


But i still hold, not out of blind faith. I think we will see a resurgence due to people moving to the DEX. We needed that to happen one way or another. Dex is the heart of BTS and many people traded it on centralized exchanges instead. I think that is down to a lack of varied trading pairs. We need more trades on the DEX, more volume and more trading pairs. This is the hard bumpy road to getting that, its essentially pushed people to come home. 


More centralized exchanges like Bittrex and Polo will be held under scrutiny going forward by the userbase. Polo losing its private key to its cold storage (Supposedly)in august causing its own panic and decreased value.They found it again, but the damage was done. 


In my view while both Trex and Polo take fees from BTS transactions, neither want to have a competitor listed, as BTS has its own DEX it IS direct competition to these exchanges. 
Bittrex claimed it could not support BTS nodes, but declined help from Bitshares to configure the back-end correctly. 


Trex stated that it would be de-listed on the 13th today. But its still trading. 
You would think they would lock it down for trades and prompt people to move their bags off safely. Seems a little suspect how they are handling the desisting of it.


Anyway.


This will lead more people to the DEX. We need that, we need to recommend any BTS bag holders that will listen to move their trading to the DEX. 
Its like a pattern that is repeating.We are at the low point again but i see that reversing coming into January 2018. That coupled with the coming BTS/EOS collaboration will only strengthen our positions. We also have the migration of Bitspark to BTS happening as we speak. 


We hold a unique coin with a unique DEX and a bright future. We just need to stick out this rough patch and promote and use our DEX. Do not let the FUD and current situation scare you away, don't sell at an extreme loss we will come back from this just like in the past. 


If you see a post with panic about centralized exchanges from BTS bag holders. Tell them they have a home that will not leave them stuck, send them to the Dex. 


We have the Tech, the Dex, Partnerships and a bright future. Try not to lose faith if you have stuck it out this far. 

All the love and luck to you guys and girls.

NOTE: I'm willing to pay for consultation services if this requires in-depth Q&amp;A!

From my research, this is basically how an ICO works:

 * create a currency on the BitShares platform (let's call it FOOBAR)
 * the company creates an account to receive token ""purchases""; they make this address available on their website
 * people register with your website (name, email, and their account/wallet address); when the ICO begins, people send ETH or BITC to the wallet address
 * the company then does verification (amount sent, amount avail, etc) and sends the equivalent FOOBAR to the purchasers account or wallet address

  Does this sound like the gist of it?  If so, from a technical side of things:

 * Does the bitshares API allow for displaying the contents of accounts?  (For example, it would be great if I could display the # of FOOBAR remaining or perhaps show the company, visually, how much ETH/BITC they've generated so far)
 * This seems like a very manual process. Is there an automated way of doing this?
 * Am I oversimplifying the process or is this really how its done?",NA,"788lud",NA,0,NA,"false",1510469815,"false","self","t5_2ykpf","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/BitShares/comments/788lud/anyone_have_experience_with_running_an_ico/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

Can I move my BTS to my Bitshares account and it will be stored on it, or do I have to keep it in say a desktop wallet and only access it when I would like to make a trade?

Also, I see a lot of speculation that the SEC is cracking down on cryptocurrencies that act like securities, what makes BTS similar to securities? I thought there had to be a dividend paid out per share for it to classified as a security, and I am not seeing anything about that based on the info I have been able to find about it online, much of which is in the vein of ""It can do ANYTHING!"" Or is this more based on the function of the Smarttokens that are seeking to be issued via the DEX?

I have a bunch of PTS stuck on poloniex under ""temporarily disabled"" for a long time now.

I can't withdraw or anything.

Is there anything I can do? 

Their reply:
Unfortunately from time to time our wallets require maintenance to ensure their continuing functionality and security. I understand this may be frustrating but unfortunately this is just the nature of such wallets, which can be temperamental and require much TLC to be kept running smoothly.

Any deposits you have made will be safe on the blockchain and will be credited as soon as the wallet is active again.

Once the wallet now re-enabled it should be functioning as normal and all your withdrawals will go through. Thank you for your patience and understanding. 

Sincerely,
Poloniex Support Team

As a cryptocurrency enthusiast since 2013, I've seen many different wallet designs and I have to say Bitshares is a good one.  I downloaded the wallet from the homepage, and was off and running.  

The only thing that confused me a little was choosing an account name.  There didn't seem to be clear parameters as to the format of this account name, but once I tried a few combinations, I was able to create an account name that I will remember, which is actually really nice. Transactions confirmed very quickly and trading on the DEX is hardly different than trading on Polo or Bittrex.  

After my experience today, I now understand why people are so excited about BTS, and I now share their excitement.  From a user perspective, I found it was easy to set up a wallet (where I control the keys), transfer BTS from a centralized exchange (super fast transaction and confirmation), buy and sell BTS on the DEX, and transfer BTS out of the DEX (my wallet).

Decentralized Exchanges are likely to increase in popularity in the future, and as someone else said, We now have decentralized currencies, why do we trade them on a centralized exchange?

* ""Top Markets"" lists are completely different. In the Bitshares wallet, the top market is BTS/bitUSD, which I get. In OpenLedger, the top market is for CVCoin, which I've never heard of. None of the listed top markets are for bitUSD.
* Under Settings / Access, the nodes are different. 
* Under Deposit / Withdraw, Bitshares has more gateways / bridges.

When you try to create an account on Cryptofresh, it just redirects to OpenLedger. So Cryptofresh is not an actual wallet? Why is it listed on Coinmarketcap?

Dear users：

In the near future，we found that some users' bitcoin transactions have been slow to be confirmed because of the Bitcoin's gridlocked trading network.We apologize for pay the unjustified Bitcoin miner's cost.

In response to this problem, the AEX team made an emergency discussion and decided to pay the additional costs to accelerating the confirmation of bitcoin.We have contacted the famous domestic mineral pool called Viabtc to provide this service.

To avoid this kind of problem and to improve the speed of BTC transfer, we will make the following improvements:

1.Adjust the cost of the miners at any time according to the traffic congestion.

2.In subsequent versions, we will package the user's money transfer.At the same time, the user's money transfer is always packaged together to make the best use of our miners' expense, so that the speed of user transfer will be significantly improved, and the platform will bear the cost of the miners.

AEX.com will continue to improve our products and services. Thank you for your continued support.

I would really appreciate any help. I have some bitshares in a wallet at wallet.bitshares.org. 

In the shortest amount of steps possible. I do not care about fees. Can someone tell me step by step the easiest way to convert or sell my bts on the exchange and send BTC over to my bitcoin.com wallet? Again, the easiest way to get my BTS from wallet.bitshares.org.. changed into BTC sold/converted whatever.. and sent to a BTC wallet at bitcoin.com. 

Please give extremely simple instructions as though you were explaining the steps to a drooling idiot. This stuff is apparently way higher than my pay grade. 

Here is what I have tried so far using small transfer amounts for testing. Feel free to tell me what I did wrong but please remember.. I just want it transferred as quickly and easily as possible so the actual step by step would really help me more.

First I went in exchange and sold a small amount of bts for openBTC. I then tried to send the openBTC to the bitcoin.com wallet and it disappeared. It says that it is in an openledger-wallet but I did put in the address of the bitcoin.com wallet. Never got to wallet but openBTC is gone from the bts/exchange/wallet.

I then tried to use the Blocktrade bridge and set the dropdowns under ""withdrawal"" to BTS 100. ---&gt; BTC .000235 I then clicked on the ""withdraw now"" button. A window popped up and said ""withdraw Bitcoin (BTC)"", the amount to withdraw was filled out as well as the fee. There was a space for the ""withdraw to address"" so I went to my bitcoin.com wallet, clicked on receive, chose the BTC wallet I wanted the crypto in and copied the address it generated  for me. I then put that address in the ""withdraw to address"" box and clicked on the ""withdraw"" button. Nothing happened. I tried this process several times, even regenerating another wallet address from bitcoin.com and every time absolutely nothing happened when I clicked on the ""withdraw"" button. 

I tried a few other things that were annoying and probably pretty stupid that I won't go into. I will say that somehow I now have 50. USD BTS somehow whatever that is. 

Please take mercy upon me and help a brother out! Please! I am clearly missing something obvious?

It can effectively solve the problem of bitcoin due to price fluctuation, which is difficult for the ambassador to get the business to use. In the two aspects of convenience and usability, it has strong protrusion.

Due to the large price fluctuation of bitcoin, in the virtual currency and currency trading market, it is urgent that price fluctuation is small, credit payment is stable, and the use scenario is richer.

The Bitcoin Platinum will be split at a height of 496525 in Bitcoin block.The general time is around November 28th(GMT+8). However, the official temporarily changed the block height to 498533, so the fork time is expected to be delayed until around December 11(GMT+8).
  
Work arrangement
 
a. The distribution of the Bitcoin Platinum
Before the Fork we will launch a snapshot of BTC user assets. When the Fork succeeds, the user who took the BTC asset at the time of the snapshot was given the split coin .
 
b. Recharge, withdrawal
After the Bitcoin Platinum has no replay attack risk and the block network is stable, we will open up the charge of the Bitcoin Platinum as soon as possible.
 
c. Bitcoin deposits and cash withdrawals
To prevent replay attack and Rollback attack, we will stop the charging and withdrawal of bitcoins before the hard fork. Reinstated and the time of the withdrawal, as the bitcoin network stabilizes.
 
Note: If split ends fail, or encounter an irresistible risk. The AEX platform reserves the right to do not collect the coin and to terminate the online transaction
 
Risk Warning
 
a. AEX will stop BTC recharge and withdrawal before and after Hard fork. You are advised to refill the BTC in advance, in case an emergency is not worth it.
 
b. Digital asset transactions have high risks. Stay cautious and invest in your own risk.

I am admittedly paranoid from years in the crypto markets, but what is going on here? Poloniex does the lion's share of volume for BTS so someone could reasonably spend a small amount to pump the price on other exchanges while heavily dumping their coins on Poloniex. The disparity increases buying interest on Polo, selling interest is capped because nobody can deposit, and holders will be rightly skeptical to dump their coins at such a discount to other markets.

Back in October, with the old wallet system, I created a bitshare account and transferred my bts from bittrex to there. Now I logged back on to the wallet website and it says it has migrated to a new web wallet and that I need to move my wallet there, it also detects a local wallet and lets me do a backup in .bin.

My problem lies when I try to do that. It seems my password is not working. 

Now my question/issue lies here, I have no memory of ever creating a password, and have no backup or writing in my notebook about any such thing, which is something I always have. I’m having a distinct memory of when I created the account I was wondering in the settings (quite confused) how to make a backup but could lock and unlock my wallet with no password and I attributed it all to being the browser based thing.

Am I crazy and terrible memory? I’ve found quite a few people online who say they also have no memory of ever creating a password back then and now it’s not working, or their saved passwords not working. Did their update mess up something on their end or are we just all crazy? I’ve never had something like this happen and would appreciate any kind of help to remember what the steps were to create an account back then and how I could not remember my password after only a month.

Thanks a lot",NA,"7fed9x",NA,0,NA,"false",1512304239,"false","self","t5_2ykpf","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/BitShares/comments/7fed9x/need_help_with_my_account_from_old_version/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

So, if one has a cloud wallet I was informed that there is no backup file you keep, its just your password written down. Correct? 
There is no option to backup in the settings menu, when using a cloud login.

Also if i switch from cloud wallet to local wallet in settings what would happen? 
Is local wallet safer? 
Is there a file to save as backup with a local wallet login?

The Lighting Bitcoin will be split at a height of 499999 in Bitcoin block.The fork time is expected to be delayed until around December 23(GMT+8).
  
Work arrangement
 
a. The distribution of the Lighting Bitcoin
Before the Fork we will launch a snapshot of BTC user assets. When the Fork succeeds, the user who took the BTC asset at the time of the snapshot was given the split coin .
 
b. Recharge, withdrawal
After the Lighting Bitcoin has no replay attack risk and the block network is stable, we will open up the charge of the Lighting Bitcoin as soon as possible.
 
c. Bitcoin deposits and cash withdrawals
To prevent replay attack and Rollback attack, we will stop the charging and withdrawal of bitcoins before the hard fork. Reinstated and the time of the withdrawal, as the bitcoin network stabilizes.
 
Note: If split ends fail, or encounter an irresistible risk. The AEX platform reserves the right to do not collect the coin and to terminate the online transaction
 
Risk Warning
 
a. AEX will stop BTC recharge and withdrawal before and after Hard fork. You are advised to refill the BTC in advance, in case an emergency is not worth it.
 
b. Digital asset transactions have high risks. Stay cautious and invest in your own risk.

3. who are witness? 
 1. what is there job?

about the exchange:

1. why are there such big differences in price? when writing this, EOS price on bitfinex is 1.88 USD and on bitshare it's 2.02 UDS
2. when i buy btc in an exchange and i try to transfer to my wallet, it can take days, there also problems with other coins. is this problem also prevalent in bitshare ?

I've looked in to different exchanges and i haven't seen much about bitshare, why do you think that is?

A few months ago I transferred my BTS from an exchange to the cloud wallet.  Just now went to transfer my BTS back to an exchange and it is asking me for a password- I go to where I keep all my crypto related keys and passwords and I can't find anything BTS related there.  

Is there any way this could be user error?  I don't see how I could've neglected to backup my password- I'm very diligent about these things, is there a step that maybe I haven't done in my wallet (I have access to and can see the BTS amount and public key and all that info) to generate my password?  Any advice?  

Edit:
Thanks for the info.

Please use this as a reminder to double check your key/password systems- I thought my system was rock solid and having set up wallets for different tokens, I guess I got comfortable and careless and missed something along the way.

Half the initial target price bit shares will reach Gerbaud currency, before this, the preferred investment bit stock returns will be very good. Further in-depth analysis, there will be three big forces in the future digital monetary circles. One is the BTC bitcoin, which is the main international transfer account, the two is the ETH intelligent trading contract, the three is the location of the BTS bit share.

From the rate of return analysis, the previous two have achieved a qualitative leap, thousands of prices, creating an incredible myth of investment. At the end of history, block chain trading volume ranks the world's first bit shares, in the promotion of foresight funds under the shock of the subject will be all kinds of mining applications, will be the return of the king, the investment is undoubtedly the most imaginative space! Perhaps in the future, the hundred dollar bit is not a dream!

edit:

Just providing an update for anyone looking into this.   
A recent medium post was made that clears up a lot.  https://medium.com/@AriseBank/arisebank-isnt-a-scam-it-s-a-victim-of-libel-and-slander-d30ed800f483

Since the original post I have also joined the telegram group [arisechat](t.me/arisechat) which is a great group.  I have see a lot of activity from Stan Larimer there as well as a lot of other familiar names from the BitShares community which has put my mind at ease about it.

I also really liked [Jared's recent reply to the Texas Banking Commisioner](https://steemit.com/arisebank/@wallop/arise-governance-we-the-people-a-response-to-the-texas-banking-commissioner)

So at this point to answer my question I do not believe Arise Bank to be a scam.

I already got my account/identity verified by OpenLedger, and can now see the withdraw/deposit links for OpenLedger in the BitShares wallet, but I'm not 100% sure how I would proceed when I am ready to sell. Let's say I have 10k BTS in my wallet:

* Current balance in open.USD shows as 0. Is this the same thing as bitUSD that I can trade my BTS for in the Exchange tab, or is it something different? If so, how do I get some open.USD from my BitShares?
* If I click on Withdrawal under Fiat, I have to enter the amount of open.USD. But how do I know the right amount if I just want to liquidate all my BTS?
* How long after you do the withdrawal does OpenLedger usually take to actually deposit in your bank account?

Thanks for helping me understand the process a little bit better.

With all the theories going on with insider trading with Coinbase, exchanges pumping prices, and future government regulations, it’s just a matter of time before people start losing trust and faith in the centralized exchanges (especially if these theories are true). 

With BitShares DEX, since the whole exchange is decentralized, these problems are eliminated. 

There are a lot of other benefits to BitShares that you can research on the BitShares subreddit, but I see this being the future of the crypto market that could actually be adopted by large banks and used in the future. 

With only a $1.6B market cap and the price around $0.60, don’t miss out because I predict this coin going over $100B+ market cap someday putting it at about $60+ a coin. A $1000 investment would be $100,000 if it reached that high. 

I’ve read that with the growth of the crypto market, some analysts predict it going as high as $800B market cap putting the price at $300+

If you’re looking for the next bitcoin, this is it. I have about 70% of my portfolio into BitShares. 

Check out this guy Haejin, he seems very bright and is very bullish about BTS.

To the moon guys!","Hello everyone! Hope you all are going good today :)

I will just give a little summary on how you can buy BitShares (BTS) very fast. I will link a video you can follow and write a little step by step guide. Remember, there are multiple ways to do this, but this is one way.

1. Register a user on Coinbase [https://www.coinbase.com/]
(https://www.coinbase.com/join/569e63ed705bf25f2500020d)] Use this link and get 10 USD after your first 100 USD purchase

2. Buy X amount of Bitcoin (BTC) or Etherium (ETH) This is cheaper

3. Register a Binance or other exchange account [https://www.binance.com/](https://www.binance.com/?ref=12695653)]

4. After the registration go to your BTC or ETH wallet in the exchange. Find your DEPOSIT phrase.

5. Copy the BTC/ETH deposit phrase from Binance and copy it. Go over to Coinbase and press ""send/recieve"". Now press send and paste your deposit phrase into the BTC/ETH adress send section.

6. Confirm all the steps

7. Wait for your money to go into your Binance account
    When the money is in your BTC wallet on Binance, go to trade/exchange on the website.

8.Find BitShares (BTS)/ BTC or BTS/ETH and go to the buy section.
    Find the right price and right amount for you. I will link a video below showing you how to use Binance even better.

9. Profit? Now, remember to have a very high level of security on all of your accounts. Use 2FA with Authy, Dashlane or Lastpass to password generation, faster and safer login and backup of passwords etc. SECURITY SHOULD ALWAYS BE PRIO 1! Find a wallet that suites you the best.

This transaction cannot be found in the explorer of any bitshares client, but can be found in cryptofresh.
I think that cryptofresh keeps a broken cache.
When will cryprtofresh correct its blockchain and I can contact zb exchange to get my refund?

From what I can see, there's no team page on the official Bitshares site. If I look at the contributors on Github, there's two young fellows, one with almost no history and another guy whose commit log is all over Steem and other completely unrelated things.  I don't really see a committed, seasoned team here with a 3 year roadmap. This feels like a popular hobby project that kinda took off. Thats not to say the founding team isn't capable, but the enterprise demands a certain pace and personnel that's clearly missing.

The smart money goes to serious teams, and Bitshares just isn't there yet. If you want people to take this project seriously, get a board together with some finance people and allow more people to contribute to Git.

These are legitimate question coming from the frame of understanding Bitshares. I’m baffled that you would lock my last thread — you would think you would ENCOURAGE people to understand how your cryptocurrency works!**

I am asking my questions, once again, with more added too to gain clarity.

So here we go:

So I have heard that Bitshares uses a snapshot system only keeping the last ""x"" number of blocks. How many blocks is this?

Also, when was this system created (the snapshot system where fuller  nodes only need to keep the most recent transactions?) I am looking for the actual date (or approximate date) when this upgrade took place.

In addition, I have also seen on the bitshares forums that people say the full blockchain IS needed for full nodes, and there it is very difficult to find abundant info about bitshares snapshot system.


And one more thing- full nodes seem to already require 40GB of ram as I saw in the Github- I imagine this too would increase significantly it bitshares blockchain increased in size yes? If so, I imagine this would certainly be an issue for scalability (imagine the blockchain 100x requiring potentially 100x more ram). I have heard you don’t need to run all aspects of full node thus reducing ram usage, how much does that really reduce ram usage by? (1/2? 1/10?)

Here's my attempt to explain how Market Pegged Assets (such as bitUSD or bitGold) work.  Questions, comments, suggestions improvements welcome.  

-----

**Shorting 101**

First, in order to understand how Bitshares Market Pegged Assets work, it helps to understand how short selling stocks works. 

Short selling works as follows: you borrow a stock, sell the stock, and then buy the stock back to return it to the lender.

Short sellers make money by betting that the stock they sell will drop in price. If the stock drops after selling, the short seller buys it back at a lower price and returns it to the lender.

For example, if an investor thinks that Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) is overvalued at $300 per share, and is going to drop in price, he may borrow 10 shares of TSLA from his broker and sell it for the current market price of $300. 

If the stock goes down to $200, he could then buy the 10 shares back at this price, return the shares to his broker, and net a profit of $100.00 per share:  $300 (selling price) - $200 (buying price) 

However, if TSLA's price rises to $400, the investor would net a loss of $100 per share:  $300 (selling price) - $400 (buying price)

To ensure that they’re paid back for the stock they’ve lent to a short seller, brokerages require short sellers to put up sufficient collateral to buy back the stock.  To account for the possibility that the stock’s value could increase a large amount rapidly, brokerages typically require at least collateral worth at least 150% of current value of the stock.  (In the US, short sellers are required by law (Regulation T) to deposit at least 150% of the value of the shorted stock.)  

Short sellers must also keep the margin account topped up by a certain percentage (called the maintenance margin) so long as they’re shorting the stock.  Typically, brokerages require a maintenance margin of 130%.  If the short seller cannot meet the maintenance margin requirements, the brokerage forces the short seller to buy back the stock with their remaining collateral and return the stock to the brokerage. 

**Market Pegged Assets**   

Now let’s see how short selling is related to the creation of Market Pegged Assets.

Suppose that there exist two investors, one named Dwight and another named Creed.  

Suppose that Dwight is willing to give up some gains in exchange for lower volatility.   

Suppose that Creed believes that the the value of the dollar relative to BTS is going to decline.  Therefore, just like TSLA in the Shorting 101 example, Creed wants to short sell the dollar.  

**Collateral requirements**

Before he can short sell the dollar, Creed must ""borrow"" it first, just like a short seller borrows shares of Tesla from his brokerage.  

So the Bitshares network creates a token called bitUSD.  By definition, one bitUSD is equal to one dollar’s worth of BTS.

Creed can then “borrow” this bitUSD from the Bitshares network.  

However, just as with a shorted stock, Creed must first put up collateral sufficient to repay the Bitshares network for the bitUSD he borrows.   The Bitshares network currently requires 175% of the value of each bitAsset as the initial margin collateral.  

Let’s suppose that at the time Creed creates his bitUSD, the dollar is trading at exactly one BTS/dollar.  In order to avoid an immediate margin call, Creed puts up 2 BTS as collateral.  

The Bitshares network will then issue Creed one bitUSD, which Creed can then trade for other cryptocurrencies, fiat, or other goods and services.  For example, he might sell his bitUSD to Dwight at a slight premium of 1.05 BTS/bitUSD.

**Example #1:  bitUSD/BTS decreases**

Now suppose that after a few months,  Creed's prediction has proven correct:  the dollar has declined in value relative to BTS, and is now worth only 0.5 BTS/dollar. 

To get his collateral back, Creed need only spend 0.5 BTS, to buy one bitUSD and redeem it with the Bitshares network.    

Upon redeeming his bitUSD, the BitShares network destroys the bitUSD token, and releases the two BTS it held as collateral.  Creed now owns 2.55 BTS:  2 BTS (his original collateral) + 1.05 BTS (the amount he got for selling his bitUSD to Dwight) - 0.5 BTS  (the cost to buy back one bitUSD).  

In dollar terms, Dwights BTS are now worth $5.10, or $2.55/BTS:  $4 from the increase in value of his collateral (which increased in value from $2 to $4), $1 from shorting the dollar (0.50 * $2), and $0.10 from the slight premium he was able to make by selling his bitUSD to Dwight.  

Therefore, his return/BTS is 155%:  ($2.55 - $1.00)/$1.00*100  

**Example #2:  bitUSD/BTS increases**

Conversely,  let’s suppose Creed was wrong, and the value of the dollar increases relative to BTS.     

Suppose that the BTS/dollar drops such that Creed's collateral is now only worth $1.75.  The Bitshares network requires a maintenance margin of 175%, so Creed must add enough BTS to his margin account to exceed  175% of the value of the bitUSD he’s been issued.  In addition, to encourage bitAsset issuers to never let their margin get close to the maintenance margin threshold, the Bitshares network assesses a 5% fee if it is forced to execute a margin call. 

If Creed cannot meet his maintenance margin requirements, the Bitshares network uses his remaining margin to buy back enough bitUSD to liquidate his position.  Buying back bitUSD reduces the supply, which increases the price of the remaining bitUSD, thus keeping the value close to the peg. 

**Example #3: Black Swan Event**

In the rare event that the value of BTS falls by more than 75% in less than an hour—thereby resulting in insufficient collateral--100% of the remaining collateral would be used to buy back as much bitUSD as possible.  However, this would leave some bitUSD without any backing, which would likely uncouple the peg.

-Are the transaction fees smaller compared to Poloniex and Bittrex?

-Is it a viable alternative to Shapeshift.io and Changelly? Their fees are very high. Is it cheaper to do here?

-What are the disadvantages of using this site?

## Summary

In 180115 we release a new header on the Exchange, fixed a variety of issues associated with accounts prior to a user logging in, close the send modal after success, and made some small Deposit Modal tweaks

## New

The Exchange header now shows values more prominently and minimized the size of the labels. It also spans the entire width in an effort to reduce wrapping on narrow browsers. We have not addressed fully responsive design yet. This change is in preparation for the upcoming TradingView integration.

We separated the Accounts list from the Markets. These never really belonged together. While we expect some pushback on this, we hope to alleviate some concerns when we separate the account switcher menu from the navigation menu in the next release. Thanks for your patience on this.

The deposit modal was getting called from Portfolio even when certain exchanges had not yet been activated in the GUI. While we haven't actually added the new exchanges yet, we do plan to add BRIDGE and GDEX once we can communicate with and test their API.

This was a very short Sprint since the the most recent one ended on 1/8. Still shooting for Withdraw and TradingView by the 180201 release.

### Future plans include:

- Redesigned Withdrawal
- Tradingview integration
- Responsive Design
- Friendlier multisig interface

I haven't had a chance to read about these banks yet so i don't know anything about them.

Copying telegram announcement here:

Jared Rice Sr, [16.01.18 15:57]
A month ago, we set out to acquire two banks. An FDIC-insured bank and an investment bank, apart of a large portfolio of banks, owned and operated by a company who were gracious enough to want to do business with us and partake in a future that we had visioned together for an entire year.

Jared Rice Sr, [16.01.18 15:59]
Thanks to Eddy Taylor at BitShares and some of their team, we were introduced to Richard Smith, a great person, whom I have become great friends with over the course of the last month. Richard brokered the entire deal between us and the banking group. He even let us buy both banks with cryptocurrency. Just to sweeten the deal. Although cashing out of these cryptocurrencies has been slow, he will get them fully paid in due time. We are going to help speed that up as well in the coming days.

Jared Rice Sr, [16.01.18 15:59]
Two banks are being acquired in this deal:

Jared Rice Sr, [16.01.18 16:00]
KFMC Bank Holding Company (100 year-old commercial bank in the USA). We will have 100% equity ownership.

Jared Rice Sr, [16.01.18 16:00]
TPBG (A 25 year-old investment bank and investment management company). We will have 100% equity ownership of this as well.

Jared Rice Sr, [16.01.18 16:01]
We chose a small bank, because it wasn't the size of the bank that matter. It was truly the power of the bank and what that bank represented that stood out to us.

Jared Rice Sr, [16.01.18 16:01]
It was the first chance we had to merge the old guard with the new guard, using an investment tunnel with TPBG, that would truly bring a new vision to consumerizing cryptocurrencies for the masses.

Jared Rice Sr, [16.01.18 16:01]
I have had a habit of being pretty transparent, even when it pisses people off.

Jared Rice Sr, [16.01.18 16:02]
And others have had a pattern of being petty.

Jared Rice Sr, [16.01.18 16:02]
That's ok - because - today THEY CANNOT DENY THE REALITY OF ARISEBANK ANY LONGER.

Jared Rice Sr, [16.01.18 16:02]
So

Jared Rice Sr, [16.01.18 16:03]
Let me go ahead and drop these papers from the top of the mountain - so that everyone can spread the reality of what fake news represents in this country. Why we have to push out these sort of people and carry this torch to the people who have our best interest at heart. Let's begin the fight for our crypto rights.

I figured I would come here since the community here was part of the reason why I was interested in BTS and the OL concept. Anywho, I bought my BTS a while ago, and deposited to my account on Open ledger by the name of akarim1 - ok great, the interface was a little weird but not too bad once you get the hang of it. I downloaded the .bin file, the brainkey phrase, everything. And then I come back two days later to try and log in, and I was having some trouble, hm weird, but eventually after copy-pasting my password (Yes, I only Copy-paste it, i did the same thing when creating the account) and I still was having trouble, eventually I got in through the wallet model (using my back up file) and changed my password. I got on the next day where the new password wasn't working, but the private key password was. Huh, weird. I should've known something was up, but I figured it was all good, and I deposited some more BTS to my account. But now NONE of it is working, not the .bin file backup, not either of the two passwords. Nothing. I emailed customer support, and they curtly said ""if you are using the right password it should log you in"" and then proceeded to close the ticket on me. I replied to the follow up email about the ticket closing saying nobody helped me with my problem, and they ignore me again. 

Not sure if customer service is very overwhelmed, or if they are just genuinely a-holes who don't care. But I was not too happy. and worst part is I currently have all my BTS just stuck in this account and I have no way of getting back it. WhenI restore using the .bin file, it says it is successful (and recognizes my password) BUT then when I click the take me to dashboard link, it just simply takes me back to a blank login screen. 

Anybody got any tips or suggestions please? :(",NA,"7tabmo",NA,0,NA,"false",1518589940,"false","self","t5_2ykpf","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/BitShares/comments/7tabmo/openledger_io_bugged_my_password_and_customer/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

A primer by example.","**DISCLAIMER**: *The following is not investment advice. As always DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH and do not invest more than you can afford to lose. The information provided below is either publicly available or easily verifiable by anyone and the same path can be followed by whoever wishes to confirm my findings and decide for themselves. The same reasoning can be used and executed on any upcoming ICO in order to perform due diligence. The following are the author's findings and opinions only.*

A little while ago, I became aware of the ICO of a company called AriseBank (www.arisebank.com) through social media as well as mentions by fellow crypto investors in a few crypto-related group-chats I'm part of. Their concept and offering sounded very interesting and something that could revolutionize cryptocurrencies.

My interest peaked I decided to check them out for a potential investment.

At first glance, the website is very nicely done with a great design, tons of information, loads of fancy graphics, as well as all the expected elements of an ICO (terms, distribution, white papers, ways to contribute etc.)

Seeing as I am primarily a developer, my next stop was AriseBank's two code repositories at http://labs.arisebank.com/explore and http://github.com/arisebank .

## Now, this is where things got interesting.

Labs.arisebank.com appears to be a very hastily set up gitlab installation with a single user and just a default e-mail set up.

Both the repositories contain many projects but a closer look at them reveals that the majority of them have hardly any commits apart from the initial commit.

An even closer look reveals that a lot of them are simply copies of existing open source projects with simple cosmetic or title changes.

In fact, in the vast majority of instances, hardly anything has been changed apart from names and titles, however project names have been changed and licenses removed from the original projects.

Not only a very big FOSS dev no-no but also illegal.

Here's just a quick recent example here: https://github.com/AriseBank/arisejs

Which ofcourse is https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/ark-js

And as you can see, the copyright notice was purposely and illegaly removed here: https://github.com/AriseBank/arisejs/commit/a6439747def6c3c0f78b4e20c6ebfd0e3e49a963

I believe this behaviour has caused considerable friction between AriseBank and the Ark community.

In fear of this getting too long, I won't link more examples but you may also compare AriseBank's repos against

https://github.com/lord/slate
https://github.com/lxc/lxd
https://github.com/lxc/lxc
https://github.com/aarnaud/lxd-webui
https://github.com/ArkEcosystem

as well as others. Proof lies just a 'git diff' away.

There is some original code there but nothing that couldn't be knocked up by a half-decent developer in a couple of days.

There is also a bunch of API client code stubs with almost no implementation created automatically using swagger which take minutes to create but inflate the repo/project count significantly.

My curiosity now heightened I returned to the website. A quick viewing of the source reveals the site is set up on Wordpress using a cheap readily available wordpress template. The site itself is hosted on a plain digital ocean server. Those things in themselves are nothing bad as such but are unusual for a block-chain project.

Next stop, the actual content.

A simple google search revealed that the vast majority of the content has been simply copied and plagiarized from other sites more importantly in the legal terms.

This was already enough for me for the most part but giving them the benefit of a doubt I contacted Metropolitan Bank mentioned in the terms to confirm their involvement as a deal with an actual bank would greatly legitimize the venture. I still wouldn't invest because the handling of everything above had killed my faith in their ability to deliver. However that's a far cry from bad intentions so I wanted to check it out.

Metropolitan Bank informed me by email that they had no agreement in place with AriseBank and in fact their compliance team was already investigating the website provided.

At this time I had no knowledge of the supposed partnership with Marqeta as it is not mentioned in the website texts and I had avoided AriseBank's social media as I usually do in order to not be swayed by marketing or any possible FUD posted by others in response (prefer to do my own research).

At this point I was convinced this company was completely misrepresenting itself and figured this would all be exposed soon forgetting about it for a couple of days.

Turns out someone had taken the same steps as me as I found out in the Bitshares telegram group and had gone public with the same information that I got from Metropolitan Bank.

In fact he went further and exposed the lack of any official partnership with Marqeta.

As I found out, AriseBank had supposedly partnered with Marqeta on Oct. 4  announcing it on social media.

This was used by AriseBank to show that this is why Metropolitan Bank answered that there was no agreement since they had a new issuer and that the website was simply out of date.

Putting aside the fact that oversight or not, the ICO was still performed on a website that misrepresented the current state of things (which should be a no-no as it can be used against them) the fact is that almost all of the legal terms on arisebank's website were updated on Oct. 3rd as can be seen here: https://www.arisebank.com/sitemap-pages.xml (and saved here: https://web.archive.org/web/20180118002603/https://www.arisebank.com/sitemap-pages.xml &lt;- you'll have to View Frame Source for this)

Just one day before the partnership announcement on their FB page (https://www.facebook.com/arisebank/posts/357340811375082 since deleted, but an available screenshot is here: https://i.imgur.com/8gGUEKJ.png)

Apparently though the partnership with Marqeta was exposed to be a false claim as officially announced by marqeta here:
with the following statement:  https://twitter.com/Marqeta/status/952560216553406471

""We do not have any relationship with AriseBank. AriseBank has referenced Marqeta without our permission, and we have asked them to immediately remove this misleading information. In addition, we do not provide programs that permit the spending of cryptocurrency.""

At this point, AriseBank's CEO (one Mr. Jared Rice of TX - more on him later) attacked Marqeta claiming they backed out of the deal at the last minute and that they're lying.

As proof he mentions that Marqeta themselves had AriseBank's announcement tweet on their website, providing a screenshot as well as a link to an internet archive saved page confirming the above (see here: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DThDoCQVoAAAGHT.jpg:large). He also mentions as proof the fact that @Marqeta's twitter account follows theirs.

(In fact, what seems to be the case is that Marqeta's site was running an automated feed aggregator to collect and display all @Marqeta mentions on twitter while a look at their twitter account makes it immediately obvious that they automatically follow back pretty much all who follow them.)

In light of recent events the aggregator is now moderated.

However, this so-called ""proof"" seemed to convince AriseBank's supporters who attacked Marqeta in social media and gave AriseBank the opportunity to wiggle out of a very difficult situation once again.

Seeing a lot of senior BTS community members still involved and supporting AriseBank and AriseBank managing to circumvent the difficult questions raised by everything above (I personally really don't understand how) I decided to continue my research.

I decided to focus on the team section of the website. Looking at the individuals in question and running whatever background checks I could using google and social media I found that most of them were within the AriseBank team.

I did however come across one Shawn ""Dot"" Scott  which seemed to be the odd one out as saved at the time of writing here: https://web.archive.org/web/20180115153656/https://www.arisebank.com/team/shawn-dot-scott/ (original mention on arisebank's site was deleted)

I contacted mr. Scott through facebook who was very helpful to inform me that Jared M. Rice had in fact contacted him with regards to this so-called project but after doing his own research and consulting others had reached the conclusion it was not legit and has had no further contact or involvement and that the inclusion of him on their website was false and misleading.

In fact, Mr Scott went ahead to publish an official tweet to clear things up as seen here: https://twitter.com/askshawnxyz/status/952917344359206912

At which point (like marqeta) he was attacked by the AriseBank social media team as well as their supporters and by Mr Jared M. Rice at Arise's telegram group.

In fact, AriseBank's social media team appeared to not even have a clue this was a person that was supposed to be working for them or was actually mentioned on their website as evident here:

https://twitter.com/ACryptoWhale/status/952932718198886400

and here:

https://twitter.com/ACryptoWhale/status/952932994007912450

Mr. Rice and his supporters proceeded to do a character assassination of Mr. Scott (a very respected community member who runs a non-profit in TX to get kids interested in technology) on their telegram chat .

Only then did they update their website's team section to remove references to Mr. Scott.

They also removed references to one Lee Perkins as previously included here:

https://www.google.gr/search?q=https://www.arisebank.com/team/lee-perkins

Which appears to be (although this I haven't had a chance to confirm) one Hoa Lee Perkins, indicted for money laundering as seen here:

https://books.google.gr/books?id=TbRyLLHX92UC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=Hoa+lee+perkins&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pBbaOpsskK&amp;sig=k7wMKMmYSh4cxSxS-EqZxIXDjlo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj6jfrAutzYAhUR5aQKHcjsBYoQ6AEIWDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Hoa%20lee%20perkins&amp;f=false

DISCLAIMER: This has not been verified

Other references removed include one Veer Singh as previously included here:

https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.arisebank.com/team/veer-singh (&lt;=- Note Bio)

Which brings us to the next point. 

At no point was Dotoji ever listed as a Fortune 500 Fasted Growing company as you may easily check online.

In fact, Dotoji's website claims instead that Dotoji was listed as an Inc. 500  Fastest Growing Company as seen here: https://dotoji.com/dotoji-ceo-launches-life-story-new-book/

Obviously this is not true either (again...easily verified online)

At this point I believe it becomes apparent that something is seriously wrong here.

However, let us continue down the rabbit hole.

Browsing the arisebank.com website the company is mentioned by many different names including : ""AriseBank, Ltd"", ""AriseBank, Inc."", ""aBank"", ""Arise Foundation,
LLC"", ""AriseCoin Foundation"", or ""Dotoji, LLC""

In fact, none of these companies appear to be actual legal entities as Texas' Department of Banking mentions here: https://www.dob.texas.gov/public/uploads/files/news/press-releases/2018/01-05-18pr.pdf 

(The warning above was followed by an actual cease &amp; desist letter to AriseBank as confirmed by Mr. Rice himself. He responded by refusing to comply in what might be rousing in rhetoric terms but completely unprofessional fashion which once again raises some doubts. Both letters can be seen here: https://steemit.com/arisebank/@wallop/arise-governance-we-the-people-a-response-to-the-texas-banking-commissioner)

The only one that SEEMS to be a valid company is Dotoji.

Their website lists many offices around the Texas area. My research has shown that one appears to be a residential home while most of the others are in very cheap monthly-lease co-working spaces.

Dotoji does not seem to have completed much marketing work for anyone. Their website also mentions their sub-brands Weoji, Pressoji. Appoji and Cheetah Agency.

Once again this super-succesful digital agency relied on a cheapo readily available wordpress theme for their website.

Despite the broken links and general lack of information on any of them (surprising for an award winning digital marketing agency) I was able to find some information on weoji on their facebook page here: https://www.facebook.com/iweoji

In fact, at this link:

https://www.facebook.com/iweoji/posts/838262519639237

they claim to have completed a Project for Syfy's The expanse. Although I can't be certain, a related google search makes this a most likely false claim. However i have contacted SyFy and will update with their response.

Researching Pressoji,

we come across this facebook page https://www.facebook.com/Pressoji

It becomes clear that this FB page used to be known as ""Fruit Local"" (when FB still allowed you to change page names) which is another of Mr. Rice's earlier Ventures.

Researching Fruit Local yields no information on much work produced except for so-called clients Investalife, CloutHost and GoEasyCloud (see https://web.archive.org/web/20130306233216/fruitlocal.com/). 

In fact all of these companies are Mr. Rice and (his associate in AriseBank) Stanley Ford as can be seen here: 
https://www.corporationwiki.com/Texas/Dallas/jared-michael-rice/101287748.aspx
and here:
https://plus.google.com/106395557873074199232

Appoji appears to be an iphone unlocking service(??!?) which I believe is an illegal activity as seen here: 

https://twitter.com/icloudunlocknow?lang=en

and on this review here:

https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/appoji.com


Googling the names, another one of Mr. Rice and Mr. Ford's earlier ventures along with another AriseBank member Mr. Tony Caldevilla is Dynastack Inc (or Dynalayer Inc.) which is mentioned as a scam here: 

https://www.ripoffreport.com/reports/dynastack-inc/dallas-texas-75201/dynastack-inc-dba-dynalyer-inc-scam-artists-jared-rice-tony-caldevilla-michelle-nosek-1132983

Apparently this was already brought up and AriseBank's response was that ""if it was a scam then where are the lawsuits?""

Well...one of them is here: https://unicourt.com/case/tx-tr-zayo-group-llc-vs-dynalayer-inc-356340

And I don't have THAT much time to search for more.

By the way if the name Michelle Nosek in Dynastack rings a bell, you might wanna check who left the review for appoji in the link above.

Returning to the present, AriseBank and Mr. Rice attempting to continue to mislead have claimed for a while that they are in the process of acquiring an FDIC-insured bank and an investment bank. 

This is mentioned on an article here: https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cryptocurrency-bank-arisebank-to-acquire-fdic-insured_us_5a32bad1e4b00caf3d59eb28 linked from their website and ""confirmed"" many times by Mr. Jared Rice on AriseBank's telegram group.

In light of recent events, this has been used to claim that they no longer need Metropolitan Bank or Marqeta as they  will then be able to issue their own cards.

How exactly that firs with the anti-bank/anti-regulatory rhetoric in the letter to the Texas DoB above is anyone's guess at this point.

The deal was supposedly signed and completed last week and announcements would be made on Jan 16th.

According to the FDIC policy seen here: https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/5000-1300.html 

""the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1829) prohibits, without the prior written consent of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), a person convicted of any criminal offense involving dishonesty or breach of trust or money laundering (covered offenses), or who has agreed to enter into a pretrial diversion or similar program in connection with a prosecution for such offense, from becoming or continuing as an institution-affiliated party, owning or controlling, directly or indirectly an insured depository institution (insured institution), or otherwise participating, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of the affairs of the insured institution. In addition, the law forbids an insured institution from permitting such a person to engage in any conduct or to continue any relationship prohibited by section 19""

And due to all the facts mentioned above along with the fact that Mr. Rice is currently under 2 pending felony trials for theft and tampering with government records in attempt to defraud/harm as seen here:

https://apps.collincountytx.gov/JudicialRecords/Case/CaseDetail?caseid=1452875&amp;nodeid=202&amp;referrer=Search%7CSearch%7CMain%20Search%20Results%7CParty%7CCR%2CCV%2CFAM%2CPR%7C7%7C%7CRice%7CJared%7C15%7C1%7C1%7C1%7C1

and here:

https://apps.collincountytx.gov/JudicialRecords/Case/CaseDetail?caseid=1452875&amp;nodeid=202&amp;referrer=Search%7CSearch%7CMain%20Search%20Results%7CParty%7CCR%2CCV%2CFAM%2CPR%7C7%7C%7CRice%7CJared%7C15%7C1%7C1%7C1%7C1

as well as all the records of Mr. Rice's previous run-ins with the law (easily verifiable by searching the various counties' in TX court records), I very much doubt the FDIC would provide such written consent.

In fact, I contacted the FDIC with the information above and received the following reply:

--------------------------------------------------
""Thank you for your inquiry.  The acquisition of an FDIC insured institution requires approval of appropriate federal banking authorities.  We have no knowledge of what, if any, institution is of interest to this party, and have received no filing related to such acquisition. 

You should be aware that Section 19 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, (12 U.S.C. 1829), prohibits, without the prior written consent of the FDIC, a person convicted of any criminal offense involving dishonesty or breach of trust or money laundering, or who has agreed to enter into a pretrial diversion or similar program in connection with a prosecution for such offense, from becoming or continuing as an institution-affiliated party with respect to any insured depository institution (IDI), owning or controlling, directly or indirectly an IDI, or otherwise participating, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of the affairs of the IDI. 

Finally, on January 5, 2018, we are aware that the Texas Department of Banking issued a consumer alert concerning AriseBank (https://www.dob.texas.gov/public/uploads/files/news/press-releases/2018/01-05-18pr.pdf).""
----------------------------------------

So no relevant filing has been made with regards to obtaining the required consent OR with regards to notifying of any intent. Also I find it very unlikely that the FDIC would provide such written consent considering the letter AriseBank sent to the Texas DoB (note that FDIC directs me to that warning as well).


In fact I received that e-mail shortly before Mr. Rice announced the big acquisition on Telegram.

Turns out, the big acquisition that they have been working on for months on refers to PART OF a down payment of 1% through a broker with a total value of 100k USD made most likely with the ICO money (guessing by the dates of the payments mentioned).

In case you're wondering, that ""amazing"" announcement led to more than 100k USD worth of BTS contributions to the AriseBank ICO BTS wallet (one born every minute) which immediately makes it worth it.

Also in case any of you have 100k USD spare, you can do the same in a couple of days:
http://www.globalbx.com/businesses-for-sale/buy-bank-1.asp

Not only that, but apart from the down payment, no relevant paperwork has been filed to regulatory authorities or to the FDIC (as explained above).

In fact, none of the 2 banks being acquired are FDIC insured as can be checked here:

https://research.fdic.gov/bankfind/

The bank names are K F Matthew and Co (incorporated in 1992 and not 100 year old as claimed by Arisebank)
and The Private Bank Group which appears to be an investment bank based in Geneva as can be understood by the current owner's linkedin profile here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/kurt-f-matthew-jr-6741142/

And the documents here: https://www.pdf-archive.com/2015/09/07/the-private-bank-group-summary/

What's even more interesting is that this investment bank is actually blacklisted by the swiss financial authority as seen here: https://www.offshorealert.com/private-bank-group-regulatory-warning-switzerland.aspx and here: https://www.finma.ch/en/finma-public/warning-list/the-private-bank-group/

In fact, what we deduce from the above is that not only has AriseBank
NOT acquired a bank yet like they claim (only a very small downpayment and no further paperwork)
NOT acquired an FDIC insured bank (neither is)
NOT acquired a 100 year old bank (inc. 1992)
NOT spent 1m of Mr. Rice's money on the acquisition like he has claimed in Telegram (just 100k possibly of ICO money)

but instead, the down-payment refers to what seem to be at least one troubled bank.

In fact there is a wealth of other information out there just a google search away  with many other red flags that I don't include here (e.g. bitofglory) because today I'm only dealing in facts.

One I can mention because it's easily verifiable to anyone with eyes is http://docucoins.com 

This is one of Stanley Ford and AriseBank's ventures as can be proven by looking at the author's avatar and the whois record of the domain (here: https://registrydb.com/docucoins.com)  which is plagiarizing content from CoinTelegraph as well as ripping off design from HuffingtonPost.

In addition many of the claims made on the so-called Team's linked in pages and arisebank.com bios as well as public statements that SHOULD be verifiable such as Mr. Rice's claims that 
""I wrote over 700+ repositories for people to go through"" have absolutely no records supporting them.

To top it all off, AriseBank and Mr. Jared Rice make claims regarding their offering's success  marketing citing much interest and references online while most of these appear to be bought likes and retweets from fake accounts as well as link-building from fake blog entries.

Proof is just a google search away

The same goes for the contributions, claiming over 700m USD invested so far. In fact a look at their BTS cryptocurrency wallet which is the cryptocurrency community they have focused the most on shows contributions of approx 750000 BTS (currently worth around 300-350k USD) (at the time of writing. Only posting this after the market dropped)

At this point, I don't expect AriseBank to be around much longer.

Binance is requiring me to sign an NDA before entering discussions about listing siacoin. The other time we've had to sign an NDA to start talking about integrations, we were asked some things that made me pretty upset.
If Binance tries to strike an unfavorable or slimey deal, I likely won't be able to talk about it. I wanted to let the community know before I agreed to silence that if we end up in a disagreement with Binance, I likely won't be able to tell anyone why.
We looking into more decentralized exchanges to see if there's some way to get out of this backwards system. Exchanges hold a lot of power today, and they know it. Most teams are flush with cash, and exchanges have been taking advantage of this situation, meaning teams that don't have enormous amounts of ICO money can't keep up.

This gets you caught in a limbo where your funds are stuck. 

The solution to this would be to use the BlockTrade option when you deposit funds to your BTS wallet. BlockTrade automatically trades your deposit into BTS (I’m assuming at the market fees value) so then you don’t have to worry about trying to exchange into BTS. 

Another option would be to make two deposits, one deposit to the OpenLedger and then make another small one to BlockTrade so you have just enough BTS to pay for the fee. 

If you’re already stuck in limbo, I would be happy to send you a little BTS to pay for your fee so you can buy BTS. BitShares is growing rapidly lately so I’m willing to help anyone who wants to buy BTS but can’t because they don’t have any BTS to pay for the fee.

So far, BitSharesBOT is almost the same as the original one, except the makers use their price feeds, and a UIA deposit to pay for network fees.  

Please note, the BitSharesBOT creators treated **Block 22607165** as the Genesis block to reduce their database memory usage.

Anyway I claimed my BTS and have been looking up this project more. I really like the DEX and pegged currencies - very much needed in the space. 

One concern I have is about dPOS. Who are these 25 witnesses and what prevents an oligopoly forming? If I understand correctly (from my very limited reading so far), 1 BTS = 1 vote. Witnesses earn BTS for providing their server resources etc. Therefore wouldn’t Witnesses over time be able to amass more and more BTS and not simply re-vote themselves back into becoming Witnesses again and again? Eventually they’ll be able to accumulate more and more BTS no? What prevents an individual Witness from taking up say 4/25 of the Witness slots, then 8/25, then 10/25 etc? 

Again, I’ve only sone limited reading so apologies if this has already been answered many times. Thanks!

Naysayers can come on here and slam this post. That is not why I am writing. I am posting this to help other level headed investors like myself find the truth, through the slander and FUD.

Also I would recommend joining the AriseBank Telegram channel. They are extremely active and transparent about their progress and inviting anyone to come contribute to the conversation or just observe. I think they would understandably welcome skepticism if there is no blame or judgement involved. They are working hard to come above the attacks at the same time as preparing for their product launch and ICO. Listen to what they have to say and make up your own mind.

I have seen lots of queries for the same topic bit didnt find a proper and official solution.
i subscribed to the Openledger, transfered bitcoin to buy BTS but cannot do anything due to the transaction's fee... in BTS... 
i tried everything I could and even when the fee is converter in Open.BTC at the end, an error message is displayed asking for BTS fees... 
any Help will be Much Appreciated 

Bitshare user: abouadjou-59

PS Feedback: My issue has been solved by someone transferring me 1BTS in order to be able to pay the transaction fees.
When transferring BTC to buy BTS to the Open Ledger use the Blocktrades gateway. It will directly convert your BTC to BTS.
If the BTS exchange Owners want it to be successful and open to the large public, they should find a solution to this fee issue.

The support held and confirmed the 4th wave completion (corrective wave).

Because we had an extended 3rd wave, the text book says that the 5th wave will equal in length the first wave.

This gives us a target of 5100 which is also a past resistance.


Stop loss- a close below the channel support line

Reasons why Arise Bank is in all likelihood a fraud
-The team behind Arise has committed fraud previously.
-There are at least two court cases in the last three years against Jared Rice (fraud and theft).  It appears plea deals were struck.
-The Arise Bank website has been copy and pasted from other websites.
-The supposed bank processor they were using for Visa processing has denied any ties to Arise Bank.
-The bank and attorney mentioned in today's release appear to either not be FDIC insured or maybe even exist.  Google searches provide next to nothing.  No websites, no contacts.  
-The State of Texas Banking Department has issued an official warning regarding Arise Bank.


Perhaps an even bigger problem in my mind lies with the fact that BTS chose to enter into business with the team from Arise.  Stan Larimer being duped and not doing the most basic of due diligence before entering into what appears to be a multi-million dollar deal. Ten minutes of basic research would give you pause to enter into a deal with the group behind Arise Bank.  This leads me to wonder if BTS even had legal representation reviewing contracts and doing the most basic of due diligence (a google search) before entering this deal.  How could this be?

Other unprofessional and disconcerting things.
-In last weeks Steemit discussing major new partnerships Stan Larimer gives cryptic references and we are told to listen to a song by Arlo Guthrie.  From that song we are supposed to discern that BTS will change the world and fight the powers that be through there amazing new hub (the lynchpin of this hub is supposedly Arise). 

Even more troublesome-- When asked to respond about the accusations against Arise on a Steemit comment Stan responded with a cartoon about having ""instincts"".  Could you imagine any legitimate business responding this way.  It is either supreme arrogance or stupidity.  Perhaps the Kool-aid has been drunk and they are too far down the path with Arise to admit it is a bad deal.    Unfortunately we will have tremendous FUD and be grinding lower until this is resolved, preferably by denouncing and severing ties with Arise immediately.",NA,"7qxjic",NA,1,NA,"false",1518546439,"false","self","t5_2ykpf","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/BitShares/comments/7qxjic/why_stan/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

I think it's important that people don't get scared away due to factors that are completely UNRELATED to the Bitshares blockchain.


I personally think Arise is starting to shape up as a scam.  I have no concrete proof but with a number of factors including the fact the 2 ""banks"" that have been ""bought"" are no where to be found on google this is not passing the smell test.  So until Arise 100% proves itself to be on the level, I think it should be considered a dangerous investment in both financial and informational capital.


But I REPEAT this is UNRELATED to the chain.  As with all markets there will always be those looking to take advantage and it's important to catch and remove those problems like the cancer they are.  In fact, I'm encouraged that the BTS community has identified a potential issue and shone a light on it.  This may strengthen our resolve.

I'm quite appalled at the treatment of them by the community and others. I'm shocked at the current feeding frenzy that was, and is, being so carefully engineered during the single month that I was trying to get to know them. No doubt, Arise made many mistakes, but I don't believe they were a scam. That word has become like the word ""racist"". You always know that the true scammers and racists are those who indiscriminately apply those terms to others.

&gt;From my limited perspective, it appeared that they had the resources, ability, and intent to deliver on everything they described in the Vision they painted on their web site. Like the Wright Brothers, their plans were ambitious. Maybe unrealistically ambitious. But that was for their supporters to decide.

&gt;**Arise stakeholders were gravely and universally harmed by the authorities, not by Arise. Any harm by the Arise team remains a theoretical potential, permanently rendered unprovable at this point. It was a mere possibility, not even a probability. The probability of harm caused by the government, however, was 100%. Arise is dead.** With no chance to demonstrate whether they could or could not deliver. Now supporters will have to sit out from participating in the industry for years waiting to get their money back. The opportunity cost for them is staggering! If the government had quietly investigated, maybe even asking for a briefing on what Arise was doing, supporters from around the world would have remained fully liquid, able to ask for refunds or sell their positions in the open market. Now they can't. Is that the kind of ""protection"" we want?

## Background

There aren't many distilleries in the US that make great absinthe, but BRYCE DISTILLERY plans to open one of them, modeled after the Swiss.

BRYCE DISTILLERY is a startup absinthe distillery, born of fun and passion three years ago at a community apple-pressing in Missoula, Montana.

I’ve seen a lot of posts that AriseBank is a scam and they don’t have any actual products yet. But the same thing goes for Cardano, and no one is accusing them of scamming anyone. 

Did AriseBank just get a bad wrap from their CEO apparently being involved in a few scams? I feel like a scammer doesn’t put this much effort into something for it to be just a scam. 

But then at the same time I would rather just keep my money in BitShares where I know I won’t be scammed.

In 180108 we release a beta version of the deposit modal and removed the beta label from the send modal. We also fixed a problem that kept users from downloading their old .bin file from [https://bitshares.org/wallet](https://bitshares.org/wallet). We resolved a number of bugs as well.

## New

Known accounts are now displayed in a typeahead and are displayed in green if they are in your contacts. This should help minimize sending to unknown users.

We awarded the bounty for the UDF wrapper which sets the stage for Tradingview integration. Really hoping to have tradingview in place during the next sprint or two.

We moved the language selection to the account registration page to make it easier for new users to become oriented.

We refactored open orders. It's still a work in progress, but we hope to be getting closer to a meaningful UI here.

### Other Improvements

- Increased the precision of the collateral slider to 1% from 5%
- Improved the Help area styling
- Created some UX for responsive design
- Fixed numerous bugs

### Future plans include:

- Redesigned Withdrawal
- Tradingview integration
- Responsive Design
- Friendlier multisig interface

For a summary of bugs and features, check out the [Release Page](https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-ui/releases/tag/2.0.180108).

I'm hoping someone can give me some clarity on this subject. I'm really all new to this so I hope you can forgive me if I get it all wrong. Then again, any help on this subject would be wildly appreciated :)

Suppose this friend of mine bought some real-estate that is totally devastated by logging companies. Because of this he bought it for $1,- per square kilometer. The soil is not much good  and needs special treatment or it will take decades if not centuries of recovery time before anything significant can grow there again. But that's not all. Since the soil can become even more toxic over time, it effects the direct surroundings and leaves its traces downstream in a negative way. 

If he would produce an UIA token (called landtoken) for each square meter he owns and back it by collateral in the form of a smartcoin (called bitland) one could start regenerating the land with an initial investment released from the ICO of the landtoken and later generate a steady income for continues preservation of the area by interest and transaction fees on the bitland pool.

I'm confused however when it comes down to backing the landtoken by collateral in the form of a bitland asset. If I would sell each token for $1,- and then back it by 2 more to get a bitland, I end up $1000 short on my ICO per square kilometer. 

I also do not understand wether or not a bitasset must at all times by pegget to a life feed of something in the external world like the bitUSD and bitEUR do to name a few. I guess it does not, since the collateral in the form of USD or EUR gives stability to the asset; a token alone does not. In reality however the collateral is not given in USD, EUR or BTC, but in BTS. So a bitUSD is equal to two times the BTS marked value of $1,- and the thirth is pegged to the USD life feed. Therefor one bitUSD is backed by 200% collateral in BTS.

When I would release UIA token and sell them for $1,- how would I add collateral to it? Do I need a life feed of the exchange value of the token like other smartcoins do? If not and I would generate an asset like bitland, it would instead be backed by an effective 300% collateral.

All I want to do is to add stability to the token and create a derivative out of it that can be freely traded. The token itself can only be traded between its members.

However, there are some questions related to this matter that I would like to address with an example:

1.- So, right now, the price of BTS is 1 CNY and I think it will start going up from there so I'd use 5 BTS to create/borrow 1 bitCNY so the colateral has a ratio of 5. Could someone please explain what are the ""Feed Price"" and ""Your Call Price"". Why isn't the ""Feed Price"" the same as the current price (1 BTS = 1 CNY) and how is the ""Your Call Price"" calculated? Shouldn't it be the price I borrowed the bitCNY times 5 (my colateral ratio)??

2.- Lets say I have created/borrowed 1 bitCNY and I sell it into the market, so now another person that wants to have their savings on CNY has it, but the price of BTS keeps falling down to the point the colateral I used to create that bitCNY is barely enough to cover the price of 1 CNY. What happens then? Does that person gets my 5 BTS so he can sells them for 1 CNY or for a new bitCNY with more colateral? 

Thanks a lot in advance for your comments and help! I really hope someone could help me out to understand this thing better. Cheers.

We, Blockchain Projects BV (http://www.blockchainprojectsbv.com), are proud to announce the initiation of listing the BitShares core token BTS with the Lykke exchange (https://www.lykke.com).

Contact to the Lykke team was established November 2017 and we have been negotiating since then to get BTS listed. We are in the process of completing the technical work as we speak. The BitShares Blockchain Foundation (BBF) was involved between Blockchain Projects BV and Lykke to get the required legal confirmation to list BTS, which was necessary since Lykke provides a direct FIAT on- and off-ramp (https://steemit.com/bitshares/@bitshares.fdn/lykke-will-enable-on-off-ramping-bts-smartcoins-are-considered). The BBF will continue to provide technical and economical descriptions to Lykke’s legal council in the next goal to explore the possibility of listing BitShares price-stable SmartCoins (e.g. bitUSD, bitEUR, see http://www.bitshares.foundation/smartcoins).

We see great benefits for the BitShares community and want to summarize the impact of the Lykke integration:

 - A FIAT on/off ramp for BTS without the need for Bitcoin
 - A potential FIAT on/off ramp for the price-stable SmartCoins


Thanks to Lykke, the integration module that is being developed for the listing, called

 - Bexi - **B**itShares **Ex**change **I**ntegration API,

will be open source and made available after the development is completed, reviewed and tested by Blockchain Projects BV.

I'd like to be able to trade it into other bit commodities like bitBTC, but it doesn't give me the option.   How do I buy bitEOS or bitETH with bts? 

2nd question
When I withdraw BTS to BTC on an external wallet, do I get this right that it only charges a small BTS fee and that there is no BTC fee for the trade?  I must be missing something.  

3rd question
If Bitshares org owns a billion coins still, who becomes a billionaire if bts goes to 1 dollar?  Can't this group of owners also manipulate the price quite a bit, not unlike a fiat currency?  

Also bitsharestalk.org is down.  Thanks for any answers.

OK, it is just what I want.

The only thing i seem to understand is that BitUSDT is like fiat but, for example : if i go with bitUSD is it like i was taking a short margin ?

i have some 322 followers on tradingview.com that follow my update on BTS and i would like to have some knowledge to help this community to learn about how to use DEX and what you can really do with your BTS assets.

On an another subject, it seems that mining is made by vote attribution by witnesses. What i can do to be part of the potential miner pool. I mine other cryptocurrency but i want to put my hash power to the service of the BTS community.

Please be kind, thanks.

Within a month we will make the migration to new gateways for most coins (BTC, DOGE, ETH, LTC, DASH). New gateways are much more stable and faster than the old ones.

Due to all these updates, in nearest future old gateways for all these currencies will be closed. These changes will be unnoticeable and won’t affect on users that use official services (openledger.io, wallet.bitshares.org, gdex.io). Be careful using third-party services and Apps. Without third-party service updating after the shutdown of old gateways from OpenLedger side, the user can unconsciously make a transaction through old gateway.

Please, note: all funds are in safe and will be processed manually, but it will take much time for us to carry out your transactions from.

For your convenience, we recommend you to use OpenLedger official websites when you use OpenLedger transfer service for deposits and withdrawals. Using official websites you will always be aware of all the latest changes and get technical updates first. In turn, we will send all updates to Bitshares Upstream, but these changes may take some time to take effect.
Dear Desktop App users, please update your app to the latest version and stay tuned for further updates.

I became interested in decentralized exchanges not only because of security, but also because of low fees.

First I just studied bitshares and I really liked the idea and implementation. 
I already wanted to start trading, but noticed that I was horrified!

Where did these fee to buy assets come from? 0.1% That's a lot! 
Moreover, why the commission in percentage terms?

Of course, if you trade a couple of dollars, you are ok. 

Who invented this nonsense?

After I went to the openledger, I did not see the ""market fee"" option, but tried to buy a few dollars for the test, and know what? Openledger charged 0.1% to me, and by the way do not talk about it! 

If I install a full node, will it change something? Or it's programmed on blockchain ? 

I'm desperate, guys! 

Bad, baad idea ...

This is litterly the first time I am posting about it to see how people would react to such a system. Currently, it is able to find arbitrage opportunities between **Binance** **Bittrex** **Bitfinex** **HitBTC** **OKEx** **Poloniex** **Kraken** **HitBTC** **Huobi** **BitStamp** **GDAX** and **Bit-Z**.

It's not like the average arbitrage bots, mine works by not only calculating the profit from buying on one exchange and selling on the other, but also considers things like trading volume to filter out poor options, so you don't waste your time on an arbitrage opportunity that only works with 10$ before the prices begin to converge. If you've made it this far, know that BitShares is trading 20% higher on Binance than Poloniex right now.

My system is designed to eliminate trading risk by keeping your money out of the market for as long as possible. The purpose is to detect when there is a large price gap between exchanges and capitalize off it, which means you get in and out as fast as possible. The only risk is the time it takes to transfer from one exchange to another, but the ERC20 tokens transfer pretty fast, so it works well with most digital currencies.

I would like to see how many people were able to successfully profit from arbitrage, also who would be interested in such a system. Especially now that BitShares is so fast, it is really not as risky as other coins. Right now there are opportunities for 20% gains.

The app is called ""CryptArbitrage"" on the Google Play Store, I'm keeping it free and adless for you guys. --------TRY IT OUT-----------------

I'm planning to setup my own DEX using BitShares and this is my first day exploring it. It seems like the DEX is separated into the UI itself and a full node. 

It took me almost a day to set up the DEX completely and I've finally managed to get the node running and have had the DEX pointing at my own node. 

Just one question here.. what's the benefit of people like me running my own BitShares exchange? Will I be able to get a cut out of the transaction fees? I've been looking for articles for this but the closest I could find was on the network referral and haven't seemed to come across articles explaining on this. Any ideas?

One week ago I got send 10.000 badcoin to my mobile wallet, by a account named badcrypto.

Is this a free airdrop or some kind of scam? I can't find much information about it.

Also when I try to open the transfer data the wallet asks for my password. Out of precaution I did not enter it.

Is this something legit?

Tnx in advance for any information. ","","85vh1q",NA,0,NA,"false",1522331058,"false","self","t5_2ykpf","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/BitShares/comments/85vh1q/question_about_badcoin/","","",NA,"","",0,0

So basically, I got wrecked from the recent crypto crash. I had bought 1600 RISE coins from bittrex. Life got in the way and I JUST found out they got delisted. I transfer my remaining funds to the openledger in hopes of saving $100. However, when i try to sell for BTC i get an insufficient funds error in need for BTS. I try to buy BTS, but I get an insufficient funds error on that too....

I know this is a long shot, but If anyone can help me out my address is johnkim123

Deposited some btc in openledger.io, bought the token I wanted! Great, easy! 
Now go to put a few up to sell higher and wanted to withdraw the rest to personal wallet. No BTS, Insufficient funds.

Question 

1. do I have now have to buy BTS on poloniex or something similar to send to openledger? seems insane for a market to make you buy BTS somewhere else to use the dex

2.   In the help it says you  can switch your fee options, I cant find that anywhere.

3.   How did I buy the tokens with just BTC and no BTS the first time

This is all so confusing.

1. I installed BitShares 0.9.3.c, imported the wallet.dat file.
2. I exported the private keys using the command: wallet_export_keys, to a file named: keys.json.
3. I installed the latest BitShares wallet gui and went to settings-&gt; import and chose the option of importing from:
BitShares 0.9.3.c

But it says: “no account found” and doesn't import the keys.
looking at the json file it contains 1 account and a few addresses (both private encrypted keys and public keys)

From looking at the BITUSD price on Coinmarketcap it appears that the value of this ""stable coin"" seems to fluctuate between $.90 and $1.10.

Am I missing something here, or does the opportunity exist for me to purchase BITUSD when it gets down to the lower end of the range, and then sell it back when it hits the upper end of the range?

It appears like an easy opportunity for somebody to make 10% on these trades with something that is essentially ""stable"".

This sounds too good to be true, and usually nothing is ever this easy.

I was thinking about an absurd scenario:
Let's imagine today a nobody writes to the BTS community inviting...10 people from: BTS Investors, BTS Developers and from Openledger.io
Inviting them to enjoy a holiday in Italy (Liguria) in some sort of huge abandoned Villa in the hills but also very close to the Ocean...where they could discuss an idea which could:

1) Increase BTS value by 0%

2) Increase BTS value by 1000%

They could just visit Alassio, Sanremo, MonteCarlo, Nizza, Tuscany, Milan...and so on. Or go hiking in the hills. Or eat ice cream on the beach. Or go clubbing night...in a club or...you guessed it, on the beach. Or they could just all get drunk for no reason.

All these people would surely have no need at all for somebody to pay for their holiday whatever the outcome...

I will be brief.
Let's make this scenario real. This offer now stands.

One person is not invited... Dan Larimer (don't even know if he's still in BTS).
Why? 
I suggested watching a video on youtube about 2 months back. I wrote a public message on Telegram, and he thanked me ""for wasting 40 minutes of his life""...so I really do not want to make the same mistake again and won't waste even one single second of his life anymore. I apologize for that.

Please get in touch with me...or just ignore this post.

Thanks for your attention. ","false","8kcf8q",NA,0,NA,"false",1529739055,"false","self","t5_2ykpf","false","",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/BitShares/comments/8kcf8q/gamechanging_idea_for_bts_finally_here_1000_value/","t3_8kcf8q",NA,NA,"","",0,0

On OpenLedger, my first transaction, selling RISE for BTC, succeeded without any problems. But then, the troubles began...
&amp;nbsp;  
I wanted to buy some coin on OpenLedger, but I kept getting ""insufficient funds"". I googled it, I saw a few threads here on reddit, I saw other people having the same issues.  
&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Apparently, to make a transaction, you need to have a small amount of BTS on your OpenLedger account.** It is not possible to buy BTS with BTC, because... well, you need BTS for that.
&amp;nbsp;  
Seriously, it was frustrating and not user-friendly at all. 

&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  

Solution: Get BTS
========
- Here on reddit I saw threads were people donated/gave a small amount of BTS, so making new transactions was possible. You can do that; ask if someone can help you...  
&amp;nbsp;  
- Buy BTS on [BlockTrades.us](https://blocktrades.us/)!
    - I want low fees, so use DOGE to trade.
	- I bought 1500 DOGE on Bittrex; to make sure I can sell them back (Bittrex has a minimum transaction amount of 0.0005 BTC)
	- I bought BTS with DOGE on BlockTrades to OpenLedger BTS address (deposit on BlockTrades; withdraw from Bittrex)
	- I now have BTS on OpenLedger.
	- Buy DOGE with BTC on OpenLedger.
	- Buy DOGE with remaining BTS (make sure to have at least 0.15 BTS remaining on account.
	- Transfer all DOGE on OpenLedger back to Bittrex.
	- On Bittrex, you now can sell all the DOGE.
	
	
&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  

OpenLedger, never again...  
I am really happy with the way Bittrex works in comparison with OpenLedger.

These questions below came through in the main BitShares DEX Telegram channel a few minutes ago. I decided to take my time and provide an adequate response. I hope you like it and please let me know if I made any mistakes. I know I missed a lot, but these were the things that came to mind at the time.

**Question:** Can someone please explain why no one is talking about BitShares? Is there something I don't know? Seems to be by far the most impressive proven technology.

**Answer:** Because BitShares, being truly decentralized, doesn't have a dedicated marketing team to help promote this ecosystem. Also, the UI/UX design of the DEX/wallet is lacking in simplicity so newcomers get discouraged and leave. Last, but certainly not least, liquidity is still extremely low for most of the markets on the DEX.

Establishing a dedicated marketing team for BitShares is extremely difficult, but thankfully the way BitShares is designed, it allows for companies to build upon it and they can market themselves. Which indirectly promotes BitShares. Unfortuantely, this creates a catch 22 scenario. What comes first? BitShares marketing to create interest from 3rd party companies, or 3rd party companies finding BitShares and marketing for themselves?

UI/UX design issues are being resolved from different teams. Some are directly paid by the BitShares Reserve Fund/Pool while others build their own interfaces in hopes that it will generate income from referrals and gateway fees. Hopefully, we will have numerous, well designed, gateway/interface designs that will be user-friendly and well marketed.

Liquidity is being addressed by several iniatives. We have the DEXbot project which is building a native bot system that allows for staggered order trading on the DEX. There's the Auton.io market making trading app that is integrated to the BitShares DEX. Openledger.io is looking to launch a new fiat gateway. BitSpark will eventually be creating 180 different Market Pegged Assets which will be used to faciliate their remittance business around the world. All of these should help increase liquidity and allow for whales to play on the DEX.

In closing, you can see there's so much going on with the DEX, but it's not centralized. Information comes from many channels and sources, but it takes a community such as this to bring it all together. We may be spread around the world, but together we can make BitShares even better. All it takes is the willingness to do your part, whether big or small.

▬▬▬▬

Here's another question that just came through.

**Question:** So what’s exciting to look forward to in the near future? Are we gonna see .91cents again? Higher? What can be expected technology speaking?

**Answer:**

1. Crypviser just launched their unblockable, decentralized, permissionless messaging app on the Apple App Store. This is entirely built on the BitShares blockchain. This app will be updated in phases to offer additional features like built in crypto wallet and exchange. Additionally, at some point it will allow for unlimited text, data, audio, and video messages between individuals and groups. This tool has the power to revolutionize the way people communicate around the world without being at risk of man-in-the-middle attacks. Their personal information and interactions remain private.
2. The Quintric system is just wow. Think legal tender backed by gold/silver in crypto form. Here's a great article on that: [https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/so-how-does-quint-work-anyway-ff106415a108](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/so-how-does-quint-work-anyway-ff106415a108)
3. PalmPay is a PoS system that allows merchants to accept any digital currency at zero cost. Check out their site for more details. palmpay.io
4. BitSpark is poised to overthrow Western Union, MoneyGram, and any other old school money transfer system. All of this is done without the need for banks. Check out their site for more details. bitspark.io
5. I could go on, but I think you get the point. BitShares and any serious company building upon it are destined for greatness. Don't miss the boat.

&gt;Now Bitshares X asks this question: can a prediction market successfully exist with no settlement date and no delivery of the underlying asset?

&gt;&gt;**If the answer turns out to be ""yes"" - that will be a major breakthrough: it will mean Bitshares X can exist totally free from outside dependencies.**

&gt;&gt;**If the answer turns out to be ""no"" - then Bitshares X has a solid back-up plan: the use of an external feed to supply the btsx/USD rate into the blockchain. In this case Bitshares X will turn into a prediction market betting on the future price of its own shares (with bets being between Alice and Bob).**

&gt;Whatever the answer is the main purpose of Bitshares X will still be achieved: bitUSD is created and once we have that you'll be able to pay for your coffee in dollars with your phone but without any third-party intermediary.

Now that 3 years have passed, which one is it? It seems to me that Bitshares is now just using external data feeds to set prices, rather than using an internal consensus mechanism for pricing.  

Bitshares wound up using the back up plan. Is that correct?

I just created a BitShares account for the first time because I think it's probably one of the better DEX's available.

But the onboarding process is still what I think is keeping volumes low.

First question, in the app for OSX I see:

[https://faucet.bitshares.eu/onboarding](https://faucet.bitshares.eu/onboarding)

What's this for? I am aware of lifetime membership, but do I need any kind of membership to begin trading?

The link is broken anyway :/

Secondly: I paid in some BTC as BTS via open ledger. So my account shows a balance of 5,166.61 BTS

But I can't find where to nominate BTS as my fee payment currency. Instead all fee text fields show ""Insufficient Funds""

I'd love to see the barrier for entry to a platform like this lowered, the more people, the more liquidity :)

That means the private company claiming to have 100% reserves in a bank doesn’t have to meaningfully prove it to anyone. They only have to keep enough reserves to cover withdrawals on any given day.

You’re on my [analytic project](https://coinsocialstory.com/#utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=bitshares%20checking) I’ve been working on in my spare time for the last few months.

Here I make ratings of crypto-currency by different criteria, such as price, social, development and network(which is coming soon).

You can check all of your dynamics on your [personal page](https://coinsocialstory.com/bitshares#utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=bitshares%20personal)!��

And, for if I want to put the history of each coin in it, here I might need your help

If you can tell me something about the Bitshares history, I would very appreciate that.

You can write me here or on my email address [coinsocialstory@gmail.com](mailto:coinsocialstory@gmail.com).

And also I really want to hear some feedback from you about the project itself because there is still a lot of work to do :)

Your opinion is always welcome and I can’t wait to see any advice and suggestions!⚡️",NA,"8sb5xo",NA,0,NA,"false",1536404794,"false","self","t5_2ykpf","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/BitShares/comments/8sb5xo/community_feedback_is_needed/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

what is the deal with this stuff, can someone explain how its meant to work and best way to use it?

also i have a large ammount of BitShares on binance, but never seem to get any APPLECOM or any of that on there, am i losing out by having it on binance instead of C-B or does it send me an equivalent ammount of BTS or something instead?

Is this a function that was considered but never implemented? or is there a major issue with it i'm not seeing specific to the bit shares network and not polo. Also on the same note it also occurred to me that leveraging could be done in a similar fashion with the margin loan coming not from the network but other users the margin call would execute in a similar fashion only with leveraging your collateral is the asset your buying and with low volume markets this could be manipulated however this could be avoided by limiting the markets the user can use with the margin buy, requiring higher maintenance for the margin buy, and using the leveraged buy with collateral to reduce the risk of a call as the obvious risks to this would be that somebody could see the margin buy go up and sell to make the price go down and call the order with the low volume we have that wouldn't be too difficult. Also on the note of volume support for fiat is a major upside to any crypto exchange and with the fiat gateways down I think a new solution is necessary what that would be i have no idea but I understand with new regulation this can be more difficult. This is something I haven't seen elsewhere likely because of an incredibly volatile market with too many people buying on margin is never a good idea but seeing as how I haven't seen any exchange support this feature is strange.

""FIAT gateway was closed long time ago and still is closed. You can't make FIAT deposit or withdrawal via Openledger transfer service. ""

Shouldn't the BitShares app reflect that? Right now I still see a big withdraw button, this is a bit misleading, gives the impression you can withdraw when in practice it seems you can't do that anymore.

I'm a big fan of bitshares. using most of the different gateways running on it.

What I see has a big hurdle to mainstream adoption in Cryptos is hardware wallet integration.

The whole procedure of Saving and keeping the secret key secure isn't ideal for everyone. 

Switcheo got ledger integration. 
Binance is launching their dex soon.
Bitshares needs to think about this.

I'm new to bitshares agnd have found out now that one should always keep some BTS to pay the fees.

I've searched for a way to change the currency for the fees, but I dont get it.

I also searched for an open discussion where I can beg for a little BTS for one trade, but with no success.

Would anyone be so kind to send me some BTS for one trade? I'll send it back to you as soon as possible.

Only 40 BTC is now supplied on their DEX, but their daily volume is more than 220+ BTC.

It's insane. How do they generate 220+ volume from only 40 BTC supply!?

CryptoBridge generates 300 BTC volume from 1240 BTC supply, OpenLedger generates 40 BTC volume from 690 BTC supply and GDEX generates 40 BTC volume from 310 BTC supply.

&amp;#x200B;

See their largest market: LGS/BTC

You can see the funds just turn around among a few accounts: lgs-btc, dash-hash, qwerty127890, charlie19

&amp;#x200B;

Also their second largest market: BTC/USDT

Only two accounts are trading here: cryptomaster21, cryptomaster22

You can see the same strange things on the other markets, too.

There is a possibility the coin devs are doing this in the case of newborn coin market, but in the USDT and ETH market, no one except for exchange themselves has the motive for these self-trading.

They are definitely generating ""FAKE"" volume!!

I'll report this to CMC. They are listed on CMC as rank 113 exchange currently.
