I have some steps I went through to rule out that it wasn't a hardware issue. 

There are 6 GPUs (1070).
O- denotes the GPU is working
X- denotes it is not working/unplugged

I started with
OXOXXO

Swapping PCI connection from 1 to 2
OXOXXO

Swapping riser to GPU connection 1 &amp; 2
XOOXXO

Dissconecting working GPU and plugging non working GPU (1) into slot 2 on mobo
OXOXXO

Swapping 2 with 6 And disconnecting 6
OXOXXX

Swapping riser to GPU connection between 2 and 6. Leaving 6 disconnected
OOOXXX

if you guys have any idea what's going on it'd be much appreciated. I have Win 10, 4g encoding enabled, and I have three options for link speed, all turned to 2 gen. Mobo is ASUS prime h270 plus. Two EVGA 850 G2 PSUs. I have been able to get a 4th GPU present I device manager, but it had an error code 43. I also got it to work at one point but had an error code that required a restart which ended up turning it into an error code 43 after the restart. It also worked at one point, didn't show in the miner, then got error 43 and drug another GPU into error code 43 along with it, so I had two working GPUs and two with errors.

* Zero Previous mining experience
* Quite the experience in overclocking, undervolting, hardware mods, operating systems, etc.
* *""Fuck, why didn't I notice this mining trend a year ago?""*

Tell me how I hold up. Not intending on becoming yet another deluded noob; intending on having fun (is that realistic?)

* Gonna get a watt-meter first
* Gonna sell my other hardware junk to make room for some mining fun
* Gonna get a couple GTX 1050s, 1050Tis, 1060s, followed by optimizing the hell out of them (low TDP, high performance)
* Calculations do add up. With my current old lemon of a Radeon 7850, I'm making 0.8$ in flypool a day... which I estimate to be a bit less than local electricity costs, lol. With those Pascal GPUs, I'm gonna be in the plus. Significantly so. However, what happens two, three, four months ahead, that is a question...
* Not intending on making my hardware pay for itself; I mean, if I manage to pay off 50%, that'd be terrific; 33% would be doable, too (can always sell the cards...)
* Weasel approach: visit the lab or the workplace on late evenings and run mining scripts on those beefy PCs overnight (yay, free hashes!)
* Hypothetically... I might be okay till, say, March 2018 (AFAIK, Vega is expected to be shit Zcash miner, and Volta will arrive no sooner than in half a year from now)
* Bonus: Free heating through winter
* Bonus2: Cool hobby to smack-talk about
* Bonus3: Learn a bit about currencies, experience what it feels like being a wall-street psychopath a bit, see some bubbles burst, etc.

My worries involve:

* Not really having grasped that wallet stuff yet (I mean, there is one on flypool, and then, there's my wallet - and apparently, I can back it up, too; but also, zcash4win created, like, 5GBs of unsolicited garbage files on my PC)
* Not really having grasped this difficulty increase thing (how does that even translate to my potential mining profits? -- is it linear or exponential, can it be predicted and avoided to some extent?)
* Worried about potentially picking shit cards (e.g. gtx1050 non-ti 2GB) that may be useless once Zcash mining profitability is over the hill

Obviously, I haven't blown any money on any GPUs, yet (so if there is a potential fool in me, you pity that fool, and oh, do tell him). I do have nine potentially free PCI-E slots, though.

I've been watching the stats for a few days and I've noticed as I leave my machines mining there, when a block is nearing completion the pools hashrate goes up, it could even double, after the block is found, the hashrate goes down. This lowers my block reward and I get less overall. 

This allows you to game the pool, have a script running that switches your mining pool to flypool and when slushpool is nearing completion switch to slushpool and get the rewards, then go back to flypool to mine. 

The pool is running pretty low hashrate so the blocks can take 10hours +

6 - gtx 1070

I’m getting some issues when I install my 5th card. When 4 are seated I get solid 500 hash across the board for each 1070 on Zcash. But when I add a 5th one GPU 0 sits at 480, then 1st is 430, then 2nd is 240, then 175, then 134. I also can’t touch one of the cards in afterburner when 5 are in. After a while one of the cards fails and then I get an error code 43 in device manager. I restarted my PC and received a BSOD with an error code Nvlddmkm.sys. It restarted itself a few times then I got back in and checked device manager and now the 5th card has an error code 43. EWBF miner is also crashing after 2 minutes with error “device 0 thread exited with code: 4” with the screen freezing.

Anybody know whats up? Any help would be amazing! I'm going crazy with all these errors.

I've been looking into automation of the Batch scripts i use to start and stop mining on some desktops i use.

I've seen some other posts about people that made something really interesting where the miner would start via a task/service in windows and then allocate more CPU if the machine is idel or reduce if the user starts using it.

Ill update my post when i find the other post.
(update): link https://www.reddit.com/r/zec/comments/5av0x6/automated_zcash_mining/

it sounded grate but unfortunately the links were old and i haven't been able to get what was already build.
so now I'm trying to do it my self with out any real knowledge on building tasks or services.

So if anyone here knows the type of service/task I'm talking about and can share ? awesome!!!! much love :)

if not, Then i hope some of you are up for making it.

It would be really handy when you have access to multiple pc's that spend a lot of time just in idel mode.

Before you go all ""Arrhhhh CPU mining"" - 1. they are fairly powerfull cpu's and 2 the current payout for me is roughly 30-35$ a month extra. 
not a HUGE amount but still worth it.

Stay cool!

And when I say rig, I mean, not exactly. It is my former gaming PC (...and since I don't game as much anymore, might as well make myself some moneys instead...)

**The question: is the Rig set up well, temperature-wise? No fire hazards? No potential for sudden hardware failures? Etc.**

All the key information is in the images. Click 'em to see 'em.

**[The former state](https://imgur.com/a/sywHf)** (just a proof-of-concept to get my rig running): the case is lying in the corner of the room, on a carpet. Dust is settled in, PSU wiring is not optimized. At 30C ambient temperature and 53% GPU fan speed, I'm running the intentionally underclocked cards at as much as 74C (for me, anything above 70C is simply unacceptable!)
(that evil-est fan is there as proof of concept that more efficient cooling can be had)

**[The current state](https://imgur.com/a/ZtAHo)**: added two decent fans, placed the case onto a table. At 30C ambient temperature and 43% GPU fan speed (lowered in order for them not to annoy me), 69C at worst. When the temperatures get more favorable (18C), so get the cards (64C at most with 43% fan speed; 60C with 50% fan speed).
Also, might add that one extra fan (the pink placeholder); placing fans into other places does nothing (tried that, even with the noisy fucker of a fan).

However, is this acceptable? I'm kind of worried... you know, about VRM cooling, about the 200mm fan blowing the hot GPU air onto the motherboard, and stuff (I think I'm doing okay... but better safe than sorry... despite potentially looking like a little idiot for asking).

This one experienced miner dude I'm talking to told me to put the cards outside, onto a riser (his sad noob story is of him blowing up one of the cards, along with the PSU). I, however, think I should be fine (the cards seem cool; the area below the PSU is merely midly warm (~40C), etc.)

Tell me, is this rig built to last? See, I'd hate the motherboard to go in 3 months, etc.

-------☆ Welcome to ZCRASH.IO ☆-------

Every round offers a bonus, meaning better odds and more winnings!

Where? 
https://zcrash.io

What?
Provably Fair Crash Style (bustabit) game played with Zcash

Why?
Private Transactions -- Enhanced privacy of zcash via shielded deposits and withdraws (shielded ""Z"" addresses are optional)


Faster Confirmations -- Considerably faster deposits and withdraws than BTC


Lower TX fees -- Less coin spent on tx fees, more to play with


YABC -- (Yet Another Busta Clone?!) -- Yes! In addition to the reasons above, we believe that the 'crash' style game will be a classic internet game in the future. In the same way that most casinos have Blackjack. At the same time, we believe that there are a number of great bonus options and features to be explored.
FAQ
Answers to most questions can be found here: https://www.zcrash.io/faq


Do you accept investments in the bankroll? -- At this time we are not accepting contributions to the bankroll in an automated fashion. Mostly this is because we don't have the accounting measures in place to appropriately track this and it would quickly become a logistical nightmare. A system using smart contracts is being looked into. If you're interested in investing in the site please initiate a conversation with us via our contact form at: https://www.zcrash.io/support


What's the max bet? -- Right now the max bet is capped at 100K Zooks form manual bets and 1 ZEC for scripts but that will likely change soon. (A Zook is the zcash equivalent unit of bitcoin bits. So, 1 ZEC = 1,000,000 Zooks)


Do you have an affiliate program? -- Nothing official at this point but if you're interested reach out to us https://www.zcrash.io/support and we can talk.
* For our seeding event we followed the same steps as Bustabit but took it a step further and embedded the hash of our seeding message into the zcash blockchain before our clientseed hash was mined. More info on that can be found here: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/zec/comments/6igy0r/provably_fair_seeding_event_for_zcrashio/

Anyone else buying zcash or are we just mining?

I've moved over to Zcash mining with EWBF on Flypool. 
I'm not quite reaching the expected return listed on Whattomine.

My daily return per card should be about $2.30 yet I probably average out over 10% less at $1.95 - maybe slightly over $2 if I'm lucky.
How much are you guys able to get out of your 1070's?

And any advice on how I could get my max return would be great.

I have a question regarding power consumption.

I have two systems:

1. GTX 1060 6GB 
i5 4600k, 16GB, PSU 550 W (bronze, from 2007). 
Mining at stock ca 300 Sol/s.
Power consumption 175-185W

2. GTX 970 4GB, i5 6600k, 16 GB, PSU 650W (gold, from 2016)
Mining at OC ca 280 Sol/s.
Power consumption 55W (!!!)

Both systems has W10, SSD and I am using the same cuda zcash miner on flypool.

To measure consumption I used the same measuring device. I tested it on a 30W lamp and it shows 30W.

Could please someone explain me how it is possible. I saw a lot of tests on gaming sites and 970 shows like 130W consumption under load. So the wattage of two systems should be almost the same, I suppose.
Does it depend so much on PSU or CPU? Other factors?

Thank you.

 I'm noticing that there is a fee for everything when mining. First I have fees if I covert to BTC (from ZEC/ETH/XMR or whatever). Then, I need to get that BTC to the only place US citizens can liquidate to fiat. Seems ShapePhift works flawlessly in Jaxx but their fees (while on spot for the most part) will convert to other currencies but I had hell trying to get to BTC. We all have probably cashed out at one point or another so what do you think?

P.S. I'm trying to convert ZEC/ETC via Changelly or whaterver service so that I can use my Coinbase account for liquidation. I'm thinking fees may be lower if I use nicehash to by BTC wallet and their Visa card for fire sale scenarios like today.

* I've tried Catalyst 15.7.1 and 15.12

I'm mining ethereum just fine so I'm pretty sure its not a heat issue as ZEC is less intensive I believe.



I've tried mining with Nicehash Miner, Claymore's Zcash Miner (which happens to be the most profitable mining program to use on nicehash, so they both crash for the same exact reason) and Optiminer, which gives me the least of my problems.


**Optiminer Zcash**: Most Stable, only one that doesn't crash with the default script. Unfortunately though, I seem to only be getting about 75-80% (230 S/s per GPU) of the S/s I get on nicehash or Zcash miner.

*Optiminer Zcash Script*:

SET GPU_FORCE_64BIT_PTR=1

optiminer -s zstratum+tls://us1-zcash.flypool.org:3443 -u t1at699JyMWwpptiKZCLJjHRtYasAskN5wF.B1M1 -p X -m 8080

pause


**Claymore's Zcash AMD Miner (12.6)**: Gives me my expected hashrate (290 S/s per GPU) but always say's: ""GPU(X) has returned an incorrect value"" or something along those lines.

Fiddling with the intensity makes it to where the original trouble card is fine, but then another gpu starts returning incorrect values.

*Claymore's Zcash AMD Mining (12.6) script*:

* GPU_FORCE_64BIT_PTR 0
* GPU_MAX_HEAP_SIZE 100
* GPU_USE_SYNC_OBJECTS 1
* GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT 100
* GPU_SINGLE_ALLOC_PERCENT 100
* ZecMiner64.exe -i 2,6,6,4 -zpool us1-zcash.flypool.org:3333 -zwal t1at699JyMWwpptiKZCLJjHRtYasAskN5wF.B1M1 -zpsw x


**Nicehash Miner**: Same issues as the Zcash Miner, It doesn't give me an option to turn the Claymore Zcash algo off, also from what I can tell no way to alter the script internally? If anyone knows how to please tell meh!


Pls if anyone has a similar machine or video cards and has a working script that is different than mine, I would really super appreciate ittt.

You can find some other anecdotes if you search around Reddit -- for example, [this poor bastard](https://www.reddit.com/r/shapeshiftio/comments/6xiwcu/thank_you_shapeshift/dmjo8lp/) waited more than 3 weeks for his ZEC. Here's my recent unpleasant experience going from BTC to ZEC.

**Summary:** More than 2 weeks after my BTC send to ShapeShift was confirmed in a block, after opening a support ticket and sending them a number of messages, I did eventually receive ZEC in a t-addr.

**Details:**

ShapeShift [claims](https://info.shapeshift.io/about):
&gt; Let's assume you have Bitcoin and you want Ether. [...] In a few moments, your Ether will be quickly sent to you.

That may be true for Ethereum, but it's definitely not true for Zcash.

ShapeShift's interface is slick enough. You pick a cyptocurrency to send and a cryptocurrency to receive, then enter:

* an amount of the 1st cryptocurrency to send
* an address to receive at
* a refund address for the original cryptocurrency, if there's an issue on their side

Then they give you an address you can send your original cryptocurrency to. When you transmit the send from your wallet, ShapeShift detects the transaction and their status page updates from ""Awaiting Deposit"" to ""Pending Confirmations"". The next step is waiting for the transaction to be confirmed in a couple of blocks. After that, ShapeShift supposedly sends you your new cryptocurrency.

In my case, I sent them BTC and requested that they convert it to ZEC and send it to a z-addr. ShapeShift's status page read ""Pending Confirmations"". But a few hours later, after the BTC send had been confirmed in several blocks, ShapeShift's status page had gone back to ""Awaiting Deposit"", and read ""Time Remaining NaN:NaN"". Not promising.

Eventually submitted a support ticket. After over a week of no progress, gave them a t-addr to use instead of the z-addr I originally requested. Close to a week later, finally received ZEC at the t-addr. The amount of ZEC they sent appears to be based on the ZEC/BTC price ratio at the time my original send was first confirmed in the blockchain.

**Conclusions:** ShapeShift.io purports to allow users to easily convert between cryptocurrencies. For this to work smoothly, they would have to handle the transactions w/ software, not w/ employees frantically entering data into wallet programs for 54 different cryptocurrencies like [Lucy in the chocolate factory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkQ58I53mjk&amp;t=62). Apparently, their software doesn't work w/ Zcash. It could work w/ t-addrs and not w/ z-addrs, but then why not do 5 minutes of work and have their transaction form warn the users when they enter z-addrs?

I'm not sure what settings to throw in the config or even in Afterburner so I'm not burning out, but not getting a constant GPU shutdown due to heat either.

So, something stable and not too over the top could help. I've seen other 1080 Ti mentions but I'm not too sure on what settings for one 1080 Ti card would end up doing to another and these are some expensive pieces of hardware so I'd like to get my ROI first before I burn them.

I've been wanted to ask this for a while. It seems strange, coming from a XMR background, the fact that privacy is optional in Zcash.

Suppose I received 50 ZEC in a normal transaction and want to pass that money to my dealer privately. If I sent to his z-address nobody can see the sender, the amount nor the recepient, but what happens to my balance on the blockchain explorer?

Essentially, people will be able to tell that I've made a secret transaction because my balance will be different than money entering - money exiting? This seems like a step back... Am I missing something?

I looked for information regarding how the data is encrypted on the zcash blockchain, but found no exact details on the algorithm used. I assume it is some commonly used public/private key algorithm, which would make it quantum vulnerable. Is this the case?  


The reason I'm concerned is that the blockchain is forever. It is easy to wave away concerns over quantum computers, as actually useful quantum computers may be decades away. It is easy to just say ""we'll change the algorithm to a quantum secure one by then"" and be done with it. And for concerns such as an adversary spending other peoples' coins or minting fraudulent coins, this is a valid response. We don't have to worry about that happening until someone actually *builds* a quantum computer.  


But post-quantum deanonymization is something we have to worry about now. It would be possible for a government agency to store the blockchain until they develop a quantum computer, and then retroactively deanonymize everyone who has ever used Zcash (if Zcash's anonymity is quantum vulnerable), as they have all the records of every transaction already stored, just waiting for the technology to come along to process it. Even if Zcash updates to use post quantum crypto at some point in the future, all transactions made before that point will be vulnerable for all eternity.  


Is Zcash's anonymity quantum vulnerable? I'm not as worried about Zcash itself being quantum safe (as the possibility of a quantum computer equipped attacker minting new Zcash *is* something we don't have to worry about until a quantum computer is actually developed that can factor keypairs), just the anonymity aspect of the information stored on the Zcash blockchain.",NA,"70zp6j",NA,0,NA,"false",1507573396,"false","self","t5_3g2bq","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/zec/comments/70zp6j/is_zcash_quantum_vulnerable/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

I've been mining on Slushpool for two weeks on and off. I noticed there was some irregularity with payouts but they always seemed larger than Flypool. Today, as I was actually watching the miner and pool dashboard, I noticed that the payout was taking an unusually longer amount of time. I viewed the CDF after noticing that the pool hash rate had gone from it's typical 2Mh to 4Mh in just a few hours. I also noticed that the round was about to complete. 

https://imgur.com/0aWbOpJ

The other interesting thing I noticed was that the increase was coming from only 100 or so workers and that the EU pool was way out of proportion. It also happens that the EWBF miner essentially stopped mining, right at the time of payout. Notice in the next image where this mining worker stopped, giving me speculation that someone is playing the numbers here. Is anyone noticing the same thing or anything similar?

Yesterday I was in a bar with a good friend who also mines Zcash since its launch like me.

So we had pizza and Beer and I was out of cash and the Debit Card Device had some technical issues.
So he paid for me and I said I will bring him his money the next day..
So we were talking about crypto and I thought, Hey crypto is way faster and he agreed to send him 0.1 Zec for 1 Salami pizza and 2 Beer  :D

Lets see how much this is worth the next years.

Either close to zero or 5k :D 

Lets hope 5k for everybody here :)

I just built a new rig with 2x evga 1080 ti and 2x zotac 1080 ti mini. 2 of the cards are running a little warmer than I'd like, between 70 and 72 degrees c. No matter what the configuration is on the mother board and the 2 psu's (2x evga 850w g2), 2 cards are still hot. The other 2 cards temps are in the 50's. When i hook up just 2 cards or 3 cards to the mobo temps will run in the 50's and then when I add the 4th, 2 cards will run hot. I was thinking it might be a psu issue but 2 cards running on 1x 850w psu plus the mobo my temps are in the 50's. So the other 2 cards running on the second psu should be ok too, right? Then I was thinking that it might be the dual power supply adapter causing a bottleneck. I dunno. Btw, I have to have my fans at 100% with power underclocked to 88% and temps on those 2 cards are still in the 70's. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

In the mean time I'd love to find out how the fees compare to bitcoin. What's the trade's-per-day rate at vs fees? With that I can compare it directly to bitcoin to try to forecast what the fees will be like at bitcoin's current scale.

**Edit**: I found this site: https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/zcash-transactionfees.html

If bitcoin is trading at 250k transactions per day, and zcash has 4k, then applying that ratio to the current zcash average fees scales up to 3 cents. That seems amazing but it also doesn't take into account the supply and demand of having full blocks on bitcoin. 

Anyway, prospects look good so far! As zcash gets more popular it'll be more clear what kind of fees we'll be looking at.

1. Is it based on the pool mining on my rig 1% of the time?

2. If so, does that mean it doesn't count or show on my accepted shares / balance?

3. Is the pool fee or any fee deducted from my payouts? 

4. Is a pool fee deducted with every payout?

Where? 

zcrash.io



What?

Provably Fair Crash Style (bustabit) game played with Zcash



Why?

Private Transactions -- Enhanced privacy of zcash via shielded deposits and withdraws (shielded ""Z"" addresses are optional)

Faster Confirmations -- Considerably faster deposits and withdraws than BTC

Lower TX fees -- Less coin spent on tx fees, more to play with

YABC -- (Yet Another Busta Clone?!) -- Yes! In addition to the reasons above, we believe that the 'crash' style game will be a classic internet game in the future. In the same way that most casinos have Blackjack. At the same time, we believe that there are a number of great bonus options and features to be explored.



FAQ

Answers to most questions can be found here: www.zcrash.io/faq

Do you accept investments in the bankroll? -- At this time we are not accepting contributions to the bankroll in an automated fashion. Mostly this is because we don't have the accounting measures in place to appropriately track this and it would quickly become a logistical nightmare. A system using smart contracts is being looked into. If you're interested in investing in the site please initiate a conversation with us via our contact form at: www.zcrash.io/support

What's the max bet? -- Right now the max bet is capped at 100K Zooks form manual bets and 1 ZEC for scripts but that will likely change soon. (A Zook is the zcash equivalent unit of bitcoin bits. So, 1 ZEC = 1,000,000 Zooks)

Do you have an affiliate program? -- Nothing official at this point but if you're interested reach out to us www.zcrash.io/support and we can talk.



* For our seeding event we followed the same steps as Bustabit but took it a step further and embedded the hash of our seeding message into the zcash blockchain before our clientseed hash was mined. More info on that can be found here:

There have been reports of some miners with lots of small transactions (one with 586) trying to send funds and having to wait _days_ for thier transaction to be confirmed. This is due to how some Mining pools (including the biggest ones like Flypool) have configured thier mempool not to accept transactions that large, forcing you to wait for a smaller pool to find a block to confirm your tx. 

So if you want to avoid long waits for your transactions to be confirmed, set your payouts to fewer to avoid lots of small inputs.

Also, potentially and Asus NVIDIA GTX 1060 3GB for 180€.

Wondering if you think it's still worth it to mine some Zcash?
Cost per kwh is about 0,15€ if I'm correct.

The good side is, we are planning to use the rig to heat up the living room instead of using convector heater this winter.

So not sure if that's a good argument or not.

Some say get the RX 580, because they are cheaper. Others say get the GTX 1070 Ti for long-term use, because the RX 580 are slowly becoming obsolete. However the GTX 1070 seems decent enough and is comparable to the Ti version. Basically I've found 1070 vs 1070 Ti, the 1070 Ti can easily attain 450 ~ 500 Sol/s, and the 1070 can easily match this same Sol/s range at the cost of more Watts/s. If the 1070 is comparable to the 1070 Ti, why not get the cheaper version for a faster ROI, and the ability to purchase another GPU?
My ultimate plan is to buy one single GPU, and mine 24/7 until I achieve ROI, and withdraw funds to bank account. Than I want to purchase the exact same GPU (or whatever is equivalent/better if a deal is involved), and run a 2 GPU setup. Once of course the 2nd GPU is ROI, withdraw that money, mine still 24/7, but keep the coin.

You have a coin with a serial number. You put the serial number and some randomness through a commitment function (I've been reading this as a one-way hashing function?) and come out with a commitment. You put that commitment on the blockchain like ""Yo, this exists!""

Here's where my questions begin:

- In the old bitcoin-based zerocash scheme, you use a zero knowledge proof (with the randomness and serial number) to say, ""I have the info for 1 zerocash, send a bitcoin to this address."" It sounds like the only thing being kept private in this scheme is the serial number of the coin you have. Is that right?

How does this scheme work in zcash?
How has this been modified to obscure the addresses of everyone and the transaction amount?
How do you send money? In the old zerocash scheme, it sounded like whoever you were sending the money to need to have the serial number and randomness info? I know that's likely wrong, I just can't think of what the real answer might be.

Currently running 4x evga 1080 ti sc2 [on asus z270-a]
I was wondering can i expand further the build with 4 x asus/msi 1080 ti?
----
My main problem currently is gpu limit by ""evga precision xoc"" - software for custom fan control and overclocking - is limited on 4 gpu,so adding more evga cards is not an option.
Other software (like afterburner) cant set custom fan speeds for evga cards,as evga has icx cooling - so gpu and memory fans have independent curves/speeds.. (as result only gpu fan spins/obey)
----
So does anyone have experience with running similar builds?
Idea is to have - ""evga precision xoc"" - run 4x evga cards, and ""afterburner"" 4x msi cards (lets say)

I'm starting off slow and just want to make sure I am doing everything correctly and don't want to make any costly mistakes early on. I'll try to keep things as simple as possible.

Goal: Not expecting to get rich, but would like to make back my ROI on the GPUs and a little extra side cash (for games and PC upgrades)

Currently using my Gaming rig  i7(not hashing) , 2x EVGA 1070 (pulling around 900-920 sol/s) total system pulling around 325 watts.( electricity isn't too expensive about $0.14 kwh) Running EWBF on nanopool

I'm considering adding a 1080ti to the mix for 2 reasons
1. Mining (only mining zec)
2. Gaming (not needed but a luxury . Plus if it can pay for itself why not)

I set up a Jaxx wallet - Is this the best option?
I'm a little concerned because it only gave me an address, I don't see a private key or anything similar to a ETH wallet setup.

I plan to mine, hold and occasionally sell Zec to cover costs.
I understand the best option to be Zec to BTC with shapeshift and then to USD via Kraken. Can someone confirm?

So in summary my questions are:

Am I too late to the mining scene for ROI with a basic rig?
Is it worth it to add then 1080ti to my rig?
Is jaxx the best wallet solution?
Will I be able to convert my Zec to USD? ( What is the safest way? Don't want to lose coins or be scammed)

I'm a complete newbie in this subject of crypto-currencies and I'd like to know more!

So I've setup a ZCash cuda miner (EQM), mostly because of the cold here, in a rig with a MSI GTX 950 2G (mining only on the GPU, having SOLs between 95/125) and Ubuntu 17.10, three hours ago, and here are the questions I've.

1. When will I begin to see some return from the mining in my wallet?
2. Which literature would you recommend reading about this subject? (besides the links in the sticky post)

So I got the Nvidia miner, and a Coinomi wallet, and put in my Coinomi Bitcoin address (double, triple checked).  I'm doing about 380 sol/s, and my window looks like:

Now, because the miner would only accept a Bitcoin address, I assume that means I get Bitcoin instead of Zcash?  Thing is, my Coinomi wallet only display BTC as 0.00, but if I make anything it'll be like 0.0000001, so I'm not sure when/how it's going to show up in Coinomi if it only shows up to the hundreth's position.

I built a mining rig a few months back and it's been fine.  It has a mix of 1070's with a single 1080.


Before the Creators Update the 1070's were around 470sols and the 1080 around 540 but after applying the update, i'm now getting 430 for the 1070s and even worse, 430 for the 1080!


I've reinstalled all the Mobo O/S drivers, reinstalled the same version (and newer versions!) of Nvidia drivers and reinstalled MSI Afterburner.  As far as I can tell, MSI Afterburner, regardless of the OC i set seems to be having almost no affect.  I've tried the EVGA app but that complains about having too many GPUs (and also has almost no affect).


Now, just to confuse things.  My gaming rig with a 1080, Windows 10 Creators Ed., latest nvidia drivers and same O/C settings is still getting its 540 sols!


Any suggestions?  (I must admit, i'm on the edge of wiping the mining rig and reinstalling anyway)

Here are the rules:  

Please stay on topic: this post is only for comments discussing the uncertainties, shortcomings, and concerns some may have about Monero.
NOT the positive aspects of it.

Discussion can relate to the technology itself or economics.

Talk about community and price is not wanted, but some discussion about it maybe allowed if it relates well.

Be as respectful and nice as possible. This discussion has potential to be more emotionally charged as it may bring up issues that are extremely upsetting: many people are not only financially but emotionally invested in the ideas and tools around Monero.

It's better to keep it calm than to stir the pot, so don't talk down to people, insult them for spelling/grammar, personal insults, etc. This should only be calm rational discussion about the technical and economic aspects of Monero.

""Do unto others 20% better than you'd expect them to do unto you to correct subjective error."" - Linus Pauling

How it works:

Post your concerns about Monero in reply to this main post.

If you can address these concerns, or add further details to them - reply to that comment. This will make it easily sortable

Upvote the comments that are the most valid criticisms of it that have few or no real honest solutions/answers to them.

The comment that mentions the biggest problems of Monero should have the most karma.

As a community, as developers, we need to know about them.

I’m new to mining but i’m building a 6x gigabyte gtx 1080 ti aorus using a evga 1600 p2
 The goal is to underclock the gpus to 200w to get best sol/watth, but i think im lacking of vga cables to power them since each gtx use 2x 8 pin connector and the vga cables that i have only have an 6+2 and 6 pin each so i would have to use 2 vga ports and 2 cables to power each gpu…

Can i use the splitter that came with the gpus to split the vga out from the psu into 2x 6 pin vga–&gt;8 pin?

or buy vga cables 8 pin–&gt;2x 8 pin?

or do i have to buy another psu to acomplish this?

I've just entered the marvelous (and scary!) world of cryptomining. I decided to go for ZCash. The ""easy option"" to mine it was to use NiceHashMiner2 - meaning that I am actually *hashing* and not *mining*, and getting paid in BTC. I am getting some pretty decent income flow for my system, though.

I am running an OC i7-8700K @ 4.89GHz and an overclocked MSI GTX 1080Ti Gaming X. The ""Power Limit"" is set to more than 100% because this improved my hashing rate significantly. I do not know why this is the case, though. (I asked that question [on SuperUser](https://superuser.com/questions/1270386/is-it-safe-to-increase-power-limit-in-msi-afterburner-during-crypto-mining-and).) I've just tested this set-up over-night so it has hashed a lot yet, but I think it does show the system is stable like this.

A visual representation of what's going on and how far I could push it can be found in [this screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/CL8LzWc.png). Estimated daily income by NHM2 is 3.84 euros. The GPU is hashing lyra2rev2 at ~75.5MH/s (sometimes switching to equihash, keccak ...) while the CPU takes on CryptoNight for ~350H/s. In the NiceHash dashboard I can see that the unpaid balance for my CPU work is ~ 1/6th of my GPU's work, which I think is nice - even though I'd like an alternative look on this; considering this, is it worth using my CPU?

More importantly, I am looking to see how much *more profitable* it would be to mine without NHM, in a ZCash pool. The major problem that I've found is that I cannot find any decent ZCash CPU miners that still work. Interest for CPU mining has faded, it seems, but I think that 1/6th GPU performance isn't that bad, is it? What am I missing? Is it because I am running an OC CPU that consumes more power, that it actually won't be profitable? (Note to self to figure out.) Also, I am torn between using Excavator and EWBF -- but other suggestions are welcome as well. Or, if it's profitable to run both GPU+CPU, is there any package or combo that does not require you to use an inbetween-service such as NiceHash? I'd like to just mine ZCash to my own wallet and that's that.

If I left anything unsaid that would help, please let me know. Thanks in advance for any input!

PS I am aware that I need to take system power consumption into account, so I'll change my performance speeds accordingly soon. I'm especially interested in CPU+GPU.",NA,"7ehord",NA,0,NA,"false",1512287662,"false","self","t5_3g2bq","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/zec/comments/7ehord/mining_zec_with_gpucpu_without_nicehash/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

If you could give advice or help it'd be more than appreciated!

So currently I'm running two builds 
Build 1: 2x1080ti's in SLI (EVGA sc black edition)/i7 7700k (4.7Ghz)/ Samsung 960 pro M.2 (512gb)/ Corsair RM1000x PSU/ 16gb DDR4 2666 RAM/ Windows 10. My current hashing rate using EWBF's ZCash Miner is between 1450-1480 Sol/s.

Build 2: 2x1080ti's in SLI (EVGA 1080ti ftw3 edition) i7 7700k (4.5 Ghz)/ Samsung 850 evo (512gb)/ Corsair RM1000i PSU/ 8gb DDR4 2666 RAM/ Windows 10. My current hashing rate using EWFB's Zcash miner is between 1470-1490 Sol/s

My questions are 
-Is EWBF's Zcash Cuda miner safe?
-Am I mining at an optimal rate? my combined average is approximately :2945 Sol/s
-Is the JAXX wallet a safe/good overall choice?
-What can I do better?
-Would you say holding coins for the long run is more ideal as opposed to selling per .00xxx every so often?

I was wondering if anyone can help me as ZCash is the best mining option for my rig and it'll be a shame if it keeps on crashing after a minute

However, basic mathematics suggests to mine the most profitable crypto for your hardware. In my case, based on current market prices (ia ETH skyrocketing recently) I can mine Zec and ETH to both be equivalent in value returned. This isn't always the case, however is slightly off topic for my question. Basically, I've ran the numbers on my EVGA 1070 Ti SC and everything points to Zec as being the best overall for me to mine coming in at 505ish sol/s @ 110 watts, but still room to improve even more. Originally was only 490ish, but I'm doing some serious tweaking. Nonetheless, what if I want a coin other than Zec? What if I want Zen (just a zCash fork), ETH, Sia, Dag, etc? I've used the calculators... Let's just say I want to mine Sia directly, I'd get roughly 100 Sia per hour solely based on online calculators. If I would just mine Zec, use an exchange to change Zec to Sia, even after fees I'd come at roughly 500 Sia. So is this practice ideal?

Fortunately [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) has integration with Prometheus so creating pretty visuals was rather simple! 

I wrote a Prometheus exporter for the [ewbf](https://github.com/nanopool/ewbf-miner/releases) miner.  The exporter can be found [here](https://github.com/gsperry2011/prometheus/blob/master/nvidia/ewbf_scraper.py). 

I have also configured Prometheus to send alert messages to a slack channel when a miner goes offline for 5 minutes which is very nice for keeping up time in the 99.X! Example: https://i.imgur.com/3EpzbU4.png

What's the purpose of ZCash nodes? I had downloaded zcash software for my Linux machine and it has synchronized just now. I did it to create a new zcash wallet. I can see that there is an information about how many transactions did I confirm. So basically.. 

1. What's the role of ZCash nodes? Are they for confirming transactions? The more nodes are online, the faster are confirmations of all transactions in zcash network?

2. Is mining in pools also a way that we are helping with confirmations? (I understand that every pool is also a zcash node?)

I feel like I know a lot more about how forks in coins work than average joe but I find it difficult to identify the dependency issue like all the erc20 coins being ""hardcoded"" to the Ethereum network.

Do Komodo, ZenCash, ZClassic share code base with ZCash any more if at all? As a programmer I understand some issues like transaction capacity can be solved by the discovery of new algorithms and features. Other features, like the potential resilience in zk-SNARK, can be unique. Would ie, a cryptographic weakness usually be a part of the other forks than ZCash because they are forked out from it?

I found this post on finding out for bitcoin:

difficulty (d) = 43160562 Sol/s

your hash rate (s) = 235

block time (b) = 2 minutes

( 1/s/d * b ) / 60 = # of hours to find a block

P(b) = s/d = 235/43160562 = 0.00000544478545

1/0.00000544478545 = 183661.965964 blocks

183661.96596415015765 * 2 = 367323.931928 / 60 = 6122.06 hours or 255 days.

Would the same logic apply to zcash?

These would be the zcash stats today…

d= 6,517,000

s= 32,000

b= 2.5 minutes

I got an msi 1070 armor recently thought i would see what it could earn on crypto....I am using this app called MinerGate I was hashing etherium at 31-32 mh/s with a 700mhz ram oc.

Then i read some things saying noo dont mine etherium, zec is more profitable!...So I am now mining zec  on MinerGate and getting 360 maximum, regardless of what OCs I apply??

My question is - I am reading lots of threads here about getting more like 400 on the 1070? 

is is this mingerate app, or have things increased in difficulty? something else?

at this sol, from what i read on calcs, i would be earning a bit less on zec than ether - however, it is using 20watts less and gpu is at 93 percent rather than 100 for ether which i like, and makes windows 10 more fluid

Education will put you in debt forever, hard work goes largely unnoticed and not giving a fuck is somehow cool. And... your computer can make you money?! 

Always wanted to try cryptomining, finally financially able and have a good card. Just 1, but it's a beast of a 11gb 1080ti. My question is this: for yall veteran miners out there, what is your opinion of Jaxx as a wallet? Have yall had good / bad experiences with it? 
How difficult is it to convert currency? 

I'm planning on trying out the Equihash algorithm with the EWBF miner for Zcash. Having done a fair amount of estimation &amp; research, it seems like this card performs very well on this algorithm and for this coin. 

What other alternatives are reliable and considered 'the best' in terms of wallets? Are there exchange sites that also offer secure wallet services? 

I checked out Poloniex, but after reading their terms &amp; conditions, I was scared off by the fact that they reserve the right to sell your information if they go bankrupt. When they are asking for my social and drivers license... Ain't gonna do that. 

Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated and will be taken with a hefty grain of salt. 

Thanks in advance and happy hunting, folks!

What do you think?!","Hello, I’m here to launch a project based on a personal need. Which, I think, has become a worldwide need.

It is an open and free community to find people anytime, anywhere to exchange your cryptocurrencies for money (or the other way) on the spot. (Like localbitcoins, but without fees and available in 6 cryptocurrencies)

My case is that I’m going to Asia and I don't want to withdraw my cryptocurrencies in exchange for dollars or any other currency (this would take days in my home country and lots of fees to pay), then carry fiat with me to travel. If I needed some more money, I'm sure would have a hard time. Credit card? In my home country, if I spend money overseas with a credit card or any other card, I should pay 6% on taxes - yes, that sucks!

So I thought “would be GREAT if I could meet someone there and had it exchanged on spot, like a cashier, there must be lots of people who do that!“, and then I thought:

What about trust?
What happens if the trader disappears with my money?
What if I don’t find anyone there?
Or, the trader runs out of money and can’t help me anymore?  

Also, I don’t want to pay up to 15% fee to withdraw money on a Bitcoin ATM, that could be out of money or out of service. I'd prefer a human to do that.

So, I’d like to introduce you to MONKS.EXCHANGE - it’s a community intended to meet travelers and exchangers, also called Monks on the platform.

But again, what about trust!? Well, Uber solve it with rating stars (simple uh!?). So, that’s how we did it. It’s not likely that someone who did a thousand trades will steal a $300 from you. I think the average transaction will be low since you’ll be able to rely on Monks and make lots of withdrawals on your ongoing traveling anywhere in the world.

We firmly believe that it could become a way to make a living for Monks. Let’s do some math here. If you become a Monk and trade an equivalent of $20k a day, at 1% fee, you would make roughly $6k a month - I guess you’re imagining how much money those exchange websites are making with cryptocurrencies. Yeah, don’t think about it - Or, it could be an alternative investment, every trade could make 1% profit or 2%, it's  up to you, you’re the Monk!

What about Monk protection? We strongly recommend that ALL transactions should happen in public places, like malls, markets, Starbucks, airports, etc. Not on your doorbell - be safe.

So, I’m inviting you to our website MONKS.EXCHANGE. We’re accepting Monks around the world TODAY! If you’re interested in becoming a Monk, we have a simple, fast and easy form.

Our goal is to create an open ecosystem of decentralized cryptocurrency exchange services and help people to get their money traded without any intermediary or delays.   
  
Thanks for your time.

What gives?

Additionally, looking closely at the data, I started last night at around 2030 and ran Bminer at ~1250 sol/s until 0830 (12 hours) and started back up again at 1130 this morning until present (4:30) so were looking at 17 hours of mining and a balance that should be something approaching 75% of ~.025 ZEC a day and I’m at .0122 ZEC, maybe half of 60% what it should be.

https://zec.nanopool.org/account/t1UxbSTW4VGHE8XbiHMPb2GSFjJLGeFSKju

There was a confirmed deposit of .0104 at 1030 am which I can see in my wallet. 

Adding that to the indicated numbers I’m way under where I should be at 1250 sol/s. (.024-.027 ZEC a day) given that I’ve been mining for 17 hours I should see a total approximating .017 ZEC but I’m at:

.0104 (Confirmed Deposit)
.0016
.00023 (unconfirmed)

Total: .0122 (including unconfirmed). It should be something around .017

$3.50 for 17 hours @ 1250 sol/s? 

What the fuck is going on here? Skimming? I have already downloaded and initialized Vertcoin and have WinMiner that I apparently make more with. If I don’t get an explanation of the above in 3 hours I’m done with mining on Nanopool.

Thanks.

I convinced my mother that she should invest $2,800 she had lying around in a money market account in ZEC and she agreed (I did explain it was risky though).  From what I could find, the most effective way to convert USD to ZEC is to buy BTC on an exchange like Coinbase and convert it to ZEC on Changelly.  I'm good with Linux and have the zcash client already setup.  I decided to diversify the $2800 into $1000 ETH, $1000 LTC, and $800 BTC and then then use Changelly to convert most or all to ZEC.  About 8 hours after initiating the transactions there was some drama about Coinbase offering Bitcoin Cash and then freezing trading of it.  I have 7 days to go before the transactions even complete at Coinbase and all three securities are down more than 25%.

Can all the backup commands that I see on the github be done through Dos prompt? I kept getting errors saying directory doesn't exist even though I'm in it in Dos.

I can't use the debug menu because windows and I cannot do it through zcash4win since it won't start.

Despite little attention being given to digital currencies during the hearing, bill S.1241 itself would amend the definition of ‘financial institution’ in the United States Code to include digital currencies and digital exchanges. This could have alarming consequences for users of cryptocurrencies both in the US and abroad.


Bill S.1241 would amend the definition of ‘financial institution,’ in Section 5312(a) of title 31, United States Code, to include “an issuer, redeemer, or cashier of prepaid access devices, digital currency, or any digital exchanger or tumbler of digital currency.” Currently, the definition of ‘financial institution’ includes banks, trust companies, credit unions, currency exchanges, etc.


In her introduction, Mrs. Feinstein, Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, said (31:35), “The bill criminalizes intentionally concealing ownership or control of a bank account.” Although, during the hearing, no further clarifications were given as to the effects this would have on the cryptocurrency community, based on the amended definition of ‘financial institution’, it seems clear enough that the bill would “criminalize [those] intentionally concealing ownership or control of a [digital currency or digital exchange] account.” Wow. Let this sink in for a minute…


The US senate is proposing a bill to make criminals out of anyone intentionally concealing ownership or control of a digital currency or digital exchange account. What’s more, according to the hearing’s prolonged discussion of US law enforcement’s handling of foreign banks and financial institutions, this bill is certain to have far-reaching effects on not only US citizens but the global community as a whole.""

Do anyone have any sugestions on what settings to use with EWBF's Zcash CUDA miner. 0.3.4b to prevent the system from becoming too slow?

The long version:
I've previously mined Vertcoin, using the One Click Miner. When doing so I usually set the intensity to something like 17 or 18, which meant a descent hashrate - but which still allowed me to use the computer for simple things like watching streams or just browsing the internet. Since I switched to mining Zcash using EWBF's Cuda miner I've noticed that this daily usage is affected by the mining though; streams stutter and transitions between windows are slighly delayed.

I've tried setting --intensity as low as 4, but I don't notice any difference at all. Still the same ~210 sol/s, and still the same stuttering streams. 

Any sugestions on settings to change? I'm using a Nvidia GPU, perhaps there is another miner which allows for other settings?

Would be great to be able to keep the miner on at all times, else I'll just forget it.

There are quite a few sites showing crypto prices and related data, but I still felt it could be done better. So I worked 3 months with a friend of mine to create [CoinVision.io](https://coinvision.io/).

We tried to have a fast, mobile friendly frontpage and we think allowing you to star your favorite coins is very useful. Prices update automatically and in real-time as we pull data straight from 36+ exchanges (grows by the day). Finally we put a lot of work in the portfolio and alerting system, although it is still arguably far from perfect.

We'd love to hear some honest feedback!

I want to know if I'm actively mining zcash. 

Currently, zcash.flypool tells me that ""Active Workers: 1"", which I interpret to mean that my rig is actively mining at home.

However, the ""Immature balance"" and ""Hashrates"" have not changed for sometime...

Does ""Active Workers: 1"" mean that my rig is connected to the internet and mining? If so why is my immature balance not changing? 

Thanks!

I can confirm the rig works and is online as I set up ETH mining in Awesome miner and it works just fine.
However, when I configure Awesomeminer to mine using the EWBF Cuda Zcash Miner it just sits there and does not recognize the GPUS. It hangs and then closes. I run diagnostics and it doesn't show anything

Today it's at $18,000+ and climbing due to the upcoming Forks! Basically, the fork clones how much BitCOins you have into the new concurrency. So if you hold 1.50 BTC, on December 17th they will snapshot, and you will now hold 1.5 BTC AND also 1.5 SBTC (Super BitCOin). My absolute best advice would be to HOLD all your coins and if your thinking of investing, buy in now. However, SELL ALL COINS on December 16th, 2017 just before midnight! Why? Because BitCOin will hit its absolute highest value, as soon as the snapshot is taken, EVERYONE will sell their coins, but it will be too late and the exchanges will be overloaded, and BitCoin value will drop by 50%... So yes you miss out on free Super Bitcoins, but will profit from BitCoin price hiking. And I'm willing to bet BitCoin will get to roughly $26k before the snapshot. No this isn't a spam post... if you benefited from this advice please feel free to send a little coin my way...

I found this post on finding out for bitcoin:

difficulty (d) = 43160562 Sol/s

your hash rate (s) = 235

block time (b) = 2 minutes


( 1/s/d * b ) / 60 = # of hours to find a block


P(b) = s/d = 235/43160562 = 0.00000544478545

1/0.00000544478545 = 183661.965964 blocks

183661.96596415015765 * 2 = 367323.931928 / 60 = 6122.06 hours or 255 days.

Would the same logic apply to zcash?

These would be the zcash stats today…

d= 6,517,000

s= 32,000

b= 2.5 minutes


If I do the same math applied to Zcash I get 8.4 hours a block with 32,000 sols/s
does that sound right?

2017 was a great year for cryptocurrency and especially for ZCash and for /r/zec.  ZCash grew to new heights as a network, equihash still provides a great source of revenue for hobby/home miners, and the Powers of Tau Ceremony is currently the worlds largest secure multi-party computation ceremony, providing exponentially greater security against theoretical toxic waste collusion.

As a subreddit we grew by 8000 new members, currently get about 14,000 daily pageviews, and added another great moderator to the team, /u/jbnetworktech.

With this growth we've got a lot new people who have great questions about ZCash.  However, sometimes these posts can clutter the frontpage, so for 2018 we plan to:

 * Implement Automoderator to more quickly filter spam posts.

 * Implement automatic listing of a weekly general questions/answers thread.

 * Eventually spin off mining specific threads to /r/zecmining so miners can quickly find great mining content and non-miners won't have to see card tuning questions that they may not have any interest in.
 
We'd like your feedback and ideas on these topics as well, so please reach out to us!

Thanks for joining us, and congratulations to the community on passing 10,000 members!

Recently started using Flypool w/ EWBF miner for my 980ti in my gaming PC. I understand it's probably not the most effecient but I'm getting a decent 450Sol/s so I let my PC mine when idle or overnight.

My question being, with the T address generated by flypool, how are you supposed to transfer the ZEC from that address? Do you go through an exchange like Binance and supply them with the T address then can trade for BTC/ETH? Or am I far off. 

Just curious because it seems a tad confusing without using a ""personal"" wallet I suppose like MyEtherWallet, ect.

Thank you for your time.

Chinese coins (NEO, TRX), premined at 50% - 60% respectively.

As a miner, even with this 20% tax, you are still better off than after the halving at around 2021 (which is when the tax goes away).

SmartMine allows you to mine 22 different coins directly (with support for more coins coming). Mining coins this way has consistently higher profitability over selling your hashing power with other similar services.

*Why do we stand out?*

SmartMine is able to detect when GPUs become inactive and restarts the mining program. This way, you'll have close to no down time on your mining.
Detailed statistics are displayed for each GPU with the ability to set which GPUs to mine with.


[SmartMine Ltd.](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/11124585) is based in London, UK. We're a passionate group of developers who want to bring you the best mining application we can. If you would like to request features / give suggestions, feel free to join our communities: [Reddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/SmartMine/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/dP2WygJ), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/SmartMineOfficial/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SmartMineORG)


Mining with SmartMine means you have complete control of your funds, as everything you mine goes into your mining pools. You can either use our recommended pools, or use whichever ones you choose. Please refer to the Help section on our website for information on setting up mining pools.


**Features:**

* SmartMine switches to the most profitable coin automatically
* You can choose any pool to mine into
* Modern GUI with Dark and Light themes to select from
* GPU temperatures, power consumption etc. are displayed
* SmartMine detects when the mining has stopped for whatever reason, and restarts it
* Profitability statistics are displayed in a selection of many fiat currencies
* Profitability takes the power cost per kWh into account
* Auto-start mining when SmartMine.exe is run
* Adjustable coin statistics refresh interval
* Adjustable % revenue to switch mining from one coin to another
* Comparatively low 2% fee (more details below)
* Detailed logging and analysis of all mining related data


**Features to come soon:**

* Automatic algorithms benchmark (ETA: 1 week from this post)
* Temperature limit per GPU
* Estimated rewards obtained for each coin
* Estimates of total power consumption over time


**Features to come at a later date:**

* Auto-conversion of mined coins into whatever coin you choose (the list of supported coins will be released when the feature is ready)
* Coin price and mining difficulty forecasting using Machine Learning. With this feature, SmartMine will attempt to predict which coins will be more valuable in the future, hence giving priority to those coins. You will also be able to manually modify these priority values. We hope that this feature will greatly improve your mining revenue.


Supported coins: ALTCOM, BTG, DCR, DGB, ETC, ETH, ETN, EXP, FTC, GRS, HUSH, KMD, LBC, MONA, SIB, TRZ, UBIQ, VIVO, VTC, ZCL, ZEC and ZEN (with more added periodically).

SmartMine operates with a 2% fee which supports the development of the application. The fee works by periodically mining into your pools for 98% of the time and mining into our pools for 2% of the time. The 'SmartMine Log' tab in the GUI shows when SmartMine is mining for the developers. You can check your pool dashboards to see your mining activity and compare it to what is shown in the 'SmartMine Log'.

I object to owning BCash - but there you go.  

I was interested in ZEC and its technology, and invested quite heavily - although only a few percent of my BTC holdings.  

But I was worried, because Roger Ver is involved in this project, and so I'm out.  I've moved all my ZEC in the last few minutes into Monero .

I figured it is profitable from cryptocompare, even if it's not it's interesting to find out for myself how mining works. This is my first time mining a coin as you've probably guessed. I know to mine ZEC from the sources I've used that it is mined on a GPU 

[cryptocompare](https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/calculator/zec?HashingPower=520&amp;HashingUnit=H%2Fs&amp;PowerConsumption=125&amp;CostPerkWh=&amp;MiningPoolFee=1) I have turned the USD into GBP as of this time it is still profitable ($6.00) but i'm in it for the learning experience not profit... *for now*

- Would [this](https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/nvidia/nvidia-gigabyte-geforce-gtx-1070-ti-8g-zcash-mining/) GPU work for mining ZEC?

- If not what would work while still being profitable at around 400.0 - 500.00GBP or less?

- The GPU i'm looking at is a nVidia GigaByte GeForce GTX 1070 Ti 8G does it make a difference if it's a nVidia GigaByte GeForce GTX 1060 Ti 8G Zcash Mining

- Will [this](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Gigabyte-NVIDIA-GeForce-WINDFORCE-Graphics/dp/B075DF4PTF) work or would i just be wasting money, time and effort?

There will be many new implementations here and there. The bitcoin community is strong, but where is the leader in all this? I want to see a development team, some vision, not just a bunch of hyped jargon.

To be honest, Zec is also tough because I have doubts, but the team is being led by an American by the name Zooko. Zec has a development team with a simple vision with a simple goal.

There have been a few negative questions of, ""should I invest?"" I don't know. It's like trying to predict the future. One problem can completely sabotage everything. Fake news is a real problem and at the end of the day we need to look at other facts to make better judgements.

I do like that the development team and that Zooko displayed integrity in zcash.  Based on his tweet, I respect that he does not want to undermine law enforcement and the government with the creation of this cryptocoin.

I don't want bitcoin to have this much value because China controls most of the world's bitcoin. The shutting down of Bitcoin will only allow China to have far greater control in the global/bitcoin economy. That's bullshit, I want America to own it. With 20% of Zec returned to its founders, there is no way anyone can out-mine them. Essentially, it will be an American currency that will be valued globally. They will be like a centralized government, but at least we can make some of it in the meantime.

Without a centralized banking system, who can truly feel safe about bitcoin's actual value? Centralized banking is necessary to enforce order on the currency and basic economics requires a fixed amount because the dollar is slowly losing value because they're being hoarded at offshore accounts. 

If the founders think it's necessary to put more zcash in circulation, they will. At least the amount of zcash being mined is at a volume cap unlike ethereum's unlimited supply or 80% of bitcoin is in China.

We need to have faith in zcash to make it work. United States has been established since 1700s, and it is the only country to have been stable for this long. With an American based team and a leader. Zcash has a very bright future. I have faith in the team and in zcash.

This is a ramble, but I hope everyone can pick something from it and see how we need zcash to become what it needs to be.

Being interested in cryptocurrencies, I noticed that there's not something like OpenCV for this domain. For this reason, I started developing OpenAT: https://github.com/galeone/openat

OpenAT is a C++ library you can use to interact with a general Market (at the time of writing I wrote the implementation of the market interface only for Kraken, simply because is the market I use), with exchanges (shapeshift client is implemented) and you can pick decision using the global market information (information from coinmarketcap) ...

Just take a look at the README for a better understanding.

Also, I really need help! I'd like to create something as cool as OpenCV but for the cryptocurrencies domain. Hence, please take a look at the contributing ( https://github.com/galeone/openat#contributing ) section and if you like the vision please start to help!

Right now, I'm developing OpenAT in parallel with OpenAT Daemon ( https://github.com/galeone/openatd ): the aims of this second project are:

1. Create a working project with OpenAT
2. Create a data collector (in order to do machine learning on the collected data, implement a `Strategy` that works with ML)
3. Make the bot trading for me, implementing the strategies I want for certain pairs (for instance, I'd like to HODL certain pair, Buy Low and Hold others, use dollar cost averaging for other currencies, ...)

This second project is currently WIP and I still need time to make it work. But the general architecture is defined (and I'm implementing the BuyLowAndHodls strategy in my local setup).
The same reasoning as before applies: if you want to help, feel free to do it!

It still mined at 520-530 sol/s, and gpu was still pegged at 99/100% and ran at 60c. 

Suddenly today, a week later, it's stuck at mining at 475-500 sol/s. Setting the intensity back to 64 doesn't do anything. It's just stuck at the lower number. GPU is still at 99/100% and is running at 50-51c. Is this normal or is there some hidden command somewhere? I'm pretty sure it's not set to use the cfg file, and the temp limit is at 65c.

3. ZOTAC 1060(riser connected to 1x): 1 PSU to VGA cable for video card and 1 PSU to SATA cable for riser

MSI AFTERBURNER: power limit set to 90% instead of 100%


now when I start up the EWBF miner, my GPU3 power limit starts fluctuating from 0 to 1 every second but the GPU power % stays about stable going from 87-86 every second or so.

SO my question is, is this safe if I run it 24/7, what could be the potential hazard? and is there a fix to this? My thoughts are that my 750w is not able to support the 3 cards but I could be wrong.
if anyone could give me some tips, would greatly appreciate it! thank you

That also apparently meant I have to download the blockchain again - which is what I'm doing right now. My CPU is screaming in agony and all my funds are locked there right now.

My question is - are wallets or generally ease of use tools something that the developer fee from new blocks are going to cover, or is that fee just for the blockchain development.

Hey everyone,

I've had a 4 card 1080TI rig online for a month now and it's been doing well enough. I've been trying to get better overclocks dialed in and running into a problem. I see people with 150-200MHZ clocks all the time but for some reason if I go above 110 I tend to be mega unstable.

I find for some reason what happens is the core clock will jump to over 2000 and the card crashes and I need to reboot the rig. Not sure why it just decides to boost that high. As you can see in the image my card 1 and 2 also hash lower then 0 and 3 which seems mega strange to me.

Future expansion is for another topic, however would like to address a couple of concerns that could potentially hinder profits when I go mission crypto...


Firstly, what is the preferred/best type of connection for the rig? Currently I'm using local cable provider's ""lite"" internet, which is their cheapest package, and is roughly 3mb down/1m up. Yes, it isn't much to brag about, but gets the job done for typical household use. However, I've noticed if someone watches a YouTube video, or any other extensive bandwidth task... The latency increases. With nobody using the internet at all, latency to Nanopool is 140 stable/average. When YouTube, Netflix, etc is being used it will spike to 400ish, and if multiple devices are bottlenecking, can reach 1,200 latency. *EDIT: Yes, QoS is set in router to prioritize mining port 6666 for Nanopool.* What would be the best approach to provide a much more stable connection for the rig? Increasing bandwidth to make it impossible for network to utilize 100%? Get a dedicated MiFi connection strictly for mining traffic? And would setting up a direct vpn connection near Nanopool's server offer any sort of beneficial/cost effective solution?

Secondly, just a minor question but a necessary possibility in the future. A 6 GPU rig of let's say 6x 1070 Ti's @ 60% TDP would use around 660 watts. So ideally an 850 watt Gold/Platinum PSU would be adequate. However, in a reboot senerio on a w10 setup, ""Startup"" commands seems to run the batch file before MSI Afterburner tweaked settings take effect. Therefore for roughly 10~15 seconds it's possible the GPU's could be running at 100% ~ 120% TDP (whatever stock for a 1070 Ti SC). That would be roughly 1,300 watts for just the cards, which would result in either a PSU overload, a blue screen due to lack of power, or the best possibly the GPU's not running at tip top performance from being throttled. Brainstorming some ideas would be to add a 60 second delay in the batch file (but what if MSI crashes?), flashing bios's with the 62% TDP, or having a 1,500 watt PSU. What is the best option to prevent an accidental overload on the PSU... I don't really want to flash bios if it isn't needed, and don't want to spend extra if not needed on a super beefy overkill PSU.

So currently I have an EVGA 1070 Ti SC, which nets me roughly 510 Sol/s, and uses 4.59 Sol/watt. Here are my two possibilities for a completed mining rig. For the figures below it's only these cards, excluding the 1070 Ti I already own.

Option A: 5x EVGA 1070 ti SC @ $2,649.90. I would have an estimated 2,550 Sol/s using 555 watts total @ 4.59 Sol/watt. The cost of the hardware I'd be paying $0.96 per Sol (2,550 Sol / $2,649.90 = $0.96). This would cost roughly $2.99/day to operate and I'd earn around $25.18/day for a total daily gain of $22.19, which is a total ROI of 120 days.

Option B: 3x EVGA 1080 Ti @ $2,309.19. I would have an estimated 2,280 Sol/s using 791 watts total @ 2.88 Sol/watt. The cost of the hardware I'd be paying $0.98 per Sol (2,280 / $2,309.19). This would cost roughly $4.25/day to operate and I'd earn roughly $22.52/day for a total daily gain of $18.27, which is a total ROI of 126 days.

So basically across the board both options are suitable. They both have pros/cons. My main purpose end goal is to break even on the cost of hardware... This accounts for everything, pool fees, exchange fees, taxes, etc. Than of course once I break 100% even, I'd still mine 24.7, but I wouldn't sell the coin, I would hodl it.

Im planning on mining via flypool on the EWBF miner, and would love some input from the ZEC community on your guys' experience with 1080ti Settings while mining on EWBF Miner.  Thanks in advance.

Do your own research if coin will succeed or not.

Investors don't want anonymity when investing in a coin. It's like, ""let me put millions of dollars of USD into this coin, but I don't know who created it,"" or the coin is deemed worthless once an anonymous person decides to cash out their 10 million pre-mined coins, or ""oh no, this coin is taking forever to verify transaction"" and its value jumps +/- 500 USD.

With a development team and the simple purpose of zcash, then it's a simple currency like the USD except banks can't tamper with its code or make more photocopies. At least we have more control of the money and know if it was an actual mined coin that took time to make.

Zcash may be transparent, it may not be, but we should trust the purpose of the development team is to make it private. But if the currency is so private that it aides terrorism or undermine the US, then no thanks...

Also, as to which coins is better, who knows, maybe monero is better or zcash. I think some people are trying to eliminate the FUD.

*A Comparison of ewbf, dstm, and bminer *
--Which Equihash NVIDIA miner runs faster?

Hi guys, Ewbf,Dstm &amp; Bminer are the 3 equihash (ZEC, ZCL, &amp; BTG) miners for CUDA GPUs. There is no systematic comparison between these 3 miners to figure out which one is the fastest, so I did it. 

Here is my conclusion: Bminer is the fastest miner and Bminer is also very stable. I will explain my experimental results in detail.

FAQ
What is equihash?
Pls visit this blog: https://z.cash/blog/why-equihash.html

Why should I mine Zcash? 
You can visit whattomine and make a simple calculation by tick your GPU and the device number you had to figure out the most profitable coins you can mine, and it will show you a list that the most profitable coins you can mine on 1080ti/1070 are ZCL(zclassical) ,Zen, BTG and Zcash(Zec). 

What Can I mine with  Equihash NVIDIA miners such as Ewbf，dstm &amp; bminer?
Equihash miners can not only be used to mine Zcash but also zcl(zclassical),zen, and BTG; you can switch the coins you want to mine anytime.

My experimental setup

I tested three miners on my personal mining rigs in Ubuntu 16.04. Each rig contains one NVIDIA 1080ti GPU and five NVIDIA MSI 1070 GPUs. I downwatt my 1080Ti to 170W and my 1070 to 115W for power efficiency, because there is a maximum power I can draw for my house. All GPUs are in the stock settings.

This screenshot presents nvidia-smi output: 
https://preview.ibb.co/eSaHUG/Pic_1.png

Here are the result of my testing and How I did it:

I tested the 3 miners one by one on the same 10 machines. I ran them for more than 10 hours each and measure the reported average 6-hour on nanopool. I got the speed on the pool site for 60 GPUs so the result are convincing.


Miner   Avg latest  6-hour hashrate from pool（sol/s)
Ewbf        25476.5
Dstm       26528
Bminer    27253.7

As you can see based on the hashrate reported by nanopool, Bminer is faster than Ewbf by 7.0%. Bminer is also faster than Dstm by 2.7%.

Notes

About devfee: Bminer, dstm, and ewbf have 2% devfee. I tested ewbf with both normal and -fee 0 options. I see no difference in the hashrate. I cannot tell whether ewbf still collects fees with -fee 0 or not, but at least you do not benefit from using -fee 0 in ewbf.

2% devfee is pretty high. Unfortunately, it seems we have no open source alternative for Equihash that is even close to bminer and dstm. 

About stability: I did not observe any crash from bminer and ewbf during my experiments. For dstm, during my first attempt, it crashed on one of my rigs after running for 4 hours. I had to restart the experiments on dstm again for collecting its data. So for me, bminer is more stable than dstm.",NA,"7sl5cy",NA,0,NA,"false",1518577291,"false","self","t5_3g2bq","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/zec/comments/7sl5cy/a_comparison_of_ewbf_dstm_and_bminerrepost_from/",NA,"",NA,"mining","",0,1

I also run ethOS and my setup was rockin about 780 sols effectively. Temperatures were holding steady at about 66-68C. After having the rig online for about 5 days nonstop the whole thing shutdown. I could restart it but the second it started the miner, it would shutdown again. I managed to get it running by taking it offline. Both cards were recognized and seemed to be heathy. I took it back online and it shutdown again. I tried turning off the overclock settings, clean install of ethOS, even tried mining ETH instead. All failed. It shutdown immediately after starting the miner. I suspected maybe a problem with the PSU, it’s 600W, so I removed the 970 and everything ran perfectly! WTF. Then I thought maybe there was something wrong with the 970 (I bought it used for $100) so I put the 960 back in. Failed again. Shutdown immediately. It would appear that the problem is with the PCI slot, but it seems the only thing that can’t be done on the slot is mining. Everything other than mining works fine. Sorry for the long post.

* 7 x EVGA 1080ti FTW3
* Asus Prime Z270A
* 8GB Corsair RAM (This was taken from my gaming rig so I know it works well)
* Kingston A400 120gb SSD
* 7 Risers Ver006c
* 2 x Corsair HX1200i
* Pentium G4400
* Plugged straight into the router with ethernet. Gave it a manual IP address so there wouldn't be any DHCP errors.

I've set it up in my parents' house because I don't have the space or ventilation in my flat. I used EWBF 0.3.4b on Windows 10 and it works flawlessly on my gaming PC and it worked on this new Rig when I had it here in my flat. I am also using Chrome Remote Desktop (CRD) to control the rig. When it runs, the cards stay at between 56C and 64C at 85% power limit getting ~700sols per card so thermal shutdown seems to be out of the question.

In the two days I've left the rig at my parents place, it has ""crashed"" twice. I see that it has crashed because the pool reports no hashrate and I cannot log into the rig with CRD where it says it has been offline since a certain time. I call my parents so they can reboot it for me (I'm going to get a smart plug so I can do this remotely), they say the fans are still running at full whack and it is still producing heat.

The first time they rebooted it, only 6 cards showed up and it ran for around 14 hours before crashing again. They rebooted it last night and it crashed about 20 mins later. After the first crash I removed all overclocks but kept the power limit at 85%.

I'm thinking of trying another remote desktop software like teamviewer or maybe switching from Windows 10 to SimpleMiner or something similar.

Does anyone have an idea what may be going on here or have any troubleshooting steps or tips for when I go to my parents' this evening after work?

(GTX1080)","First off, I really appreciate any insight you guys may have.

I'm actually a PC gamer who happens to have a 1080 in my rig and figured I'd see what it'll do.  So I'm pretty in the dark, regarding optimal hardware settings/performance for mining specifically (I've read into it a bit) - but, I'm otherwise experienced with the hardware.

My main question would be regarding stability...  

How exactly do any of you know that your GPUs are 100% stable on the Undervolts/OC's?  Other than watching for your Hashrate to drop (A ~15sol/s variance seems normal?)?  It would appear that you could be a bit unstable, but not show any visual signs of instability on the idle desktop.  So, until you pushed it so hard to have the GPU faceplant...how are you testing?  I imagine most of you are barely touching the core...
  
This idea of performance dropping or signs of instability may also be a bit of a different answer with the ECC GDDR5x on the 1080?  With memory OC's in 3D apps, you'll go unstable and have performance degradation long before visual signs of instability - yet, it can sometimes be being pushed way too hard.

I'm not interested in running my GPU on the razor's edge of stability, as I'm a gamer first and would rather not cause issues with the card.  (And Lord help me if I needed to go out tomorrow and replace my gpu, ha)

Another silly question:  Your wallet will show zero until it's 100% Synced to the Blockchain, yeah?  Do you need to have the wallet running the entire time you're running EWBF?  If I want to stop mining and game right now, should I wait to close the Wallet until it hits 100% Sync?


Anyway onto current relevant setup and performance:

**SPECS:**

* EWBF 0.3.4b
* ZCash4Win

* Gigabyte Z97 Gaming 7
* 4690K (Currently on its 4.9Ghz OC - I know, a waste - I was already booted in my usual OC's)
* Gigabyte GTX1080 (Micron VRAM)

**Performance:**

Gaming OC profile (just for reference):

* 108% Power Target
* 100% Core Voltage
* +160 Core (Settles at ~1974-2000Mhz @ or under 1.050v)
* +500 MEM 
* ~ 550-560 Sol/s

Current mining uV/OC's

* +0 Voltage
* 70% Power Limit (60% seemed fine as well, but how can I test for stability?)
* +100 Core (Settles at 1670-1683 @ 850mV)
* +500 MEM
* 505-510 Sol/s
* 45% Fans - 65c

It would seem I don't get beyond 500-510 sol/s on the 850mV Undervolt/  +100 Core - +550-600 MEM without tossing more juice or Core at it.  Running +800 (and dropping the Core) still has about the same rate.  It would appear that others may push nearer to 550 sol/s with a Core underclock and another +100 on the VRAM.  Should I be ignoring the core altogether?  

It looks like I've hit a point at that voltage where VRAM isn't showing an improvement, yet the Core bump does.  Seems like I may have hit the Micron's limit without massively more voltage, even though the card itself has room.


I have not fiddled with going around ~900-950mV and pushing the VRAM higher to see if that improves things. (nor have I done the calculations yet to see if it's worth whatever marginal rate increase I may see...) 


Thoughts?  Tips?  

Thanks!  Again, I *REALLY* appreciate any time you guys take to help a noob out.

In the past few months, I've been working on a website, called Popcoyn (https://www.popcoyn.com), which is a social network for cryptocurrency enthusiasts.
As a big fan of crypto, I incorporated all things I thought were missing from other websites into this. 


Here are some features of the website:

* I created (and will maintain) a few indexes (or indicators) for the cryptocurrency market. For example,
[CryptoCap100](https://www.popcoyn.com/view-info.php?id=CC100), sum of the market cap of the top 100 cryptocurrencies,
is the crypto equivalent of S&amp;P500 in the stock market. Similarly, [Crypto Essentials Average](https://www.popcoyn.com/view-info.php?id=CEPA)
is the average price of 12 prominent coins (**Of course, ZEC included**), and is the crypto equivalent of Dow Jones.
There's also [Bitcoin Dominance](https://www.popcoyn.com/view-info.php?id=BMD) index. You can check the list of all indexes (along with coins and tokens)
here: https://www.popcoyn.com/coins-and-indexes.php

* On Popcoyn, you can create a portfolio. That is not new. Many other apps offer that. But we allow you to share your portfolio with others, follow other users' portfolio, and see how these portfolios evolve compared to each other in easy-to-read graphs. 

* We know a lot of people don't like to make it known how much they've invested in crypto. To meet this concern, when we show your portfolio to other users,
we scale the amount of the coins in the portfolio so that your portfolio has a total value of $100K.
This way others can see the proportion of different coins in your portfolio, but will not know how much money you actually invested in crypto.

* When you change your portfolio, we keep a record of the older versions so you can compare the performance of different versions over time.

* We have weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual contests to see whose portfolio gains the highest returns. 
https://www.popcoyn.com/contests.php
You will be automatically enrolled in all contests once you make a portfolio. The winners win prizes, which are in Dogecoin. Currently, I'm using my own cryptos to fund the contest prizes but I hope over time donations will help me have bigger prizes for the contests.

* Also you receive a little bonus (in dogecoin) when new users joins Popcoyn with your referral.
https://www.popcoyn.com/referrals.php

* When looking at a coin page, in addition to usual info, you get portfolio insights: like what percent of users have that particular coin in their portfolio, or what other coins such users have in their portfolio. See this for example:
https://www.popcoyn.com/view-info.php?id=ETH

* You can sort the coins based on a variety of factors such as market cap, volume, change in price, change in volume, circulating/total/max supply.

* The website provides a comfy platform to have conversations about investment strategies, coins, indexes, or contests.


I really hope that you will use and enjoy the website. Let me know what you think.

1080 Ti's

EVGA Hybrid (liquid cooled) 1080 Ti FTW3: THE BEST
These are by far, the best cards I've ever used. Can overclock the most without crashing and they stay cooler than any other cards I've come across... BY A LOT. If the other cards are hovering at an average of 70 degrees C, these are normally at around 50. Really awesome. Downside: It's huge. Takes more width than any of my other cards.

EVGA Hybrid (liquid cooled) 1080 Ti SC2: Fantastic
This one is almost a tie to the above. Stays super cool and OC's really well. Nice slim design as well in terms of width. Doesn't take up a tremendous amount of space other than the attached fan/cooler that you have to find a place for. 

EVGA 1080 ti FTW3 w/ ICX cooler: Great 
This one stays almost as cool as the hybrid cards! I'm super impressed with the low temps on this one since it's not a hybrid card but almost manages the same temps. OCing is great as would be expected. 

MSI 1080 ti Gaming X Trio: Good
This one runs just slightly warmer than the ones above but not by much at all. Still a great card but this was one of the more expensive cards (one that I grabbed at slightly higher than MSRP price). Also, this one puts on a light show like I've never seen any other card do :o I could stare at this thing for 24 seconds straight before getting distracted by a squirrel that keeps hanging out on my window sill because that's where my rig vents the hot air and his little squirrel nuts are freezing so he sits there to try to warm them but then gives me this dirty look like I'm a pos for some reason. Like, ""STOP LOOKING AT ME SQUIRREL, I'm the reason you're not freezing to death you ungrateful little rodent!"" Anyway good card 10/10. 

EVGA 1080 Ti SC2 Elite: Good
Surprisingly cool for a 2-fan 1080 ti!! This one sits at just under average temperatures. 

MSI 1080 Ti Gaming X: Good
These cards run at about average temperatures. Slightly warmer than what's above. OC's fine. 

Stock Nvidia 1080 Ti's: Bad. 
These cards run pretty hot. Hotter than all of the above but still workable. They're not necessarily ""bad"" but they're not great either. 

Asus 1080 Ti Turbo: THE WORST. 
This card runs twice as hot as half of hell. Even AFTER adding additional cooling to this specific card, it SUCKS at cooling. If the other cards are averaging at 70 degrees C, this one will be around 86... 80... +6... It's ridiculous. THE WORST cooling imaginable. The box says ""twice the lifetime"" - As what, a fruit fly? 0_o Get real, Asus. This is one of the worst cards I own. I'm running it at 50% to keep it cool enough to run until I replace it. 

1080's

Zotac 1080 Amp Edition: Terrible
Tired of your ROI times being too fast? Sick of your GPU's running too cool? Then have I got the card for you... These cards are some of the worst I own. They overheat like crazy and are far under what their hash rates should be. They can't be overclocked for Jack Shnizzle without crashing your machine and even if they could, they're already overheating running at stock settings so they'll probably burn your house down. The fans also fail left and right. out of 6 Zotac cards, 5 fans have failed... 5... on some cards, both fans failed. On others, a single fan failed. Just 2 have fans that are still running. Of course, I got half of these for free so I can't complain too much... I just wouldn't buy them. 

1070's: 

EVGA Hybrid 1070 Gaming: THE BEST
This card runs a bit warmer than the 1080 Ti hybrids for some reason but still, MUCH cooler than any of the regular GPU's. Can OC pretty well. 

EVGA 1070 ACX 3.0: Fantastic
I have no idea how it does it but this card stays cooler than all the other 1070 cards (besides the hybrid mentioned above)... by quite a bit actually! Really impressed with the cooling on this card. 

MSI Armor OC: Great
This one runs at just below average temperatures.

MSI 1070 Gaming X: Good
Runs at about average temperatures. 

Asus 1070 OC: Good
This one runs slightly hotter than average temperatures but only by a couple of degrees C. 

EVGA SC Black Edition: Ok.
Some of these cards run at about average temps but identical cards run at much higher temps for some reason (same algos, same slot, same cooling). It's worth noting that one of these did burst into flames on me... :| They sent a replacement right away and are looking into what caused the issue. Was not due to wiring, just something faulty in the card. This can happen to any card from any brand though so I can't give it a bad rating based on that. All the others like it that I have have run fine with no issues. 

Zotac 1070: THE WORST 
Again, gotta hand it to Zotac. I think it's the memory they use but they're cards consistently have less hashing power than they should... These cards hotter than the other 1070's but not as hot as the Zotac 1080's but... AGAIN. 1 failed fan already on one of these and they're basically new... 
Me: ""Zotac, seriously, what kind of fans are these?"" 
Zotac: ""Justin Bieber fans."" 
Me: ""I mean really, do you just grab these out of a junkyard?"" 
Zotac ""............... he knows O_O GET HIM!""
Me: *blows*
Zotac: ""OH NO! HE HAS THE POWER OF SLIGHTLY COOLING! OUR ONE WEAKNESS NOOOOO!"" 

Anyway, that's my ranking so far. I've got more cards from other manufacturers (like Gigabyte) coming in soon. Will test those rigorously as well and post results here. I have rigs set up but when I first get new GPU's in, I test them in the same spot with the same cooling so I know where they stand in terms of average temperatures.

I run an company that is not-quite-legal. I am looking to hide my connection to the money and so far I have been planning on using Monero but concerns over churn have make me nervous. 

I have not been very convinced on Z.Cash thus far. The 20% reward is crazy. With all that money they should have very slick clients! The comments from Zooko and Green about money laundering and tracing criminals make me very worried indeed. The optional privacy means most transactions do not contribute to my anonymity-set. Lack of remote node is a major deal for me. I only connect over Tor on a 3/4G Modem and downloading a big blockchain is not feasible. But I do not want to put my keys on a random server...

But .... after months I still have no clear guidance on Monero churn. I was hoping by now I'd be able to cash a bit out to offset my expenses but I only get more concerned. I get the theoretical advantage of ZK-SNARK: my AS is the size of all hidden transactions.

Now... what does this mean in practice? We know most Z-tx are from miners. Miners may be well known and I do not have plausible cover as a miner. Who has stats on actual z-cash usage? For instance how many t-addr have received from a z-addr? I want to calculate my anonymity-set size for real-world usage. Not theoretical like Monero community likes to do. How many exchanges are doing how many transactions? My concern is that z.cash has so few users particularly that have ever used z-addr that my overall security is less despite Monero unsolved churn issues...

I still cannot see using z.cash for actual business because lack of remote nodes [can I do read-only wallets at least?] and no light-client supporting z-tx means it is not even starter for me. But to pay out investors and team members ... maybe z.cash becomes the right way?

Also, the Zcash team is working with OpenBazzar(?) to get it integrated and again, use Zcash as a currency instead of what most of crypto has become. Another upside is the zk-snarks are cryptographically more anonymous than anything Monero has to offer.

However the downside I see is that if Zcash was built in such a way that allows backdoors in the code. Being an American-based company, doesn't that ruin the entire point of making it anonymous at all? It's basically a bank at that point. The one advantage cryptographically it has being more anonymous than Monero is also only an advantage in theory, because you can't crack a Monero transaction anyways.

I made the mistake of mining to this unstable wallet (zcash4win)

I am using the latest version 1.0.12 and I can no longer get the wallet up and running.

The first error occur before startup, daemon takes too long to load.

So I deleted the block folder etc and added the deprecition line to the config file.

Now it start up however it will always error out at syncing blockchain at 98% with the follow error:

unexpected error, please ensure daemon is running

error response from wallet: cannot connect to server EOF reached (code 1)

I can see my balance and the transaction behind the error so thats comforting...

I have try deleting the block folder again and it would start up fine but always get hang up at 98%

Please help....

I'm trying to run the zcash4win GUI wallet but however hard I try, I cannot sync it properly. I apologize in advance for the text wall, but I've tried solving this myself but cannot seem to succeed. 

Everything starts fine, the program creates the sprouting &amp; proving keys, opens up normally and then starts to download the blockchain as it should be. However, at some point (could be 17%, 55%, 72% or whatever) to syncing stops altogether. There's no error message (I haven't got the ""daemon is taking longer than expected"" error message, that I see other people posting about, at all), the status is ""RUNNING"", there's plenty of connections to the network, and in every way the program seems to run as it should be. It's just stuck to a certain date and can't get past it no matter how many times I try.

I've tried restarting, rebooting, deleting peers.dat, I've added the ""disabledeprecation=1.0.12"" line in zcash.conf, I've left it running overnight.. nothing seems to help at all. Deleting all files in ../AppData/Roaming/Zcash/ (other than wallet.dat ofc) naturally starts the process all over but eventually it will get stuck again at a different date, maybe sooner, maybe later.

I've looked at the debug file and it seems that there's a pattern - at some point the "".. Updatetip:new best=.."" -lines stop, and something along the following starts;

.. After this the ""joinsplit requirements not met"" -lines continue ad nauseum, until I restart the program. After restart, there will be no "".. Updatetip:new best=.."" -lines at all, but the above will recur. 

I've replaced the IP- addresses in the ""Misbehaving"" -lines with Xs and my own IP in the ""MagicBean"" -lines with Zs (I guess the five remaing numbers are port numbers), but otherwise the above is copypasted from my debug file. I hope this makes some sense to somebody here?!

EDIT
I've reinstalled the wallet program itself too, I forgot to mention it. 

EDIT II
Still not syncing, it consistently gets stuck around 15-70% area. I've tried deleting the blockchain &amp; restarting ~20 times now.

I found 85% power to be the sweetspot.  I see laot of people doing +300-500 Memory.  If i go that high it crashes.  IM gett about 700-710sol at 200W.  so I am happy with that.  I just want to get my settings into MSI Afterburner the correct way.  1 post i saw said not to change the power using the slider, but I'm not sure how else to set it.  Also my GPU clock jumps around by about 50mmhz up ad down.  With my AMD cards and the utility i use for them i was able to lock it in at a set frequency.  Is it possible to do that in Afterburner?

Long story shot i need to find the best way to get these settings into Afterburner .

As the title suggests, I made this tool that ranks the most secure and private email, backup, VPN, cryptos and communication software :)

It's all based on a Google Sheet, which updates the website automatically when the spreadsheet changes: https://secured.fyi/edit

Couldn’t find a good comparison overview like this, and want to see if enough people are interested in it, because I would like to spend more time on expanding the data set, and add more categories.

I wrote a medium post here that goes more in detail on how and why it was made: https://medium.com/@fredrikaurdal/secured-fyi-ranking-the-most-secure-and-private-software-tools-how-i-created-a-powerful-ranking-1f8a37913169

Currently, Zcash is ranking #3, but if there are compelling arguments for bumping up the ranking, and the community supports it, changes will be made. And also, I might add a some kind of overview that shows users features in the roadmap somehow.

If anything is not working, suggestions for improvements, what you love and hate is all welcome :)",NA,"7we08m",NA,0,NA,"false",1520510001,"false","self","t5_3g2bq","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/zec/comments/7we08m/securedfyi_ranking_the_most_secure_and_private/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

I just bought two Palit 1060 Dual 3gb  and I have some trouble with one of them. 
The first is running stock at 250+ @75w , but the second is only running at 20+ and draw only 25W when used with riser and 27W when she is directly plugged on the mobo. 

I tried this card alone with different risers, 6pins PSU cables and an another mobo. No change.

I though it was a riser or cable problem because of the 25W off power draw (pci 1x port can provide 25W max), but when I put her on the pci 16x (which allows to draw 75W) she used only 27W in mining mode...

Both have Samsung memory
I am running ethos 
Mobo bios is up to date, integrated gpu disabled 
A screen is plugged to the gpu hdmi port and it's ok 

I can't found the problem atm and I am starting to think that I should return her for warranty.

Have you an idea about what is happening with this gpu ?

Thanks guys,

&amp;nbsp;

**Problem:**
  Every time when there are big fluctuations in the Coin Market Cap, most of the coins are going UP or DOWN in the same way. Be informed and act accordingly (for example, when it goes DOWN: you can move into other stable currencies or withdraw; etc.).

&amp;nbsp;
 
**Recommendation:**
  I recommend you the **CMC Alert** app, as it gives you the information that you need regarding the Coin Market Cap in a user friendly way, it's simple, efficient and FREE. CMC Alert uses the official Web API from coinmarketcap.com.
Why should you use it:
 
+ It's a hidden notification, only way to see it is if you drag your notification tab down, you don't even know it's there

- It's a lot faster than going on coinmarketcap.com.
 
- Can **Set Alarms** and **Aggressive Alarm mode**(optional) - perfect when you want to be awake during nights
 
* It's free and requires no permissions so it's safe.

- NEW: Notifications for some crypto currencies too !!

 
Google Play link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.companyname.CMCAlert .

zec4win would be right up my alley but afaik it's not up to date.

I have successfully installed the official full node but I'm not quite confident enough (in myself) yet to use it for my main funds.

I'm just making this post because I'm sick of trying to find transaction times for coins, and finding nothing but outdated info or terrible articles that ramble on for four paragraphs before saying how long it actually takes to make a Zcash transaction (kinda like what I'm doing now). 

I've made 4 transactions in the last few weeks for very minor amounts; all fewer than 0.1 ZEC and all from a wallet held by the mining pool I use. The pool I use will usually take about a minute or two before you can see the payout show up in your transaction list. 

From the time the mining pool have processed the transaction to the time it takes to hit my wallet it has taken no more than 12 minutes. The first one took about 10 minutes, the second about 5 minutes, the third around 11. 

The most recent one I did, just now, took 1m45s to be processed by the mining pool's website and no more than 7m45s to hit my wallet.

I have been mining Monero for around 8 months however have recently switched over to mining ZCash, so am relatively unversed on the scene. 


With that being said, since mining Monero I have overlocked my cards to a ""sweet spot"" of hash rate, stability and temperature, however noticed my Sol/s was fairly low, so removed all of the overlocks. Since doing so, the cards are mining at a much higher Sol/s.



Could anyone advise on what the reason for this is? It seems odd that a lower clock speed is yielding considerably higher Sol/s.



Note: Just to address the obvious, the cards were stable at my overclock and were not running excessively hot (60 celsius).

(I hope this is not a noob question)  

I sent 0.3262605 ZEC from my bit-z account to my Wallet and then again 0.56630578 ZEC from my binance account to my wallet (my wallet address: t1JnnDSP6GVH4FBCXjhj2eCVzjWAZ5vmF84) ...now observe the weird thing:
https://zcashnetwork.info/address/t1JnnDSP6GVH4FBCXjhj2eCVzjWAZ5vmF84  


The 3rd and 4th transactions show that I received the exact amount of 0.3262605 ZEC and 0.56630578 ZEC so NO PROBLEM YET.  
 But then the first two transactions show that I SENT 0.3262605 and 0.56630578 ZEC FROM MY WALLET(not my exchange) to an unknown address: t1Y33iLHRqQB8aZrxkSNQ4P7coFqVPDN62W !  


The thing is I don't see any withdrawal with the mentioned amount of ZEC in my wallet I see them only on my deposit list! IDK how the hell I sent 0.3262605 and 0.56630578 ZEC to t1Y33iLHRqQB8aZrxkSNQ4P7coFqVPDN62W if I can't see it on my withdrawal list in my wallet?  


NOTE: I checked further and found out that this glitch(if I can call it a glitch) happened before twice.  
I also  experienced double spending before: https://www.reddit.com/r/BinanceExchange/comments/7w3bjn/weird_my_account_got_double_funded/

The Privacy Coin Matrix project is a cross-team collaboration to create a comprehensive comparison matrix that can be referenced by everyone.

B.https://youtu.be/oxuRxtrO2Ag

5. Once you have set up Ubuntu with the guide and familiarized yourself with the operating system, watch this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ahQZZYcntQ and follow the instructions in it to install zcash on Ubuntu via command line as normal. You can also use this guide for more install instruction commands: https://z.cash/download.html

# What's Next?

Geeze dude! We just released version 8.0! Give us a break!

Just kidding!

If you've been an active member in our community, you know that the work never stops! We're constantly rolling out new updates and features to AIOMiner to bring a better and more successful mining experience to our users. So, next thing we're working on is further development of AIOMiner.com. We want the website to complement and integrate with the AIOMiner software. This way you'll be able to monitor any and all of your rigs anywhere you have an internet connection! 

We're also going to be working on deep analytics into your rig(s) so that you can manipulate them yourself to align with your mining goals whether that be profit, coin accumulation, simply supporting the projects that you believe in, or anything else mining related.

Something already in the works and getting very close to launch is the AIOPool, but that's all I'm going to say about that! You'll have to stay tuned for more! (Sign up for our newsletter on the website)

# Help Wanted

All this time, we've been a small team of miners making a better mining experience. As we grow, we're going to need more help! If you're interested in working on a project like AIOMiner, come by our discord and let us know! We'll be happy to evaluate your credentials and see if there's a need on our team that you can fill!

I am trying to use zcash4win, but the blockchain has been stuck at 87.4% for about 2 days now. Whenever I try and uninstall it and re install it it just stays at 87.4%. Any idea on how to restart the blockchain installation? 
Also, I sent money to it, is there any way to get the zcash off of it without using the blockchain?
Thanks

Shielded transactions take up only 5% of all transactions. And only 0.3% of transactions are fully shielded. It's very hard to argue we are a privacy coin when so few of our transactions are private.  This plays into...

2. Shielded transactions are REALLY hard to do. They require a full node and over ~~4gb~~  1.7gb of memory. Of course this will be fixed with the sapling update, but until then ZEC is just bitcoin.

3. Flypool has over 51% hashing rate. This means that flypool has the power to undermine the block chain. (Not break privacy, but do double spends)

Now, ways I think we can fix this issue.

1. Sapling update will fix the lack of shielding I believe, but that is months away and lots of things need to happen, including finishing the powers of Tau ceremony. Until then, we need some other way to do shielded transactions, perhaps some type of remote/cloud signing service with a mobile app.

2. We need a better competitor to flypool. Sadly, flypool is really easy to use and setup. Perhaps a pool can gain momentum by being the first pool that does payouts to z address.

But what I want to know is how would I go about ""importing"" or opening this backup from a completely different computer if something happens to my main one?  

What's the use of the private key of the main address?

If I keep mining, and I get more zec to my current wallet, but my latest backup doesn't have these funds, will I lose the most recently mined zec if I import it?

to sum it up: I am fucked up! I have my ZEC in my wallet zcash4mac in a z address.
Now I wanted to move them to my ledger and first step was to send my funds from the z address to my t address in my zcash4mac wallet.

The problem is, sending is not at all possible! I always get this error message: 
""An error occured when sending cash. Error message is:

I tried it multiple times. Varied the sum that I was trying to send.
I did a -rescan and -reindex command in the terminal.
After synchronizing the whole blockchain (like 2 days) I get the same error message.

Can anyone give me a hint what else I could try?
I am really desperate and afraid that the whole ZECs are lost...

Does anybody habe similar issues with the mac application?
I am not aware how to vary the parameters since I am using the GUI.

&amp;nbsp;
 
**Problem:**
  Every time when there are big fluctuations in the Coin Market Cap, most of the coins are going UP or DOWN in the same way. Be informed and act accordingly (for example, when it goes DOWN: you can move into other stable currencies or withdraw; etc.).
  
  NEW: See fluctuations of some currencies too (8 till now).

&amp;nbsp;

**Recommendation:**
  I recommend you the **CMC Alert** app, as it gives you the information that you need regarding the Coin Market Cap in a user friendly way, it's simple, efficient and FREE. CMC Alert uses the official Web API from coinmarketcap.com.
*Why should you use it:*
 
+ It's a hidden notification, only way to see it is if you drag your notification tab down, you don't even know it's there

- It's a lot faster than going on coinmarketcap.com.
 
- Can **Set Alarms** and **Aggressive Alarm mode**(optional) - perfect when you want to be awake during nights
 
* It's free and requires no permissions so it's safe.

- Can view prices in BTC/USD/EURO.

- NEW: Notifications for some crypto currencies too !!

I am posting something to warn others about one of the wallets they reccommend. 

Basically, mymonero.com is the web wallet recommended by Monero on the subreddit and by the devs and on getmonero.org If I am understanding the developer of Monero helps manage that site, it's similar to myetherwallet. 

First off, there are many threads (and have some have been deleted) of users complaining of funds being stolen from their mymonero.com I have looked at these accounts and they're not new accounts by any means. So doesn't seem like a reason to spread fud around. 

The users literally have no answers, saying the people claiming this must of been ratted/keylogged/downloaded a malicious link. There were many problems late 2017/early 2018 of reported thefts out of nowhere. 

The problem is that no one seems to have an answer to this, the community members were quick to blame the posters. I can't remember the exact quote but on one of the threads one of the members claims that the devs know something may be wrong with it, and have addressed it before, but yet still advertise it on their subreddit and on getmonero.org 

There is something sketchy about that site, i personally know somoene who had 2 XMR on mymonero.com that disappeared, and he's definitely not dumb enough to download anything/get ratted. 

There is something obviously wrong with the site/do not use it under any circumstance. You can go to the monero subreddit and see all the posts and how no one really has any answers.

Miner is offline and I can't change that settings because I cant confirm it with my IP adress

what can I do?

For example ethermine has this policy
If your unpaid balance is greater than 0.01 ETH and you have not received a payout from the pool during the last 7 days your account will be paid out during the next payout round, usually after 5 - 10 minutes, independent of your configured payout threshold

Does flypool have same thing? I did not find that.

[**Edward Snowden leaked documents showing the NSA had mass-surveillance programs on almost every individual in the United States**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden), and that was **5 years ago**. What is the government doing today?

Over the past 40 hours or so, the Suprnova ZEC pool has been acting significantly strange. 

Yesterday, there were no blocks found at all for like 12 hours from noon EST to 12 am. Then a block was found around midnight (EST), and both my rigs went offline and I couldn’t connect. DSTM gave error ""timeout sinit"" for quite a while. For like two hours I couldn’t connect.

Then I could finally connect again around 2:30 to 3 am, but no hash rate was reported on the dashboard. The pool hashrate was acting strange as well.

It’s been 40 hours since this started and Suprnova has only found 3 blocks in that time.... when they average 11-13 a day. And then I checked out their block information and saw that the last three blocks found had identical actual share rates. This is not only highly unlikely. It’s statistically almost impossible...right? For three blocks found over the course of 40 hours to have identical shares....?!!

Something is wrong, but I don’t know that anyone knows. And I’m not sure if I think it’s intentional, a DDOS, or just buggy....

Anyone?","","833zxu",NA,0,NA,"false",1522277544,"false","self","t5_3g2bq","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/zec/comments/833zxu/something_strange_going_on_with_suprnova_zec_pool/","","",NA,"","",0,0

The folks at Zcash are some truly bright individuals and have the capability to bring true privacy to the entire crypt0 space. As Snowden said, we need to stop fighting and come together. In times like these, when banks are more than ever under threat by us..we need to focus on the tools we have. The more blockchains that adopt Zcash's ZSL (Zero Knowledge Security Layer) the more valuable this tech will be in the future. I only see that happening more and more in the coming months/ years as the need for cutting edge privacy increases on a global scale. 

Here is a quote from the blog link below :

 ""ZSL can be layered on top of any distributed ledger solution, adding support for shielded transactions to the underlying ledger’s featureset. However, it does not automatically follow that all of the underlying ledger’s functionality will benefit from the added privacy and confidentiality. For example, integrating ZSL with the Ethereum codebase would make it possible to use shielded transactions to protect users’ privacy, but smart contracts would still need to be executed transparently. We are still in the early stages of researching how programmability can be implemented within ZSL in an efficient manner.

ZSL can also be integrated with any consensus mechanism; instead of proof of work, an enterprise ledger could use round-robin, proof of stake, or new consensus mechanisms like Tendermint. It could even be integrated into a MySQL database, where a schema plugin requires valid proofs for table inserts but the database administrator cannot see account balances.""

This is just my concern. I DO want Zec to become huge and i believe we can, but i think we need to become more widely used and accepted. I am NOT trying to hate on Zec. In fact i love, but just like how you sometimes need to change a child's behavior before it gets out of hand. I want Zec to become much bigger than it currently is. It has such a bright future, but i believe that until it is as widely accepted as Btc or we have some sort of Bitpay card for Zec it will be difficult to have the huge growth all of us hodling are looking foward to.

It concerns me that atleast from my research there does not seem to be many places we can use zec. Yes we can use it to buy mining equipment on that one website, but if you want to buy a movie ticket you have to at the minimum convert and even though fees are small you still lose tiny amounts of money.

It concerns me, because of how the outside world may see it. If they look st Zec and say hey this cannot be used many places, it has privacy which is a plus, but its extremly confusing, fees are low, but you have to change from one Crypto into another at the least... then why would i use Zec instead of another similar currency that is more accepted (Although if i am not mistsking we are the top crypto with privacy featues let me know if i am wrong) those privacy features are a big reason i use Zec, but once i have it i hodl, but what if i want to use it. I get a list of a few shady websites selling things that are useless to me.

Thank you for reading this and agian this is just my thoughts and i would love to hear yours ESPECIALLY if you can give me a reason on why this does not matter or how widely used we currently are. It would honestly give me so much hope. Much more than i already have. Agian i am NOT hating on Zec i actually love it, and it is for that reason i wrote this and voiced my concern, because i cannot make it as widely accepted as i would like but we can

I have been mining with my gaming pc for a few months now and i have around 1 zec at this point. The thing is that the zcash4win wallet have stopped working a couple of months now ( Daemon is taking longer than expected... )

I have read here that you can delete a few files at the zcash folder and the wallet will finally get to open, sync all the blockchain from the beginning and lets you use your funds. I have done so last week and it worked.

Had to turn off my pc for a moment yesterday and when i opened it again i got the same error message. I tried again the solution but this time the blockchains fails to get synced to 100%, it stopped at around 90%. I tried again and the same thing happened, at exactly the same date of blockchain syncing the error appeared.

At this point i am frustrated, i just want for the damn thing to open properly and transfer my fund to another wallet or convert them to a coin that has a working wallet. 

What else can i do? Some people mentioned about adding some lines to a text file or something, can anyone give a noob-friendly guide of doing that?

 **What happened:**

David Mercer the developer who worked on zcash4win and zcash4mac has decided stop allowing downloads of these (which are stuck on old versions) so it doesn't confuse new users since they not up-to-date. David is not part of Zcash Company and his software is open source. The only ""Official"" Zcash software is the Linux version.

**Why** 

Rather than continue to update the zcash4win and zcash4mac code he has decided to create new wallet/node software from the ground up so it will be a better codebase/GUI and easier to update for the future. The new version will be called ""winzec"" and available at winzec.com when it is done.

**What does this mean for zcash4win and zcash4mac users?**

If you are _currently_ running zcash4win or zcash4mac you don't need to do anything. The zcash4win and zcash4mac are just not available to download, they will continue to work until the Hard Fork expected in a few months. 

**Are the funds I have in zcash4win or zcash4mac lost?**

No, remember the way all Blockchains like Zcash and Bitcoin work is that coins are on the Blockchain _at all times_. Your wallet has the Public and Private keys that allow you to spend from the addresses you control.

**Help my wallet won't start!**

Since the zcash4win version is version 1.0.12 (and the latest version is 1.0.15) you need to add `disabledeprecation=1.0.12` to the configuration file as explained in this thread: https://forum.z.cash/t/required-config-change-for-zcash4win-1-0-12/26632

There is a Video of how to do this Here: https://youtu.be/VT06Nh6TTzw

This will keep the node from auto-depreciation and allow you to still use it until a the new version comes out or the Hard Fork when you will need to switch wallets.

If you do the above steps and it still won't sync you may have to reindex your chain: 

Open a Command window and try:

C:\Program Files\zcash4win\app\zcashd.exe -reindex -daemon=0 

NOTE: The above line is just an example and will need to be tweaked depending on your computers users/app location/etc..

If you are not familiar with how to run something from a Command line please see this tutorial: https://m.wikihow.com/Run-a-Program-on-Command-Prompt

**What if I want to switch wallets?**

To switch wallets you first need to determine if you want to use or have funds in a _private address_.

If you _don't have funds_ in a private address and _don't want to use private addresses_ then you can transfer your funds to many other wallets like Jaxx or a hardware wallet like a Ledger Nano.

I have a list of wallets here: https://www.zcashcommunity.com/wallets/

If you _do have funds_ in a private address and don't want to send them to a transparent address read on:  

**Step 1** is setting up a new full node. You can install the Zcash Official Linux Client via this guide: https://github.com/zcash/zcash/wiki/1.0-User-Guide

There are several Videos on how install Zcash on Linux here: 

https://youtu.be/5ahQZZYcntQ
https://youtu.be/9-P7IHC7d-o
https://youtu.be/noiPWhPT6sk

I have an _very old_ written step-by-step tutorial about how to set up a VM and install Linux &amp; Zcash here: https://minezcash.com/how-to-mine-zcash-part1/ (just ignore the last ""mining steps)

**Step 2** Is once you have a new Node running you have two choices: You can generate a new address to send the funds to the new wallet _or_ transfer the wallet.dat file to the new node. 

Instructions to get a backup of your wallet from zcash4win are here:

https://youtu.be/JGtpUnHTf2w

You can use that wallet.dat to restore your funds to _any full node wallet_ Linux Windows or Mac.

The best part about running a the official client is that you can update as soon as an update is available directly from the Zcash developers! No more waiting for third party developers to push an update.

While you are here, take a second to backup your wallet.dat file to somewhere safe, preferably offline or on a separate computer/USB so in case of disaster you won't lose everything.

I see so many threads on here regarding profitability in regards to mining with different gpu's, but very few posts about mining with respect to securing the network. This worries me as a potential investor because i'm worried that if mining Zcash continues to decrease in profitability, or if other coins become noticeably more profitable for mining, the Zcash network will suffer dramatically. Wondering if the team is doing anything to help promote significant growth within the community, and whether or not anyone else on this subreddit has found this to be an issue other then me.

I just hope ZCash leads the path of Bitcoin Cash so it's simple, cheap and fast. Also kudos for not entering the fight against ASICs.

I'm a hobbyist developer and I use linux, I've been able to install and use ZCash but I have to say it's literally impossible to use for a person whose expertise has nothing to do with computers. I like the fact that ZCash is focused on the underlying technique but I tend to be more a business oriented person and I consider the network effect crucial for the success of a cryptocurrency. In fact that's the reason I liked Monero as they are gaining real world traction but still they are leading the project in a direction I am not comfortable with—*RingCT are weak, transitions are very expensive and their ad-hoc proof of work change is a complete disaster and a misinterpretation of free markets and proof of work in itself*.

Since ZEC collects a big fee I'd really like them to dedicate their resources towards making Zcash simple to use. A simple cross-platform wallet that allows you to send shielded and transparent transactions and see your balance. There are third party wallets but non support z addresses.

I still remember how the 'WhatsApp' application took over the rest even thought it was technically simple and had other more sophisticated alternatives. Zcash is good enough so it needs to be used **now**. If you don't have adoption you have nothing more than useless immutable private bits.

What makes NANEX (https://nanex.co/) unique is that all pairs are traded against NANO which offers no fees/instant txns for deposits and withdrawals. The security is top notch (2FA), the CEO is very responsive (reddit/discord), and the trading volume is growing rapidly ($1.4m). BTCP was recently listed, increasing its exposure to the greater community, and I think ZEC would be a natural fit alongside major coins like BTC/LTC/ETH which are already trading here.

It does require the ZEC team to apply for a listing which is why I am linking this here: https://support.nanex.co/hc/en-us/articles/360003199533-What-is-required-for-an-asset-to-be-listed-on-Nanex-

As far as I can understand, one of the biggest downsides is the computing power and time required to create a shielded transaction, averaging about 40seconds to generate a transaction. For a commercial application on a large scale, this seems unsustainable, especially if you compare it to the concept of creating private channels for transactions between specific parties.

I'm also curious about the regulation implications. ZKPs are often touted as a solution to the problem of financial services requiring some level of data privacy for transactions while still trying to take advantage of the network effect of blockchain tech. But from a regulators perspective, how does this play out? If a company or organization is being audited, is it entirely within their control what transactions they will allow a regulator to see? Consider a private, commercial implementation of the technology that would shield transactions from participants not directly involved in said transactions - is there a way to provide a sort of ""god view"" to an organization responsible for overseeing these organizations (think the FCC and banks)?

TLDR: What are the regulatory implications of commercial implementations of zero-knowledge proof protocols? Performance implications? Comparison to channels?","false","8dpuov",NA,0,NA,"false",1529619285,"false","self","t5_3g2bq","false","",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/zec/comments/8dpuov/downsides_of_zero_knowledge_proofs/","t3_8dpuov",NA,NA,"","",0,0

This should show up in a network difficulty chart as a drop in hashrate as people begin to switch. Examining the Monero difficultly chart from a few months ago shows a very similar story to the Zcash difficulty increase. There was a exponential increase in hashrate on both the networks leading me to believe there are indeed ASICs already mining Zcash. I know there is a lot of controversy over if Zcash should fork or not but it is my belief that Zcash should fork to stay ASIC resistant. I believe keeping it ASIC resistant would be beneficial to the community as the coin would remain relatively easy to begin mining as there wouldn't be a need for expensive ASIC miners. I know when I first started mining, if the difficulty/profitability was at this current state I wouldn't be mining Zcash today. This shouldn't be seen as a rant, just a few thoughts. Leave your thoughts below. I'm interested to see everyone elses thoughts/opinions. Do you guys believe ASICs are already mining away on Zcash?

Here are two links that can be used to observe the difficulty.

https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/monero-difficulty.html#6m

https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/zcash-difficulty.html

Edit:

Observing the monero hashrate chart does confirm that many people are switching to mining monero. This can be seen as the upward spike from the low point from yesterday.

https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/hashrate-xmr.html#3m

Likewise a downward spike, while not as noticeable as the Monero spike, is shown on the hashrate charts for Zcash. While this could be a coincidence I believe it isn't due to the dip starting 3 days ago. This would be right around the time of the fork if I am correct. As other people begin to realize the profitability for Monero they may soon switch to try to snag as much Monero as possible while the network hashrate is still low. 

Zcash Chart if needed: 
https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/zcash-hashrate.html#3m

Edit after 2 days of initial:

Since the Monero fork the network hashrate has dropped on Zcash by around 38.6 million according to the chart I previously talked about. While this isnt much compared to the overall network hashrate it is still a very noticeable decrease. We have yet to see network hashrates this low since as far back as February of this year. As more and more people begin to see the profitability and switch to Monero the amount that it is more profitable by will decrease significantly as Monero may be loaded with new miners. This decrease in difficulty for Zcash may make Zcash more profitable than its current state as it will be easier to mine. I still stand by my statement that we should still fork and many good comments were brought up such as the fact that they slowly and secretly put up the ASICs on cryptonight making the hashrate climb more gradual and go unnoticed and I believe this is the current state that Zcash is in now. Keeping Zcash ASIC resistant, in my opinion, allows for much more flexibility for miners. Also, introducing ASICs may alienate those who cannot afford or obtain ASICs creating a more centralized coin. This does not leave much room for new miners or for small investors to get into mining keeping the coin from growing. Again, Id like to hear your thoughts and opinions below. I'll try to address each comment in a constructive way.","false","8ayo0u",NA,0,NA,"false",1529569452,"false","self","t5_3g2bq","false","",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/zec/comments/8ayo0u/will_we_see_a_fall_in_network_hashrate/","t3_8ayo0u",NA,NA,"","",0,0

I have 10 Zotac 1080 TI Extreme GPUs, running on windows 10, 64 bit. Windows updates &amp; Nvidia drivers are all the latest
I have 3 GPUs out of the 7, which start hashing at 750 Sol, but after few minutes they drop all the way down to ~300 or even ~250
I have tried different power risers, different PSUs, different PCIe slots, nothing has helped
The same 3 GPUs will always start at 750 and go down to ~300
The same 7 GPUs will start at 750 and stay at the same level, no matter how i swap the PSUs, powered risers, slots, sockets, etc...
The display is connected directly to the motherboard not to any GPU
All GPUs has power state of P2, so i dont believe that one will do 750 and the other 250 because of this
I tried different miners, but the two showed absolutely the same result. 3 GPUs badly perform and 7 perform very well
I noticed that ""memory controller load"" on the high performing GPUs is about 80% while on the badly performing GPUs is around 55%, using Hardware Info software
Is this the root cause?
Any idea how can i fix this?

Edit: 13-April , I found the solution and i am sharing it with the community
As you can see nothing has helped
reinstalling windows, changing miners, wires, PSUs, PCIe slots, MB updates, DDU drivers and reinstall latest, you name it...
The problem turned out to be that those 3 GPUs throttle at 67 degrees C, which is quite strange. The only assumption that i have is that such config is in their BIOS. I have tried different software like MSI AB, nothing has helped. The soonest they reach a temp of 67 C, the ""memory controller load"" drops from ~80% to ~50% then the hashrate drops from 750 Sol to 250 Sol
I did not dare to manipulated an encrypted BIOS, so i just reduced the power limit from 100% to 70% and set the fan manually on 55%. this way i keep the temp between 55 to 65 without hitting the 67 limit that those GPUs have.
I hope you find this helpful!","false","8bq74s",NA,0,NA,"false",1529583161,"false","self","t5_3g2bq","false","",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/zec/comments/8bq74s/gpu_hashrate_drops_from_750_to_300_suddenly/","t3_8bq74s",NA,NA,"","",0,0

He told us briefly about his vision for  Zcash and why it is much more than what meets the eyes. I must say, we were thrilled. 

One thing that we all can agree is that in a country with 1.2 billion people, we certainly need a payment system like that of Zcash and I am sure that it is the same narrative for every other country. 

This time around we (CoinSwitch) had a plan in mind . We want to educate the Indian crowd about Zcash. We wanted to do this despite the fact that we are a global exchange and most of our traffic comes from Europe and America but we are based out of India so we were sure we could do a good job.. Most people in India who trade cryptocurrencies are more bothered about the price but someone’s gotta tell them that Zcash is not just about trading. We got in talks with Zooko and Josh (Zcash’s marketing director) on how we could let more people know about Zcash. At this point, it is important to mention that there is just one exchange out of a dozen present in India that offers Zcash for Fiat and maybe that is why most people in India haven’t heard of Zcash.

We at CoinSwitch are determined to increase the awareness level of Zcash in India. We will work closely with Zooko and Josh in building a community and sending out relevant content. I hope in coming months, we succeed in reaching where we aimed to reach.
Here is an image of us with the man himself: https://twitter.com/coinswitch/status/978941456978206720

I moved to Winzec recently - migrating from zcash4win went smoothly. I had no issue with WinZEC for about a week but I noticed today that I am getting the Daemon error - https://imgur.com/a/7IgIT

Anyone having the same issue and any luck resolving it? Back in the zcash4win days we would disable deprecation.

Do I need to add the same disabledeprecation command to a winzec config file?

Regardless, Zcash has been backed by Edward Snowden and Vitalik Buterin and recently accepted as a coin to be placed on Gemeni, which might mean Coinbase soon too. Charlie Lee says he does not own Zcash and that he owns Monero. 

Is this currency planning for second layer solutions. Will it actually be decentralized \(it certainly is not right now\) and how is it's coin supply from an investment now and utility later standpoint.

Talk me into Zcash. Tell me things I do not know. Explain why you agree it is better than Monero and has a better long term future, etc... Anything helps. I want to become a believer. 

Is Zcash essentially an XRP type of situation where a company created a currency that's ""decentralized"" and its utility case is to be used as a central manner for privacy transactions for businesses because it is from a centralized and registered company?

First, please do not post comments that I should not have used Freewallet. I think that's pretty obvious now. It was a huge mistake but that doesn't make what they're doing any less criminal.

I suffer from cancer, which Ive told them already, but the Freewallet scam keeps on rolling. NO honest company has the HUNDREDS of scam complaints that these thieves at [**u/freewallet\_support**](https://www.reddit.com/user/freewallet_support/) do. Look up their previous posts to me.

For no valid reason, Freewallet began blocking customer access to their funds recently. Every ridiculous, phony excuse has been made, none of them true.

After absolutely assuring I would have access to my crypto after a simple ID submission, Freewallet instead obstructed my access by making an absurd claim that my ID photos had been edited. That is exactly the tactic I expected from this criminal organization. As I proved to them via video, all of my photos were 100&amp;#37; legitimate, completely unedited. On top of that, EVERY other crypto exchange that Ive submitted my ID to has NEVER even questioned it. WHY? Because the other exchanges are not scams like [**u/freewallet\_support**](https://www.reddit.com/user/freewallet_support/) is. Again, just look at the massive number of complaints. Search them. It speaks for itself.

Their tactic is beyond predictable for a scam. When they see they've encountered their worst nightmare, meaning me in this case, they begin resolving a few complaints here and there to make it look like they're trying to do right. All of those, however, are peanuts compared to my life savings. They would rather risk their necks than let that go back to its rightful owner. That's what lowlife scammers like Freewallet do.

Theyre so careless at Freewallet, that they never thought to consider Reddit posts CANNOT be deleted. This is NOT Facebook, where they delete customer complaints ALL the time.

Nothing matters to them but stealing my life savings. I have my life savings in there. I have given them EXACTLY what they asked for, and I still have NO access to my crypto.

My emails to them are now also with the US Attorney, who is the most prolific cyber crimes prosecutor on earth. They have already stated to my personal lawyer that a company who refuses to provide their own identities and location cannot lawfully ask customers for theirs. The USA's office labeled Freewallet ""an obvious scam"" in a call with my lawyer. Im a US customer, so Freewallet must abide by US law. The US has extradited many cyber criminals who have never even set foot in the US before, just because they stole from a US customer. They have that kind of extreme influence worldwide.

At this point my cancer symptoms have grown worse due to the stress Freewallet has caused me. I can barely breathe at times. However, I certainly expect to be here long enough to have them prosecuted, via the US Attorney, and their partner, Interpol.

Perhaps their biggest problem though, is I now know who their biggest figure is, whose operation is funded by stolen Freewallet funds like mine, and until my crypto is released to me, he can expect his life to be a nightmare.

You stole from the wrong cancer patient Freewallet... and now you're going to pay","false","8iyfl2",NA,0,NA,"false",1529714037,"false","self","t5_3g2bq","false","",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/zec/comments/8iyfl2/freewallet_stole_cancer_patients_life_savings_id/","t3_8iyfl2",NA,NA,"","",0,0

Innosilicon also starts shipping Sia miner S11 3830 GH/s, 1380W $3500 vs Bitmain Antminer A3 815 GH/s, 1275W $520. 


This thing could be real since Z9 mini only uses 300W. A full miner will be super expensive, but extremely powerful and efficient.


My thoughts on Zcash ASIC:


Stage 1: Bitmain learned something from Monero fork, so they intentionally keeps the hashrate low by releasing low power miner.


Stage 2: People think they are efficient and not overpowered enough to centralize hashing. No harsh response from the ETH and Zcash community. 


Stage 3: GPU miners start buying $2000 10K/300W mini ASIC. GPU hashing slowly moved to other coins.


Stage 4: 4 months later. A powerful and more efficient 80K/1300W Full ASIC released at $7000. Miners dumping mini ASIC and buying new ASIC.


Stage 5: Bitmain builds a super farm takes over 30% hashrate. Small miners see their earning drops so they are either buying more ASICs to maintain the income level until they don't have enough power.

Recently, however I've noticed that my Sol/s drops down to 80 when I'm not near the pc.  when I come back to the pc and start doing something, it goes back up.  It's strange.  There's no dip in gaming performance \(I exit the miner when I game on the pc\) but I have been getting the occasional fatal Direct X error.  I had the card OC'd about 200mhz each for clock and memory and the power limit set to 101, but I reverted it back to default and it's still doing it.  Does anyone have a clue as to what my issue is?

It also has a playful design and advanced features! Feedback?","Hi!

There are a ton of great websites that provide a number of analytical data and info on cryptocurrencies. These are great, but it's easy to feel overwhelmed and confused while getting started in the space.

This is why my cousin and I launched [https://coin\-deck.com](https://coin-deck.com/) It's a mobile friendly, easy to navigate crypto index with a playing cards format. It focuses on discovering and tracking cryptocurrencies through the use of filters and sort options.

Currently, the websites lets you search cryptocurrencies based on market cap, price, age, industry, ratings and types. You can then filter the results through various options such as 24h gains, 24 volume or ATH traceback.

You can also add coins to your watchlist and add the ones you hold to your portfolio ""deck"" to track your earnings.

More features and filters will be added as we go along.

We'd love to hear your feedback!

First, they limited the order at one Z9 machine per buyer, but as of yesterday:


    To ensure that more individual buyers can purchase miners in this batch, we have set a limit of 50 miner per user.


But yeah, I don't see how this could cause centralization, lol /s


This is the response of the ZCash foundation if you're interested: https://z.cash.foundation/blog/statement-on-asics/


Basically, they will waste as much time as possible doing research, this is my favorite quote:


    Sometimes miner manufacturer claims are hot air. What if the efficiency gains are minimal compared to new GPUs? Would it be worth engaging in a potentially contentious fork, or splitting the community, if GPUs were still competitive?


Are you kidding, lol? Bitmain has never underperformed, usually the miner hashes even like 5% more than they claim. Anyway, it's obvious that by late 2018 ASICs will dominate the network and this debate of theirs will pretty much be forgotten, as GPU miners will move to other coins and not touch ZEC any more.


And this is why I love XMR, the coin has a promise of ASIC resistance and as soon as the threat was real, action was taken to honor that promise with the support from the community. A coin needs a serious and proactive team which is ready to tackle difficulties and challenges as it progresses and remain determinant in the values that the coin promises.

The thought being,  all those X3s are mining something other than monero  - so what?

My criteria were,  cryptonight algo and traded on polo.   The list was short,  exactly one coin - Bytecoin.  The diff had risen 8x over the past month and the price had not risen proportionally, this made the decision easy.   Bought a not- insignificant quantity of them around 60 sats and expected to hold for a while until the expected price increase to move more inline with the diff. 

Today,  you probably heard what happened on binance with a 32x rise in price.  This was ""made possible"" by no blocks being mined for at least two hours.  This jogged my memory on something that happened a couple years back that I'd forgotten all about.  This also caused me to reasses my stance on the Z3 and whether it is good or bad for ZCash.

Leading up to the latest bitcoin halving , I was researching SHA256 coins to speculate on.   At the time, I figured a lot of the SHA ASICs would move off of bitcoin and into alts after the halving took place.  At the time I was trading on both polo and trex, so I wanted coins on both platforms.   There were about three coins I settled on as I remember - DGB, Myriad, and CURE.  Bought some of each on both exchanges. 

A similar scenario unfolded with CURE as happened with BCN today  There was a massive,  MASSIVE, pump of CURE on Polo but price was mostly unchanged on trex.  Sold my CURE on polo and initiated a transfer from trex to polo to sell the remainder.  After some time, there were zero confirmations showing on trex.  WTF?  Searched out a block explorer for CURE and low and behold the chain was not moving.  After some time,  the pump was over and the chain began moving again. 

There was certainly a nefarious actor on the mining side that had stalled the chain.   I'm no expert on the technicals of how, but winning shares were being withheld by someone with a significant portion of that network's hashrate.  Maybe someone else can chime in with the details on how this type of attack is perpetrated.  Incidentally,  CURE was delisted from polo a very short time later. Whether this was due to polo calling BS, or being complicit and tipping off somebody prior to the delisting announcement to get one last hoorah, the world will never know. 

I also remember some talk around that time of excessive orphans happening on slushpool.  It apparently ended up being an unintentional issue wherein one of the larger farms pointed at slush was withholding winning shares.  This sounded very similar to what happened with CURE, but with so much more hashrate on the BTC network, others were finding winning shares to keep the chain moving. 

So, how is this relevant to ZEC?  

I believe the BCN attack was made possible by,  and initiated with,  Antminer X3s.  Somebody has a lot of them and pulled this off. 

I believe the CURE attack was perpetrated by a major holder of SHA256 ASICs.  The CURE nethash was a drop in the bucket compared to bitcoin so it was probably a simple matter of pulling off BTC for a couple hours,  attacking CURE, then returning to BTC (or whatever else they were moving at the time).

Not going to speculate on who waged these attacks, it's irrelevant.   The important, common, factor is ASIC miners.  I fear that the ZEC network will be vulnerable to this type of attack should action not be taken to resist ASICs.  All it would take is two hours to completely trash it's reputation and the effort invested in getting it to where it is today.  

Before you call me a GPU shill or ASIC fudder, consider that these things have actually happened and do your own research to refute the points being made.  In either case,  thank you for taking the time to read what I've written and I look forward to your feedback.

https://www.coindesk.com/overwinter-ahead-happen-zcashs-first-hard-fork-hits/

The Hard Fork will activate at block height 347,500 and Nodes not running compatible software 1.1.0 or later will automatically enter safe mode approximately 1hr before the Fork. **This includes older versions of Zcash4win and Zcash4mac.** https://forum.z.cash/t/alerts-for-nodes-in-support-of-upcoming-overwinter-upgrade/29831

To avoid a Node shutdown make sure you are running the latest version of the Zcash software: https://z.cash/download.html

If you are running Zcash4win you should update to WinZEC as soon as possible: http://winzec.com

If you are running Zcash4mac you should move to the up-to-date version of Zcash-apple: https://github.com/kozyilmaz/zcash-apple

I think those criticisms are mostly irrelevant, but there is a point to them, and not much loss from a diversity of cryptocurrencies trying a bunch of different strategies. It doesn't seem possible to eliminate the trusted setup in the short term, given that other zero-knowledge schemes are even less usable than ZK-snarks (maybe Ben-Sassoon and Chiesa's Starkware will save us all). But the other popular criticisms may very well be addressed by a post-Sapling fork, given the efficiency gains. The fork would have mandatory-privacy (transparent addresses are unusable), decentralized Monero-style governance instead of the Zcash company-foundation model, no founders' tax or premine and a commitment to ASIC resistance . Do you guys see any hope in a project of this style? Do you think it would be better for Zcash and the crypto space, or do you think it's best if we wait 4 years until no more founders' reward, enough efficiency that Zcash will deprecate t-addresses naturally (as the devs wish to), transition into trustless setup, and keep the worldclass dev team?

I think a fork might actually force the Zcash devs to prioritize mandatory privacy and suffer the consequences of the efficiency trade-off that comes with that, and the other concerns aren't that important.

The only thing I haven't been able to address in the post, is how to get better hashrates with the current software. In the tutorial I use NHeqminer release 0.5c\-v7. If you go to the github downloads [https://github.com/kozyilmaz/nheqminer\-macos/releases](https://github.com/kozyilmaz/nheqminer-macos/releases), it shows they have a v11 pre\-release that you would have to build from source. I'd like to add an update to my article that demonstrates a good way to maximize hashrates on mac OS. I'm wondering if using the v11 pre\-release and compiling it from source (or even compiling the main release from source), would have any affect in terms of hashrates. Other that that, would anyone else have any tricks to speed up z\-cash mining hashrates on Mac OS? Thanks a bunch. Also, if you are looking for a way to mine Zcash on a Mac and don't know how, my tutorial should help quite a bit. Cheers!

Don't you think this is CLEARLY a move by the global elite to control the hashpower of our network, and 51&amp;#37; attack it out of existence? If not, surely it must be Bitmain using their devilish intentions to create these ASICs, mine with them, and then sell them to the public after they have made their profits, right? If so, why would I, a dedicated GPU democratizer, care if ASIC purchasers weren't getting a good deal? I'm not sure, but nevermind that, because we need a referendum so that my GPUs will be not only profitable, but so that ASIC hardware will not even be usable on this red, white, and blue network of ours.

If ASICs are allowed to mine equihash, I won't make as much money as I did before, and I think if that's the case I don't even want to run a node! What will happen to Zcash, the technology that emboldens fundamental human rights, and empowers them to be used across borders, if I, God's GPU miner, cannot make a nice profit? I'm not just going to stand by and support a positive technology because it's the right thing to do! It had founders after all, and if I support it and it helps the common man (in addition to increasing their ZEC price) then I'm just a puppet of the rich who acted altruistically instead of for profit! Who will respect me then?

Who's with me? Let's make GPUs great again! Comment with your **approval**!

It sounded pretty nice.

So I'd like to get started with my first cryptocurrency. I've read a lot in the past few hours, but since this is money I'm talking about I'd like to be very careful and cautious.

I think I understand how to buy ZEC with a wallet and something called ""Kraken"" to exchange fiat currency, which if I'm not wrong is just normal money, in to ZEC. What I'm having trouble understanding is how to purchase things with ZEC. The website I saw had a QR code. What do I do with that? Do I need it? My phone's camera is wrecked so I don't think i could scan it.

I am relatively new to the crypto space, and I was hoping to understand this a little more in depth.
Fungibility is clearly one of the most important aspects of any currency, and a bitcoin that is ""white-washed"" by the FBI being valued above another bitcoin presents a problem.  That is where the privacy of Zcash presents significant value.

My question is, is there any way to prevent Zcash used on the black market from being laundered through exchanges?  Someone could easily be validated through KYC while also using crypto on the black market.  If the history of the coin can't be tracked, like what Chainalysis does for Bitcoin, how can money laundering be prevented?  If the SEC can't prevent money laundering with Zcash, I don't see why they wouldn't eventually make the use of Zcash illegal in the United States.

Thank you in advance for your help!",NA,"8yqqtt",NA,0,NA,"false",1536600837,"false","self","t5_3g2bq","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/zec/comments/8yqqtt/zcash_privacy_vs_aml/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

What was discussed, was the politicians fears of losing control, taunting language to those who want to subvert that control, and various members of the intelligentsia praising the merits of cryptocurrency insofar as it can be utilized as a central bank tool. I think this is all fantastic, because other cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ripple, Stellar, and non-privacy-centric coins will always be at risk if a central bank entity was to begin issuing a currency, as they have nothing to offer that the central bank would not be willing to put into their coin.

It is highly unlikely, based on the rhetoric of those involved, that any central bank or government entity would want to issue a currency that has the privacy offered by Zcash, as they clearly projected how threatened they are by it. I think this is a huge win for Zcash, as even if central banks produce their own state-coins that are faster, more reputable, and more accessible for consumers, they will never be interested in offering private citizens Zero Knowledge technology; they only want the big boys to have that kind of freedom.

Just got rid of all of my ICX for some ZEC. I'm pretty nervous about this one since ICX seems primed to moon in the next bull run, but ZEC is simply the better coin so...

Let's get it! 

Is there any chance Zcash goes only anonymous in the future? Anonymous-only could give ZEC the advantage over XMR (which I also have) since the tech for ZEC privacy is great.

Been around crypto for a while, heard about ZEC from the beginning but only now starting to pay more attention due to these recent listings. From my perspective, I always thought of ZEC as a privacy coin, but putting it on G and CB seems almost counter-intuitive to that principle. Sure it is a great project with talented people, but there are others which we could say the same that are not enjoying the current on ramps with these big players in the crypto space. Is there some sort of bigger picture I'm not seeing here (possibly related to security tokens further down the road?) and the application that only the ZEC protocol offers in the long run? Your insight is appreciated, thanks!

Our main product is stainless steel tags engraved with seed words.  The user selects the desired words and receives custom engraved stainless steel tags and a method of his choosing to bind the tags together (nuts, bolts, chains, etc).

Is it safe to type the seed words on the website? **Absolutely not**. Typing your seed words anywhere that's connected to the internet opens you up to potential theft.

How is it possible then to still order seed words and stay safe?

* The chosen seed words are alphabetically sorted (so most likely scrambled).
* the user is encouraged to order his or her words in random.
* the user is encouraged to order way more ""words"" than needed.
* the user is encouraged to make several different partial orders, using different payment accounts, shipped to different physical addresses.

As an example, ordering 48 tags instead of 24 and choosing their order randomly, holds a close to 0 risk for the buyer. The chance for someone (us, the postal services, a trojan horse on your pc) figuring out your real seed words out of that is equivalent to winning the first prize in the Powerball lottery 4 times in a row, one week after another.

We show a few examples for the risk you take in various cases in our FAQ.

Best of all, we accept ZCash as payment, through an integration with Blockonomics+ShapeShift.

Although this may not be perfectly suited for this particular reddit crowd, early-crypto-adopters, diy-crowd, highly-tech-savvy folks that most of you are, we wanted to share this here (we're coming out with the website gradually to gauge feedback). It's a big world out there and many people [lose their funds](https://bitcoinist.com/estimated-4-million-bitcoin-lost-forever-by-users-forgetfulness/) because they don't have proper backups.

[ZCrash](http://zcrash.io/) is a social crash gambling site that was recently reopened after a long hiatus, it features the lovable crash game that everyone should remember by its predecessor Bustabit. 

The site uses the denominations ""Zooks"" 1,000,000 Zooks equals 1 ZCash, this conversion helps tremendously if you're looking to set up a script that requires a large amount of Zooks.

The site went under a large hiatus but it didn't come back the same, it came back with new and improved features that will definitely help out the average gambler, including the new buttons that allow you to change your bet size efficiently.

Even if you're not a avid chart game lover the site still has a wide variety of mini-games to play including

\-Coinflip

\-Lottery 

https://i.redd.it/h7o9hlqcvlb11.png

It even has a Rain-bot which is user-funded and gives away Zooks to active users in the chatroom 

https://i.redd.it/19m6jijbvlb11.png

Eventually there will be an Exchange-bot active ready to convert your ETH/BTC from your favorite crash sites on to [ZCrash](http://zcrash.io/).

The site has only been opened for 1 day and there are already users with thousands of zooks in profit.

**Why should you use ZCash and ZCrash?**

* Offers faster confirmations than its bitcoin equivalent
* Lower Transaction fees
* While the current version of bustabit has a static 1% house edge ZCrash offers a bonus which allows you to make the game more favorable for you.
* The max bet is currently set a 1 ZCash with a max profit of over 30 ZCash.

I know BTC is the market leader and will continue to dominate but privacy is somthing it as of yet cant do aswell . 
I dont like Monero mainly for its limited storage options, I bought some Xst Stealth as its a Tor privacy coin on ledger which seems unique , but the senses tell me that Zec is the coin to bet on . 
Also is it true Zec briefly trade at 2.2 million dollars before being publically released onto exchanges ? And why is Zclassic not better as it removes the founders reward , but does that stop innovation ?

*We are also seeing drastically more efficient Equihash ASICs being released every couple of months by the following three competitors: Innosilicon, Bitmain and ASICminer.*

**The ASICminer Zeon - 180ksol/s 2200W 47dB (**[**https://asicminer.co/shop**](https://asicminer.co/shop)**) should arrive in September and claims to be 4.5x more efficient than the upcoming Bitmain Antminer Z9!**

**At this rate, one can wonder if the Equihash ASIC race isn't going too fast and how hard this is going to hit our Community, Market and Foundation.**

In my opinion and on the short term, Equihash coins should either see the difficulty shooting up if miners decide to hodl a good chunk of their profits, or the price will keep going down if miners decide to cash out their profits.

Either way, a lot of power is in the hands of three ASICs manufacturers, and the way it's heading resembles a lot to Bitcoin's mining centralisation history...

**What are your thoughts?**

I cranked up the frequency to 650 for a couple days and then maxed it out at 750 until present day. It's been a mining beast and averages between 15k sol/s and 16k sol/s. I received 10 X Z9 minis today that are from the second batch supply. There's a couple differences I noticed compared to the first one I received. For starters these smell different and seemed to off gas quite a bit more than the miner I received in June. Which I guess can be a good thing if you're worried about them being mined with before shipped, and it's worth noting that they were all very clean. Some had the static bag taped shut while others were just folded over. My biggest concern though with these units I just received is that the highest stable over clocking I can find is 681. Any higher than 681 I lose one of the boards all together, or it displays that it's only mining at 1k sol/s. If anyone else is having a different experience from their first batch to their second batch please let me know.

Something else that was unexpected was the new tariff that was imposed on Chinese good coming into the U.S.. I had the first 2 of the second batch squeeze in before the new the tariff took effect and they were only $20 each, the other 8 miners were $220 to $240 each.

One of the main reasons is that crypto space is very risky and another reason is that most people don’t even know how to get started yet. Solution! Simulate the real world crypto trading without putting in your money using Coinseed app.

Coinseed app lets you invest your spare change in crypto and they are announcing a new feature called Play Mode. With this new feature, you can now simulate the real world trading without actually putting in any money. It's a free feature.

Here’s how it works. First, take a minute to signup on Coinseed app. This signup process is by far the fastest way to get started with crypto. Then you can switch to the Play Mode and put in “play” money. Now you can simply select the coins to invest and see how your “investment” performs in the real world. That simple. It’s a very effective way to learn about cryptos because real learning happens when you actually do it. 

Learning how to invest in crypto takes time and practice just like any other skill. The trick is to make it fun so that you can be little more persistent. Share your learning process with others and learn from your peers as well. You can do this by seeing what other people on Coinseed are investing in real time and you can discuss your ideas on the Coinseed platform as well. Hey, you can even read crypto news there!

In conclusion, a lot of people are intrigued by cryptos but afraid of the high risk. Well, Coinseed’s Play Mode just might make it a little less intimidating. Once you get more comfortable with crypto investing then you can simply switch to Coinseed’s regular mode which will let you invest your real money with the least hassle.

They're ""necessary to have a secure network."" But I don't really get the argument. I understand that the hashrate increases, but it consolidates those providing the hashrate.

Let's say that rather than mining zcash, we were all producing cars before the assembly line was invented. The assembly line represents ASICs. However many cars we produce is our hashrate. It's easy to see that the market is much more efficient than the assembly line. And any producer with an assembly line could outperform the combined output of all other producers without assembly lines. With this logic, ASICs are an obvious welcome addition. But this is an imperfect analogy.

In the real world, cars can be customized and sold for various prices. To better fix the analogy, we have to make every manufacturer sell the exact same model. The zcash model. This is important because it creates problems for those looking to become producers in the wake of the assembly line. Now, to enter the market, a producer has to be able to make their cars at least as efficiently as the current manufacturers (who already have assembly lines of their own) or they will be priced out. So very few manufacturers will exist.

This wouldn't seem like a problem, since the overall production rates of cars are up and the market gets to set the price instead of the manufacturers (to better fit the analogy), but there's still one caveat left out. In this world, if any manufacturer has 51% of the supply of cars, they can delete receipts after customers pay for their cars.

So with these modifications to the analogy, it stands to reason that whoever can produce cars the cheapest can control the supply of cars. And once they control the supply, they can ""sell"" cars without ever having to hand them over. Allowing the same cars to be sold over and over again.

Now, you could say that if a manufacturer started using these practices, people would just stop buying cars. Which is true. Plenty of other coins exist. So in mass scale, this is against their best interest. But every now and then? We're putting the network in the top dog's hands. We just hope they don't bite us.",NA,"93xri9",NA,0,NA,"false",1536697976,"false","self","t5_3g2bq","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/zec/comments/93xri9/please_explain_why_my_logic_is_flawed_regarding/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

***Please upvote for support. Let everyone know what Poloniex is! Thanks in advance!***[***https://www.reddit.com/user/Lambent333/comments/90ytyo/poloniex\_ignores\_the\_user\_rights/***](https://www.reddit.com/user/Lambent333/comments/90ytyo/poloniex_ignores_the_user_rights/)

***If you want our issues to be heard feel free and share the link.*** ***I hope Matt Denn will bring Poloniex to Justice!***

Good tidings, dear users. Many of you heard about one of the most active crypto *exchanges* in the world... Poloniex I mean. It is where my story begins...

**1) Poloniex doesn't keep its promises!**

First of all, I'd like to provide you some information about me. I am a Poloniex user, a legacy one with two factor authentication enabled. On 27 May, two weeks before deadline my account had been frozen. It had been frozen in spite of a promise ""Withdrawals will remain enabled at the daily withdrawal limits prior to the deadline"". I wish to point out that it was an official statement;

**2) Poloniex can keep your coins safe from you!**

When I knew my account had been frozen I had no choice. I had to be verified or leave them my coins. So I preferred to be verified. I've submitted them my government issued documents (they are in Cyrillic but there were no information that only international documents are acceptable) and the only adequate response was: "" The funds will be held safely in your account until the verification process is complete"". The thing is I told them that I cannot get international documents in near future and that I submitted my government issued ones. Now Poloniex is taking of my coins as hostages and urging me to be verified but don't allow me to be verified with my own government issued passport! But Poloniex promises to keep our money safe! Poloniex keeps promises, isn't it?

**3) Poloniex doesn't adhere to its User Agreement in case of it relates to user rights!**

I've spent a lot of time to be verified and nobody ever wanted to help me. Only excuses and promises to keep my money safe. Afterwards I claimed to transfer my coins to my friend's deposit adress. And there was reason to believe they would. There we are: In accordance with article 17 of [User Agreement](https://poloniex.com/terms/) ""You will be permitted to transfer Tokens associated with your Account for ninety (90) days after Account deactivation or cancellation unless such transfer is otherwise prohibited (i) under the law, or (ii) by a valid subpoena or court order."" I've created some more tickets and again no one is ever going to help. They tried to ignore my tickets first, then they started to close them as fast as they could and never ever answered me what is the reason they ignore the [User Agreement](https://poloniex.com/terms/) when it relates to user rights!

P.S. There were a lot of agents I have been talking to: Cole, Daniel, Dean, Edward, Fergus, Homer, Laura, Michelle, Rivero, Sandy etc. There might be someone who'd like to help but anyway I didn't get help so far. Be careful with Poloniex, you wouldn't like it kept your coins safe.

The app is using **the official API from CoinMarketCap.com**, and here is why you should at least try it:

+ It's a hidden notification, only way to see it is if you drag your notification tab down, you don't even know it's there.

- It's a lot faster than going on coinmarketcap.com.

* It's free and requires no permissions so it's safe.
 
- Can **set Alarms** and it have **Aggressive Alarm mode**(optional) - perfect when you wanna wake up during nights

- Can view prices in BTC/USD/EURO and **other 30 currencies worldwide !!!**

- View notifications for **Top 50 crypto currencies**

- ‎Customize your portfolio and view notifications of **your portfolio stats**

For zk-SNARKs to function, some public parameters need to be generated that are used to create and validate the zero-knowledge proofs. These parameters are generated from an underlying “secret” with the notable downside that if this secret (colloquially known as the toxic waste) is not destroyed then it is possible that someone with knowledge of it can create false proofs, and as a result, generate an infinite amount of ZEC (it should be noted that the zero-knowledge part of the protocol is not compromised in this instance and privacy is not at risk as data is encrypted on the blockchain).

&amp;#x200B;

Viewing keys: 

Be selectively private if needed. Share with others a certain amount of information about a certain transaction or account. 

It means zcash can be a solution for businesses and real use case: you can be private, but there is a way to reduce the risk of fraud: Regulators could demand a viewing key for control purposes.

Memo field: 

It would be quite annoying for an accountant not to have some text linked with a classic bank transaction...

Does any other private cryptocurrency cover such needs?

But I'm missing something about to represent hashrate in Sol/s.

The system is simple (fork of [NOMP](https://github.com/foxer666/node-open-mining-portal)): We're getting shares (by diffs) from mining devices, store them, sum and calculate hashrate from sum of difficulties. Next formula was work

    Share_Multiplier = 2^32 / Algorithm_Multiplier;
    Hashrate = Share_Multiplier * Difficulty_of_shares / Duration_in_seconds

But supposing that 1Sol/s = 1H/s (according to [1](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/what-is-sol-s-how-do-i-convert-sol-s-to-hashrate/13901), [2](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1680359.0), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/zec/comments/6c9h9i/convert_sol_to_khs/)) I've got about to 300MH/s by this formula and suppose that I can't get `300Msol/s` with one device. On other hand I've started [Z-NOMP](https://github.com/z-classic/z-nomp/) and find out that same device had about `629.93 Sol/s`.

I open the Z-NOMP's code and find JS code which takes hashrate (calculated by formula presented above) and converts it to Sol/s (in short it just divide hashrate by 2 and count 1 sol/s as 500000 H/s).

* Can someone explain why this much contradictory information about convertation sols to hashes?
* Differences are just about to representation of mining device calculations?

At current ZECUSD, we're losing money on the power.

I don't trust Bitmain one bit, and really don't feel like sending $$$ overseas on a hope and a prayer. I'm pretty miffed about how the foundation didn't decide to take action and protect the GPU miners, but not crap I can do about that.

So what should we do?  We're probably going to pull the plug for now, in case the ZEC price gets above our costs sometime soon, but we know its a losing battle.  Are folks with GPU rigs just selling them off and buying ASIC at this point?  Are you moving to other coins?  Just using them as space heaters? What's everyone doing?

I'm brand new to the mining scene.. As an IT engineer, I'm tech savvy enough and built a 6GPU rig for a buddy of mine about a year ago but never really took it any further. This same person bought 5 of the 1st batch A9 ZMasters and recently got me thinking into purchasing an ASIC and trying my luck out.

According to [asicminervalue.com](https://asicminervalue.com) \-- the ZMaster is the most profitable machine, but also one of the most expensive.. for the same price of 1 ZMaster (50ksols), I could purchase 5 Z9 mini's an overclock each one to 16ksols for a total of 80ksols.

I wanted to get the community's opinion on the best ASIC to mine ZCash at the moment. Is anyone running a A9 ZMaster and overclocking it?

One thing I want to add is that I have an arrangement with this friend of mine and will be locating my machines in his facility and won't be paying for power, so I don't need to worry about power consumption between the two machines.. I'm just more concerned with which would mine the fastest and be the most cost effective.

This causes the post to appear to me, but to everyone else its been deleted. Now, why would they undertake such an underhanded tactic?

**End EDIT**



There's a lot of talk about anonymity and privacy as it relates to blockchains. And legacy coins like BTC and BCH that do not have privacy are more effected than those with it. Recently a report surfaced mentioning that cryptos are basically bad news for criminals: 
https://dailyhodl.com/2018/09/16/bitcoin-is-actually-a-money-laundering-tracking-device-that-catches-criminals-report/

**TL;DR is at the bottom**

Why? Because they're easy to track. Once they've got a single piece of identifying info that's linked to an address (say that coinbase transfer to an exchange) then all transactions are linkable to that id. But, privacy coins are different because they obscure this history (or in some cases 'delete' it all together).  However, it can be a little difficult to decide which privacy coin offers the best privacy, along with the best combination of fees, security and usability. 

So with no further ado, here is your simple guide to evaluating privacy coins! Like daily tx throughput is a key metric of btc/blockchain adoption and usage, privacy coins have their own 'key metric' to determine their ability to hide your tx history: the size of their anonymity set. This is basically the number of other people with which your transaction is plausibly 'mixed' so at to sever the link between your address and that coin. The greater this number is, the more difficult it is to associate a coin with your address, thus making it more private. 

To make this easier to understand, it helps to know the following:
**All privacy coins do the same thing, just in vastly different ways.** What is that thing?
Obscuring/removing your linkage to a coin by mixing it with a similar coin denomination from another wallet. Monero is a slight exception to this, since transaction amounts are hidden in the blockchain as well, so there's no need for denominations. Also, your coin is mixed with fake coins that aren't real, instead of coins from other wallets, but no one can tell that from the blockchain so it works.

##PIVX
In PIVX, for example, ~10-20% of all pivx held in wallets is 'gathered' by the accumulator (note it never leaves your control) in a central pool of zpiv using standard denominations like 10 zpiv, 1zpiv, .1zpiv etc. This is a configurable setting in the wallet so some may wish to turn it on/off at their discretion, but recent research has shown that 24% of all PIVX held in wallets is private/zpiv, see u/turtleflax's comment below. 

After all of that, by using a zero-knowledge proof which cryptographically proves you owned whatever zpiv was minted from your wallet without any linking information to you, zpiv is 'sent' to your wallet and shows up with no transaction history. So the anonymity set is ~~10%~~, ~24% nowadays, of all PIVX held in wallets, which is obviously huge.

##ZCoin
ZCoin and PIVX uses the same strategy as both implement the ZeroCoin protocol, which itself is just a specification, PIVX and ZCoin are implementations *of* that spec. Same idea with the denominations. PIVX's implementation is much more advanced however. ZCoin doesn't have an accumulator or anything and its privacy is optional. 

However, its not possible to break a Zerocoin/ZCoin/PIVX transaction because there is nothing to break. It would be like trying to guess someone's password just by them logging in and proving they know their password and it works. That doesn't give you any information that would help. Furthermore, the total anonymity set is around 6.5% of the total supply which puts it comfortably in the same region as PIVX.

##ZCash
ZCash is an implementation of the ZeroCash protocol which is an improvement on the ZeroCoin protocol. The cool thing about ZCash is that it also hides the amount of the transaction. ZCash's privacy is optional and the blockchain is split between t-addresses and z-addresses. t-addrs are transparent and contain visible balances just like Bitcoin, which ZCash is a software fork of. z-addrs are shielded. ZCash appears to have two kinds of shielded transactions (shielded and fully shielded). 

I'm not sure of the difference between them, but according to this handy block explorer: https://explorer.zcha.in/statistics/usage, shielded txs are far more prevalent than fully shielded ones. The difference between them may be that fully shielded txs are transactions between two z-addrs while a tx that is 'just shielded' may be one between a z-addr and a t-addr and possibly a t-addr and a z-addr, but again, I'm not sure.

The developers claim that the anonymity set is very large in comparison to coins like Dash, and since it is based on the ZeroCoin protocol like PIVX and ZCoin, it is reasonable to assume its anon set is similarly large and based on a proportion of the supply, though where among the three it stands is of course up for debate/verification. Perhaps as large as the shielded value colume for any time period, also note that is a lower bound, so for the past month: 394989 ZEC would be the total shielded ZEC, so this seems a reasonable lower-bound on the Anon-set. Its hard to Tell between this and PIVX which is larger.

##Dash
In Dash, it depends on how many rounds you mix. Each coin is once again broken down into standard denominations like 10, 1, .1 .01 Dash. Each round involves a minimum of three different wallets. So take the number of participants and raise it to the rounds you mix-th power, and that is your minimum anonymity set. So mixing four rounds gives you a minimum anonymity set of (3 participants)4 rounds = 81. Eight rounds gives you a min set of 38 = 6,561.

 Could be more if more than three wallets were involved in any single mix, which is possible.
However, it could be less if the same participants are used per round, which is unlikely. This is still a HUGE anonymity set; however, its probably at least an order of magnitude less than PIVX and ZCoin unless you were to get 4-5 wallets mixing per round. Still, even 81 could be rightly considered overkill, especially since considering the nature of privateSend and the random separation between 'minting' and spending makes Dash immune to timing analysis attacks. The determination of which coin to use will come down to your anonymity needs. How private do you need to be?

##Monero
In Monero, the anonymity set is the number of mixins used at the time of your transaction. Which is currently 7. Monero originally had optional privacy where the min mixin was 0 and those transactions were transparent like btc's. However, having these 0 mixin transactions together with the higher mixin transactions allowed for higher ones to be deanoned, that and 3 forms of timing analysis attacks forced the min mixin to be raised to 3, then 5 and now 7. 

#TL;DR

#So in short, if you want to rank privacy coins by their anon-set size (which is the only thing that matters) the list is as follows:

##1. **ZeroCoin and ZeroCash implementations: PIVX, ZCoin, ZCash**
##2. **Dash**
##3. **Monero**

Note: Each tier represents a range of at least &gt;1 order of magnitude greater anonymity set. So ZCoin, ZCash and PIVX are all grouped together, even though PIVX may have an anon-set 10-50x greater than ZCash or ZCoin (just an example, not a real figure), all three of them are still going to have anon sets 1-4 orders of magnitude greater than Dash, and like 6-7 greater than Monero. Monero's default min mixin is 7 and the max definable in the gui wallet IIRC is 26. Be aware however that using higher, rarer ring sizes causes your transaction to stick out.

Due to the nature of how they are selected, there are wide ranges for the anon sets of these coins, except for monero. But especially so for that of Dash, which may on occasion cross into the grey zone between numbers 1 and 2 due to uncertainty around the number of wallets participating, and the fact that an attacker will never know how many rounds a tx is going through. 

And because Dash doesn't rely on encryption for its privacy, if you don't catch/trace the transaction when its happening, i.e. by buying up 70% or more of the masternodes, you can never deanon it. If you use encryption, especially for the entire blockchain, you paint a large target on your blockchain. If your encryption is ever broken, then all past transactions will be deanoned at once, so not good. This is a benefit of steganography over some encryption based privacy schemes.

I did not calculate for other machines, but it does not matter since I did not use any (or used minimal) electricity cost.

Even with zero mining cost, you would not be able to payback your cost in a very realistic scenario of as little as twofold increase in difficulty within a year starting from today. Who do we kid, difficulty would increase much more. If mining is unprofitable, POW cannot be supported going forward.
