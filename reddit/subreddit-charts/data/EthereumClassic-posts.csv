ClassicEtherWallet chrome extension sent 44 ether from wrong ether version... may be lost to me forever?","Sorry for being such a noob here, I'll try to explain the best that I can.

I bought into Ethereum on the very first ether sale in 2014. Recently I remembered that I had the ether and that there was a chain split. 

I knew that I should have coins on both chains. I took the ethereum classic and tried to send it to poloeniex so that I could trade with it.

That was over an hour ago, the transactions show as received http://etherhub.io/addr/0x17f4a08dda74df38f16ca0ff972253266b30f8c2

However, I sent from two addresses, one was created pre split, and the other after split (I believe). 

Now the balance shows on both chains. https://etherscan.io/address/0xb316904D277915889E122fe68F6280052Df663BF

Poloneix isn't showing any deposits in over an hour though. I'm not sure if they have the keys for the ETH version. I know it's the same key, but I'm not sure what's ""really"" going on with my money. I thought the chrome extension would only touch the ETC and not the ETH.

a noob friend of mine asked me to buy some ETC for them from Kraken. There aren't many user friendly ETC wallets, so i recommended Jaxx.

After buying, i asked her for her ETC address. She made a mistake and copied an ETH address instead.

I am no ETH expert. I am looking for advice on how to recover the ETC and send them to the correct address.

Is this possible? I have had a look online and it seems its possible. The basic idea being to use the private keys associated with the ETH address to access it and resend the ETC to the right address.

But how and where? Links appreciated.

Thanks.

Maybe one of the teams or Dexaran can start an ICO/donation to get money from community to build a brand new website.

Current website problems:

- Free template available also in some other coins (doesn't look professional at all)
- Doesn't present any concrete information that expose the value of ETC:
	- roadmap
	- teams behind the project
	- the fact that has a investment group behind
	- short term/long term goals
	- projects based on ETC
	- documentation on how to build dApps in front of ETC
	- documentation and tutorials about smart contracts 
	- what's the difference between ETC and ETH 

Or where the information is presented, the information it's already outdated. Excepting documentation part where should be
very clear in order to attract developers and it's a bit of work to make it happened the other parts of the website should be simple

What do you think ?

UPDATE: phyrooo already started working on something but we need a volunteer graphic designer. In case anyone interested let us know

#### *Problem that is solved by this project:*

[ENS](https://ens.domains/) is one of the core components of Ethereum ecosystem. I think that it is important to implement the same service on ETC to stay up-to-date and compatible with Ethereum chain.

#### *Here you can track the progress:*

- [ECNS main repo](https://github.com/Dexaran/ECNS)

- [Web interface for ECNS](https://ethereumproject.github.io/etherwallet/#ens)

#### **Update summary:**

HashRegistrar contract was compiled with a new 0.4.14 compiler that allows to resolve gas issues. In any case, the use of ECNS requires a bit more gas than ENS (520000 for auction instead of 500000 that ENS requires).

ECNS is ready to use.

# 2. [ClassicEtherWallet](https://ethereumproject.github.io/etherwallet/) update

#### *Problem that is solved by this project:*

1. MyEtherWallet have not yet merged a pull request to support ECNS. As the result of this I've decided to make ETC-related interface to provide this functionality.

2. Color theme in ClassicEtherWallet will now change depending on the selected node. This will visually distinguish the selected chain. This is important to resolve problems of user mistakes with wrong chain selection.

#### *Here you can track the progress:*

 - [CEW github repo](https://github.com/ethereumproject/etherwallet/tree/gh-pages)

#### **Update summary:**

Integrated latest MyEtherWallet updates into ClassicEtherWallet. Added color theme patch to prevent user mistakes. Added ECNS support fot Ethereum CLassic chain.

# 3. [Viper online compiler](https://codepen.io/yograterol/full/aypYjP/) is created.

#### *Problem that is solved by this project:*

Smart-contract hacking.

We all know that smart-contracts are often hacked. It is caused by problems of Solidity programming language. As a smart-contract auditor I can say that Viper could significantly improve readability of smart-contracts and boost their safety.

#### *Here you can track the progress:*

- [Viper compiler creation proposal](https://github.com/Dexaran/ICO/issues/21)

- [Viper main repo on Ethereum github](https://github.com/ethereum/viper)

#### **Update summary:**

A server for Viper compiler was launched. A basic version of UI was created. This is enough to start developing Viper smart-contracts since you can now turn the source code into bytecode to deploy it and receive ABI to interact with contract.

This is a very basic version, more updates are coming.

Viper is in development now. Some features are still missing.

Great thanks to [@yograterol](https://github.com/yograterol) for his contribution.

# 4. [ClassicMask](https://github.com/Dexaran/ICO/issues/8) plugin developmen is in progress

#### *Problem that is solved by this project:*

Some DApps require MetaMask API to work. These DApps are incompatible with ETC chain since there is no MetaMask analogue for ETC. ETC is becoming deprecated since DApps that could be built on top of ETH could not be developed on ETC chain.

#### *Here you can track the progress:*

 - [CLassicMask github repo](https://github.com/Dexaran/ClassicMask)

#### **Update summary:**

To be honest I don't really enjoy how the things are going with ClassicMask. The progress is slow and more things still needs to be done. [@coderwithattitude](https://github.com/coderwithattitude) is currently working on it. We need to fix some issues before release.

We will guaranteed add ClassicMask support on ClassicEtherWallet.

I'm also planning to add ClassicMask support on MyEtherWallet but it depends on MEW developers reaction.

# 5. [SWARM](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/14891)

#### *Problem that is solved by this project:*

Decentralized storage with integrated incentivisation system will significantly improve ETH/ETC ecosystem. This will also allow to stay up-to-date with Ethereum and not to become a deprecated project.

#### **Update summary:**

I have created a proposal for adding multicurrency support for SWARM. I think that the whole ""Ethereum-based family"" (UBQ, Musicoin, Expanse, ETC, ETH) will benefit from having a common storage.

This is a technically feasible solution.

# 6. [Decentralized Mining Pool](https://github.com/Dexaran/contracts/tree/develop) is in development.

#### *Problem that is solved by this project:*

Mining centralization.

Mining centralization is a known problem of all POW cryptocurrencies. As ETC is going to stand with POW for a long period of time I've decided that we need to introduce a solution of this problem. Fortunately we can create a mining pool that will be governed by smart-contract and this is a valuable solution.

#### *Here you can track the progress:*

 - [My main github repo](https://github.com/Dexaran/contracts/tree/develop) (develop branch)

 - [SmartPool gitter channel](https://gitter.im/SmartPool/Lobby)

#### **Update summary:**

The work is still in progress. We have updated contracts. I assume that I will deploy them soon enough but we still need to create an Ubuntu distributive with pre-installed programs that would be required for this pool.

#### Remark

All these projects are in active development stage. You feedback/bug reports are always welcome!

I'll give a brief overview of all the advances in ETC development from a technical point of view for users who do not have the technical knowledge or development expertise to evaluate it.

### ETCDEV team

No financial transparency. Always joke, instead of answering the question about their source of funding, but still stating that they are paying full time for the developers. Violating software licenses (gastracker.io is running a modified version of geth to show internal calls of transactions but I didn't found the published source of this modification. It is GPL violation).

They solved a problem of ETC sustainability at the very first stages. They changed a couple of variables in geth source to diffuse difficulty bomb and thats all that they did. Emerald wallet is solving only one problem: lack of news. It is necessary for nothing. It doesn't solves any problems of ETC. It is not needed but they are working on it.

It's a group of web developers who are not competent enough to show any development, so they imitate what they can. Emerald and SputnikVM were choosen, because you can not verify if they really work or not.

Their professional behavior leads to the fact that the developers of MetaMask and MEW are more likely to support UBQ than ETC.

### Commonwealth

It is represented by Dexaran, who is a well-recognizable Ethereum hacker (no real proofs besides transaction history and his own words) and ex-developer of AlethZERO if I did not miss something.

This is the only team that is working on solving the actual ETC problems instead of just doing what they know how to do.

I deeply respect his development skills, and I think the progress of his work is terrific, but what about his managerial skills? He seems to be a solo hero.

It's obvious that teamwork is very important here. How will he manage his own team? How will he interact with other teams in future? He didn't said anything about this!

### IOHK

IOHK is leaded by Charles Hoskinson, ex-ceo of Ethereum. 

They are focused on research, and they seem to be very careful in their decisions. They will not start a power struggle, and they behave very correctly in relation to other teams.

Their researches seems to be graceful and they have choosing a policy of separating from Ethereum. The correct solution also seems to be that they began to develop a node client from scratch in order to be confident in the qualifications of the developers who are working on it.

Unlike the Commonwealth, however, they did not solve any of the current problems of ETC and exclusively focused on their own affairs.

### Summary

The most mature team seems to be IOHK.

The most progressive team is Commonwealth.

ETCDEV damages the reputation of Ethereum Classic and pursues its own goals at the expense of the community.",NA,"6tnrl8",NA,0,NA,"false",1504680894,"false","self","t5_3fgtx","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/EthereumClassic/comments/6tnrl8/critical_overview_of_three_ethereum_classic/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

If we want ETC to develop and grow we need money and community support to see that vision become reality. The ability to collect funds monthly from community approved projects would separate us from the rest and propel development.

If the treasury model from IOHK was implemented at this price of $13.42 we would have around $2,484,605 of monthly funds that would go towards projects that benefit ETC and the voters.

Failure to move this along robs the community of our collective economic power that we posses.

The least we can do is continue to talk about it and keep discussion going on how to implement this or something similar.

Treasury model helps to preserve our independence and withstand attacks from external forces. It also is beneficial to the miners and community that depends on ETC as a source of revenue.

We NEED a treasury model. We cannot be left behind.

Here is the link: https://gitter.im/ethereumproject/general

Just sign up with github account to start communicating.

The reasons why I like Gitter more than SLack:

- **Closer to other development channels**. The most part of solidity devs are hanging on [ethereum/solidity gitter channel](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity). In order to establish better communication I prefer to use gitter also.

- **More convenient for developers**. Gitter is natively connected with github accounts so you can look at every persons github activity and it is more convenient to share github deeds in gitter.

- **The public is much wider.** Ethereum's [welcome channel](https://gitter.im/ethereum/welcome) is larger than the whole ETC slack. I think that beginning to closely communicate will help us to merge our communities. It will be beneficial for both our projects as we have common needs such are Solidity/Viper developers and so on.

NOTE: This is mostly relevant for developers and community members that are interested in development. If you like SLack then there are no problems with it.

# 2. [ERC223 maintaining](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/223).

#### *Problem that is solved by this project:*

Money losses. ERC20 token standard contains [a vulnerability](https://medium.com/@dexaran820/erc20-token-standard-critical-problems-3c10fd48657b), but it is very widely used.

This resulted in the loss of more than $ 500,000 ERC20 tokens in the Ethereum network.

The problem of ERC20 tokens has unlimited scalability, and it's only a matter of time if someone loses $ 60,000,000 if no one will stop it.

#### *Here you can track the progress:*

- [ERC223 github repo](https://github.com/Dexaran/ERC23-tokens).

- [ERC223 issue on Ethereum github](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/223).

#### **Summary:**

Some important steps were made in this direction:

- [Bittrex exchange is re-standardized](https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@cryptocoinclub/erc223-deposit-contracts-are-now-good-for-bittrex) for the sake of compatibility with ERC223.

- `function transfer(address,uint256,bytes,string)` was decided a good solution for custom fallbacks implementation. This was [moved to recommended implementation](https://github.com/Dexaran/ERC23-tokens/commit/20f9baaa34dce1b02b38e88247be4c6426d13d0b) since it is not a core part of token standard.

- ERC20-compatible example was removed from the ERC223 discussion since it is not a part of token standard.

If you are wondering why this standard is done exactly so, then you can read my recent discussion with Nick Johnson from Ethereum Foundation: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6uckdx/reminder_about_problems_of_most_erc20_tokens/dlui07v/

#### *The next steps in the development of this project:*

- I'm planning to suggest already-existing companies like Golem to launch a standardized contracts. It is possible to update ERC20 tokens to ERC223.

- I'm also planning to develop a special interface that will allow users to update their tokens with a single button ""UPDATE"". Fortunately we have ClassicEtherWallet and we can utilize it for this purpose since it supports ETH chain now.

# 3. [Crosschain ENS](https://github.com/Dexaran/ICO/issues/28).

#### *Rationale:*

This doesn't solve any of the existing problems but significantly improves the whole Ethereum infrastructure. I believe that Ethereum Classic, UBQ, Expanse and others belong to the common Ethereum ecosystem and we will benefit from making bridges between our own ecosystems. *This is the first step in this direction.*

#### *Here you can track the progress:*

- [Crosschain implementation proposal](https://github.com/Dexaran/ICO/issues/28).

- You can also track it in ClassicEtherWallet repo because we are planning to implement crosschain ENS lookup in CEW.

#### **Summary:**

The proposal was formally described and submitted. I'm waiting for feedback from other Ethereum developers. Expanse and UBIQ developers agreed with my proposal and we decided to use `.etc` TLD for ECNS, `.ubq` for UBIQ ENS, `.exp` for EXP ENS.

If this will be implemented, everyone could use the ECNS name in any of the Ethereum-compatible chains.

# 4. [ClassicEtherWallet updates](https://github.com/randytorres/etherwallet/tree/add-color-and-replace-mew).

#### *Problem that is solved by this project:*

- Lack of the ability to implement interfaces for applications that run on Ethereum Classic chain only.

- CEW deprecation compared to MyEtherWallet.

#### *Here you can track the progress:*

[Randy Torres](https://github.com/randytorres) is currently working on ClassicEtherWallet updates.

- [Randy's repo](https://github.com/randytorres/etherwallet/tree/add-color-and-replace-mew).

- [Dexaran's etherwallet repo](https://github.com/Dexaran/etherwallet).

- [Ethereum CLassic etherwallet repo](https://github.com/ethereumproject/etherwallet).

#### **Summary:**

We are currently working on merging the latest MEW updates into CEW (tho restore their absolute compatibility). This will make it easier to send pull requests to MEW and propose our own projects (such are crosschain ENS lookup and DexNS implementation).

We will implement crosschain ENS lookup at CEW first and then propose the patch into MEW.

#### *The next steps in the development of this project:*

- Crosschain ENS implementation

- DexNS integration

- CLassicMask support

- ERC20 &gt;&gt; ERC223 update interface

- Personally I think that it is a good idea to natively implement DEX voting interface in ClassicEtherWallet.

# 5. [CLassicMask](https://github.com/Dexaran/ClassicMask) extension is ready to use.

#### *Problem that is solved by this project:*

- MetaMask is providing API for DApps. MetaMask becomes an important part of Ethereum ecosystem and there were some DApps that [requires it to work](https://github.com/MetaMask/faq/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md). Now every DApp that requires MetaMask is compatible with Ethereum CLassic!

#### *Here you can track the progress:*

- [CLassicMask github repo](https://github.com/Dexaran/ClassicMask).

#### **Summary:**

CLassicMask extension is ready to use. You can install it from the `dist` branch of the CLassicMask repo. 

#### **Follow [this link](https://github.com/Dexaran/ClassicMask/tree/dist) and follow the instructions to install the CLassicMask extension.**

#### *The next steps in the development of this project:*

- We plan to integrate ClassicMask with the online Viper compiler so that developers can deploy their contracts on any Ethereum-compatible chain or testnet directly from the development environment.

# 6. [Decentralized Mining Pool](https://github.com/Dexaran/contracts/tree/develop) is in development.

#### *Problem that is solved by this project:*

Mining centralization.

#### *Here you can track the progress:*

 - [My main github repo](https://github.com/Dexaran/contracts/tree/develop) (develop branch)

 - [SmartPool gitter channel](https://gitter.im/SmartPool/Lobby)

#### **Summary:**

Contracts are ready to deploy.

I have considered that we need to charge contracts with 500 ETC to compensate bad luck miners at the initial stage.

We need to artificially submit DAG epoch data to the pool contract. I'm currently working on tool that will allow us to calculate DAG data that needs to be submitted to each pool contract.

# Other updates.

1. I talked with Nick Johnson about adding new TLDs to ENS and ECNS. I decided that I would not add TLDs to the ECNS until there were any steps taken to integrate ENS with ICANN.
2. We are considering the possibility of cooperation with UBQ and Expanse developers. There is a lot of common ground between our projects (web UIs, wallets and naming services for example).
3. I have decided to delegate PR company to marketing team. Ethereum Commonwealth will focus on development.
4. I have decided to delay any organizational work such as web-site creation and moving github proposals into Ethereum Commonwealth organization until the end of our ICO.
5. Our updates would be available [on medium](https://medium.com/@dexaran820/ethereum-commonwealth-development-update-23-aug-2017-d0b63e432614).

I want to use forwarding-only wallets / contracts that never have a non-zero balance. I want the wallet / contract to accept a bespoke payment that includes a forwarding address, to check the forwarding address against an approved list and either to automatically immediately forward to the approved new address or to reject and return the payment.

Is this possible and if so, is it more of a complex proposal requiring a coding project or a fairly trivial task that could easily be set up easily?

I need another wallet / contract that automatically equally splits and forwards any incoming funds between a list of recipients.

What would you folks suggest would be first steps to accomplishing these goals?

Here is a list of updates:

1. Recent MEW updates merged.

2. MetaMask / CLassicMask support enabled.

3. ETC node is set to default.

4. ENS/ECNS name registration logic updated. We are preparing to add crosschain ENS support soon.

The next goal is crosschain ENS implementation. We are currently working on it. We will also add DEX tokens to default list of ETC tokens. After the crosschain ENS we will start to work on native DexNS implementation.

This changes will allow users:

- Register a name on any chain and use it on all Ethereum-compatible chains. For example `dexaran.etc` will work on ETH/ ETC/ UBQ/ EXP/ Musicoin/ SoilCoin chains, not only on ETC.

- DexNS will allow to add tokens by names. Say goodbye to adding custom tokens or proposing MEW patches for each token with the corresponding name/decimals and contract addresses.

- Say goodbye to contract ABIs for. DexNS will allow to interact with registered contracts without ABI.

New to the forum and ETC, but was mining ETH before the hard fork and when the fork happened a lot was made of how easy it was for me to not do anything. Most of the websites were saying how secure everything was going to stay and to just not panic about the ""HACK"". I am not a computer programmer and didn't think I could understand the fundamental code changes. I decided not to vote immediately when I checked my ETH wallet because I needed more information. Before I knew it, it was over and done with. I never really had a chance to think or learn more. 

Once it was over, it was like nothing happened. ETH was still here and there was a new chain ETC that was classic or something. I only thought about ETC back then as far as the name and it sounded inferior but still good. Kinda like a classic sports car is good but not like a new one. I thought classic, and thought 'oldie but goodie'. 

Recently I have been looking into what happened during the fork and am having mixed feelings about the whole thing. I find myself mourning that one of the fundamental code of ethics in crypto was broken. Especially when it directly benefited the coders and their financial interests not the average user.
 Looking back, when did I vote for ETH? Was I counted in the majority? I guess so because the wallet stayed ETH not ETC. When thinking about it very briefly back then, I wanted to stay with what was working before. I wanted to stay with Ethereum not fork it off. I was also under the impression that ethereum was like other crypto where updates would be decided by everyone in a disorganized and chaotic matter over time. But this seemed to just happen and everyone just went along with it. I think this is mostly due to the fact that an average user who hears 'Hack' - Update - Fork . Thinks that the fork is not updated and is inferior, especially when the naming implies old. Who would use the hack prone fork? This is factually incorrect in many ways, but the mentality of security is very conservative. Why would I change over? That would mean going from ETH to ETC and change is not conservative. I think many users thought that ETH was the conservative position because it had the same name, without realizing that ETC was the way things were working.

If ETH and the fork had to change their names I think it would have made the user actually think about the direction of the community. Lets say that they had to rebrand as ETB , Ethereum Business, which is essentially the debate. 

The fork was rushed and I think many people have forgotten about the whole thing, especially with everything that was happening in the world at that time. If you asked the community before DAO if the coding team should be allowed to unilaterally change the blockchain, they would tell you a resounding NO. If you asked them how to get your coins back that got sent out of your wallet to an address you don't own, they would say that you are shit out of luck; with great power comes great responsibility. So why did this same group suddenly decide to change their opinions? I don't think they did, I think the 'vote' was framed to prefer one choice by appealing to familiarity and security.

Now it seems that people are remembering ETC and looking into it. ETC is the core idea of what ETH was. Now I wish I voted for ETC when I had the chance so at least my opinions were known. 

I think the hate from the ETH community for ETC is due to the fact that the accusations of tampering has merit. They want to eat their cake and have it too. When you point out the inconsistencies in their logic they get angry and emotional because their logic brain isn't giving them the answer they want to hear. They go on about anything else besides the core issues; is it okay to tamper with the blockchain? Or is what was agreed upon now always agreed upon in the future? 

Anyways, thanks for reading, I just thought my opinion went unheard during the fork and wanted to share my thoughts.",NA,"6xstcw",NA,0,NA,"false",1507295105,"false","self","t5_3fgtx","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/EthereumClassic/comments/6xstcw/thoughts_on_ethereum_classic/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

[Ethereum Commonwealth ICO](https://dexaran.github.io/ICO/) is closing tomorrow!

We have raised 5580 ETC total during the ICO (some of these funds are already paid out). It's not that much to start protocol development, but I believe that it is enough to make a lot of Ethereum CLassic improvements. Anyways, I'm happy to continue my work on this project.

At least, everything that is going on with ETC Commonwealth funding is [transparently documented](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-ibJXI9IfrkKloLgN6RHxoXeCbdqa9mti1afTcO1BQk/edit#gid=979560349) and is available for monitoring through transactions in ETC blockchain.

As I wrote earlier, we will do what we have collected enough funding for.

We are already working on different projects and we have already made significant progress.

### Here is a list of Ethereum Commonwealth projects:

- [LETH mobile wallet](https://github.com/Dexaran/ICO/issues/23). Thanks to @prophetdaniel for a lot of work here!

- Solidity coding standard proposal was replaced with Viper adoption.

- [Viper remote compiler](https://codepen.io/yograterol/full/aypYjP/) was deployed. Thanks to [@yograterol](https://github.com/yograterol/viperid). You can also watch the [main Viper repo](https://github.com/ethereum/viper) on github. For any questions I will recommend to ask @vbuterin on the corresponding [viper gitter channel](https://gitter.im/ethereum/viper).

- [ECNS](https://github.com/Dexaran/ECNS) contracts were deployed. Ethereum CLassic Naming Service is fully operational! Contracts: [Registry](https://gastracker.io/addr/0xb96836a066ef81ea038280c733f833f69c23efde) / [Registrar (Auction)](https://gastracker.io/addr/0x7564711a9c72edfb5ca10f2962066c707398121d) / [Public Resolver](https://gastracker.io/addr/0x4fa1fc37a083abe4c53b6304f389042bc0566855) / [Reverse Registrar](https://gastracker.io/addr/0x9434e3f592f5d63de25dbd54af4bd58b822b6136) . You can start registering names via [CLassicEtherWallet](https://ethereumproject.github.io/etherwallet/#ens) now.

- [ClassicEtherWallet](https://github.com/Dexaran/ICO/issues/26) updates were made. We have integrated the latest MEW updates, added ECNS support and now we are preparing to implement the crosschain ENS lookup system.

- [Crosschain SWARM proposal](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/14891) was made and the discussion started. I will also recommend to watch the [Let's Talk ETC: Swarm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzuONu69ho) interview with Viktor Tron (SWARM developer). Great thanks to Christian Seberino. For any questions I will recommend to ask Viktor Tron on the corresponding [gitter swarm channel](https://gitter.im/ethereum/swarm).

- [CLassicMask](https://github.com/Dexaran/ClassicMask) browser extension wallet.

### Development

There are three developers working on Ethereum Commonwealt projects at the moment:

1. [@Dexaran](https://github.com/Dexaran)

2. [@yograterol](https://github.com/yograterol) (Viper, Viper compiler, CLassicMask)

3. [@randytorres](https://github.com/randytorres) (CLassicEtherWallet updates &amp; MEW patches, crosschain ENS implementation on CEW, DexNS updates)

I've decided that I will place a reward on solving a separate tasks and hire developers to solve them one by one.

I will receive 400 ETC/month working on Ethereum Commonwealth projects full-time. As a smart-contract auditor I often earned 500-650 ETC/month (with avg price rate of $18/ETC) but I'm expecting a significant price growth so I decided to work on the described conditions.

Currently, I'm personally discussing possibilities of SWARM multicurrency implementation, crosschain ENS implementation and ERC223 support on Bitfinex. Also, I'm going to read the IOHK Treasury paper in the near future.

ERC223 latest updates are consuming a lot of my time too. I hope that we will make a significant ERC223 update soon and I will continue my work on decentralized smart-contract pool.

For any questions: dexaran@ethereumclassic.org

Here is a proposal to implement [staking emission model in DEX token](https://github.com/Dexaran/ICO/issues/29).

It seems to be technically possible to implement an increase of the balance in proportion to the current balance of the address and passed time. As for me, it looks like an interesting technical solution.

### Example:

You have purchased 100 DEX during the ICO.

1 month later your balance will increase and you will have 101 DEX on your balance.

2 months later your balance will increase and you will have 102.01 DEX on your balance.

3 months later your balance will increase and you will have 103.0301 DEX on your balance and so on ...

### Updating the DEX token contract

I'm planning to update [DEX token contracts](https://github.com/Dexaran/ICO/tree/master/ERC223_Simple_Token) because of the huge set of [ERC223 updates](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/223#issuecomment-327709226).

I don't have much money to put in them, but found this website:

[earncrypto.com](https://www.earncrypto.com/earn-free-ethereum-classic/?r=65118)

I have already withdrawn some Reddcoin and Monero, and it has been smooth sailing so far. You can change the coin you're earning anytime. Yes, I get referral commission. But I do believe in their service, and wouldn't be wasting my time if I hadn't seen significant earnings in my account.

What I do is go to Earn Ripple (I prefer to go for cheaper currencies personally) at the top left, and then Watch Videos. Load up a video from EngageMe, a VideoLab, and let them run when you're asleep or not using the computer/s.

For those who want to get into cryptos but don't have as much money as they would like to invest, this gives you the opportunity to build a modest yet diverse cryptocurrency portfolio at no expense. You never know which will be the next one to hit $5,000.

Let me know if you have questions and I will do my best to help.

[DexNS main repo](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/DexNS/) is now moved to Ethereum Commonwealth organization.

After a half of year in debugging mode the final version of the DexNS contract have  been deployed.

Here you can find the [Frontend contract](https://gastracker.io/addr/0x5e9b151eb9742c20679e1d96e5c3633678cab724) which allows to register and manage DexNS names and [State storage contract](https://gastracker.io/addr/0x429611c633806a03447391026a538a022e1e2731) which provides access to already-registered names.

I think that the Naming Service is ready for mass adoption and I'm planning to implement DexNS support on [ClassicEtherWallet](https://ethereumproject.github.io/etherwallet/) in the near future.

# What is the purpose of this project?

**I'm aiming to significantly boost the  usability of smart-contracts for ordinary users.**

This Naming Service is specially designed to allow contract developers to make their smart-contracts more user-friendly. We can easily abstract users from **hex-addresses** and **ABIs** now.

Furthermore, DexNS can be used on cross chain basis which allows to improve the whole Ethereum and cryptocurrency ecosystem. 

# What are DexNS advantages over ENS?

DexNS and ENS are two different services. They are designed for different purposes, and each of them is more convenient for what was its original purpose.

The purpose of DexNS is to boost a mass adoption of smart-contracts and make them more user-friendly.

As the result of this DexNS is:

- More user-friendly and easier to use.

- Doesn't require protocol or infrastructure improvements to work.

- Allows to register Names instantly. You can just pick the desired name without a need to participate in auction, unseal bids and calling the resolver contract.

- Instantly name registering allows to integrate DexNS with such smart-contract based services like [TokenMint](https://github.com/ethereumproject/TokenMint).

- Less scalable, because it has a narrower specialization (smart-contract area).

- Less DDOS resistant. I'm planning to introduce a fee for DexNS names registering to solve this issue.

DexNS is currently running in free mode and all Names are free. Each DexNS name will cost 1 ETC after the integration with CEW will be finished.",NA,"70mnx3",NA,0,NA,"false",1507533461,"false","self","t5_3fgtx","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/EthereumClassic/comments/70mnx3/dexns_30_the_naming_service_that_will_facilitate/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

It is deployed on ETH chain

GNT address on ETC chain (no contract): http://gastracker.io/addr/0xa74476443119a942de498590fe1f2454d7d4ac0d

This is the same address on ETC chain and it contains 5000 ETC ($58,000 at the moment).

The problem is that Golem (or any other) contract can reject Ether (ETH on Ethereum chain) but there is no contract on ETC chain. If you send a transaction with Ether to the contract which is not designed to receive Ether then the transaction will fail and your money will remain at your balance. If you send a transaction with Ether to the normal address then the transaction will submit and money transfer will occur.

If the user will send ETH to the contract address then the transaction will fail. If If the user will send ETC/ UBQ/ EXP to the same address then the transaction will submit and ETC  (UBQ/ EXP) will be lost. This happens because there is no contract on this address on ETC/ UBQ/ EXP chains at all. It's just an address without bytecode and it will receive any money transfers.

We are planning to fix this problem at the UI level on CLassicEtherWallet and CLassicMask:

https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Roadmap/issues/26#issuecomment-330129919

Feel free to contact me if you have any thoughts/ suggestions about how to deal with this problem.

Also, I'm planning to contact Golem developers. We can deploy an emergency contract on the ETC chain and extract stuck ETC. If my idea will succeed then I will refund all users who lost their ETC in GNT contract address.

Organizational: [Ethereum Commonwealth github organization](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth)


#### *Rationale:*

You can track the progress of each Ethereum Commonwealth's project here. 

Issue of trust: you can trust the source codes from the Ethereum Commonwealth official repository, but I will not recommend to trust the source codes that are published somewhere else.

#### **Update summary:**

I have moved all Ethereum Commonwealth projects into the official repository. 

The ICO issues, which were previously used to discuss a further roadmap for development, are now located in the [Roadmap Repository](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Roadmap/issues). Feel free to submit a new issue if you have something valuable to propose.

Financial state links are now located at [financial state repository](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/financial-state).

As I said, I often hire temporary developers to solve certain tasks one by one. As a result, not all members of the Commonwealth Ethereum will be publicly listed on the organization page.

# 2. [CLassicMask](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/ClassicMask) updates

#### *Rationale:*

- Staying up to date with Ethereum infrastructure.

- Maintaining DApps compatibility.

- Secure browser extension wallet.


#### *Here you can track the progress:*

- [CLassicMask repository](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/ClassicMask/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed).

#### **Update summary:**

CLassicMask is updated with the latest patches of MetaMask. ClassicMask provides all the functionality of MetaMask and even more. Classic version allows multichain support, which means that you can use one address on ETC, ETH, EXP and test networks. 

ClassicMask, in contrast to MetaMask, provides advanced functions such as manual evaluation of transactions ""GAS"" and ""GasPrice"", which is necessary for several services.

It can also be said that the CLassicMask is technically prepared for crosschain ENS implementation.

In addition, CLassicMask extension is now available on Firefox addons too. Thanks to [@PooSham](https://github.com/PooSham) for his contribution.

https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/classicmask-beta/?src=ss

# 3. Upcoming CLassicEtherWallet updates.

#### *Rationale:*

- Web interface to interact with Ethereum-compatible blockchains.

- Platform for the development of further infrastructure updates.

#### *Here you can track the progress:*

- [CLassicEtherWallet source code](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/etherwallet) on github.

- [Etherwallet development proposal](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Roadmap/issues/26) on Ethereum Commonwealth roadmap.


#### **Update summary:**

I believe that the most important issues at the moment are security &amp; UX improvements.

I know there was a lot of confusion with random transactions, wrong chain selection and other user mistakes. I'm going to solve these problems and make interaction with Ethereum CLassic blockchain as convenient and easy as possible.

I have recently discovered one more issues that results in lost $58,000. We will improve the crosschain security of the CEW with the next update.

It is also planned to integrate the DexNS support into ClassicEtherWalet. Imagine that you can add a token by simply typing its name, for example GNT. All the rest will be done automatically: the token will be loaded with all the characteristics of the contract and in the corresponding network without any additional action from your side. I think that this will eliminate a lot of user mistakes while operating with contracts and tokens.

The work is currently in progress and will be merged in the next patch.

# 4. Security issues. Recovering the lost funds and preventing further losses.

#### **Summary:**

I have just investigated one more issue that is causing money losses on Ethereum ecosystem. In my opinion, nothing is hurting the adoption of the entire crypto industry more than the negative user experience and lost money. It seems to be the highest priority problem for me.

As I wrote earlier in [this article](https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic/comments/70sy2j/the_problem_of_calling_a_contract_on_the_wrong/), 5070 ETC got stuck inside the GNT contract address on ETC chain. Unfortunately, the Golem developers have lost the private key of their deployment account, which makes it impossible to extract funds and refund users with the specially designed [smart-contract](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/GNT-emergency-extractor-contract).

Here you can read Golem team response to my request: https://www.reddit.com/r/GolemProject/comments/71lrad/request_for_golem_developers_comments_58000_lost/

I've wrote the educational article about the problem as well: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/71q01k/warning_appeal_to_smartcontract_developers_wrong/

I'm planning to implement a set of additional checks on ClassicEtherWallet to address  this issue.

# 5. Promoting and community activity.

I've found it important to transcribe all the [Let's Talk ETC episodes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J35gvnA-L2c).

#### *Rationale:*

- I am not a native English speaker. I can read and write without problems, but speaking and listening is more problematic for me. I think that there are people like me. They are interested in ETC and they like to know more but watching 55 min videos is a real headache for us. As the result, I've found it important to have a written-down version of Let's Talk ETC since it represents a lot of useful information.

#### **Summary:**

I have hired a person to write down Let's Talk ETC dialogs. The result will be published on Ethereum Commonwealth github page as soon as it will be ready.

# 6. DexNS updates.

The detailed description of the latest DexNS updates can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic/comments/70mnx3/dexns_30_the_naming_service_that_will_facilitate/).

# 7. Preparing to protocol-level changes

[@yograterol](https://github.com/yograterol) has introduced an idea of launching a separate blockchain based on the modified version of Ethereum protocol.

#### *Rationale:*

- We are now ready to investigate the smart-contract based self-sustaining blockchain governance system. The proposed implementation doesn't require significant protocol changes and can be easily implemented in Ethereum CLassic protocol if necessary.


#### **Update summary:**

It is planned to launch a ""Callisto network"", a blockchain based on the modified version of Ethereum protocol. The blockchain will have a smart-contract based treasury system. A portion of the Callisto token emission will be allocated to the treasury smart-contract at protocol level.",NA,"72ccj7",NA,0,NA,"false",1507597577,"false","self","t5_3fgtx","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/EthereumClassic/comments/72ccj7/ethereum_commonwealth_development_update_25_sep/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

Update summary:

#### ECNS is holding bid funds in special `Deed` contracts.

1. Added a special event that will be emitted at the creation of each Deed contract.

2. Each Deed contract will become ""stale"" after 67500 blocks from the moment of its creation. During this time, the user can create a new auction to extract his funds from the sealed bid. After 9 days anyone can destroy the stale Deed.

3. Anyone can destroy stale Deed. The user that destroyed it will receive 5% of the bid value. 95% will go to Ethereum Commonwealth revenue address.

#### This approach improves the following aspects:

1. Easier to track by third party interfaces since each Deed will emit events on creation.

2. Incentivizes users to clear stale Deeds.

3. ECNS doesn't rely on block timestamp unlike the ENS. ECNS will rely on blocks number (67500 in this case). This approach is safer because miner can artificially manipulate block timestamp to extract 5% of the high bid value if the reward will be attractive enough. As for block number, miner can not affect it.

#### A new version of ECNS Hash Registrar is currently deployed here on Rinkeby testnet: https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xb93d8610e5efae1c7f7bcb5c65cfb58c3346ed0d

We've recently added an [Ethereum Classic Pool](https://poolmining.org/pool/etc) to our [Site](https://poolmining.org)

**Stratum Ports**

* stratum+tcp://etc.poolmining.org:3076	(GPU Mining, Vardiff)
* stratum+tcp://etc.poolmining.org:3077	(High-End Multi GPU Mining, Vardiff)

**Miner Configuration**

* Claymore Miner: Add the -esm 3 command line switch
* Genoil's Miner: Add the -SP 2 command line switch

**Summary**

* Pool address: [https://poolmining.org/pool/etc](https://poolmining.org/pool/etc)
* Runs on dedicated hardware (Dual Xeons, 128 GB RAM)
* Pool Fee: 0% (introductory offer)
* Payout System: PPLNS
* Payouts: Hourly
* Minimum Payout: 0.15 ETC
* Beginner friendly support on [UserEcho](http://feedback.poolmining.org/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/coinfoundryorg)

The pool is still very young and has been primarily tested by friends &amp; family over the recent weeks. Nowadays its become quite difficult for younger pools to convince miners to join a new pool with an unproven track-record and much lower hashrate than the established pools. To make it clear, our team is not interested in making a quick profit and then closing up shop at the first sign of trouble as it happened with many other newcomer pools. We are in this for the long run. By joining the pool, you are not only supporting pool itself but the Ethereum Classic-Ecosystem as a whole by helping to decentralize the distribution of hashing-power.

If you have questions or suggestions, feel free to drop me a line here or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/coinfoundryorg) or join the pool's [Support-Channel](http://feedback.poolmining.org/).

We, the Guarda team, has recently reached an important milestone in the crypto-industry. Please check out Guarda - our brand new secure wallet (with a secure private key) where you can have access to all of the tokens you own connected to the wallet address. https://guarda.co

Now it is easier to take more control over your crypto-funds. To make things simpler, we added an option of buying the tokens directly from the app and transferring them to any wallet address on the blockchain, so you do not need to hassle around, buying coins using different platforms. 

You can download the wallet. Any feedback is greatly appreciated, cause we wanna upgrade the wallet, meeting needs of the Ethereum Classic community.

[ECNS HashRegistrar update](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Roadmap/issues/30).

#### *Problem that is solved by this project:*

- Prevents the burning of funds. Even unrevealed bids will not be completely lost now.

- This also incentivises users to stay tuned with ECNS. You can just pick up 5% of the Deed value if someone has left his bid unrevealed.

- Security improvements. ENS relies on `block.timestamp`, which is a potential security issue, since a miner can artificially affect the timestamp of a mined block. ECNS will rely on block number because the block number can not be directly affected by miners.

#### *Here you can track the progress:*

- [HashRegistrar source code](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/ECNS/blob/master/HashRegistrar.sol)

- [Proposal on github](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Roadmap/issues/30)

- [Vote results](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Roadmap/issues/32)

#### **Update summary:**

Updates were made to the Deed and HashRegistrar contracts of the ECNS. These changes will allow Deeds to ""expire"". The validity of each Deed expires approximately in 7 days after its deployment ([67500 blocks](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/ECNS/blob/master/HashRegistrar.sol#L142) is accurate. We are not relying on timestamp but on blocks number.).
Everyone will be allowed to call a special function at the Deed contract to destroy the expired Deed: `function destroyStaleDeed()`. The address of the caller will receive 5% of the Deed's funds to incentivise users to clear expired Deeds. 95% of Deed's funds would go to the Ethereum Commonwealth revenue destribution address.

New version of HashRegistrar smart-contract is currently deployed on testnet. The main HashRegistrar contract will be updated as soon as the final testing is completed.

# 2. Community activity: transcribing ""Let's Talk ETC"" episodes.

#### *Rationale:*

- Let's Talk ETC represents a lot of useful information about the Ethereum CLassic project, community members and development activity. Unfortunately, it is only available in audio format. I am not a native speaker of English, and I understand how difficult it is to listen to such information. I think that there are many such people like me, who can easily write and read and are interested in ETC. I think that it is important to transcribe ""Let's Talk ETC"" episodes to have them in written form for those who prefer to read. This will also allow us to translate it in many other languages easily a bit later.

#### *Here you can track the progress:*

- [Texts on Github](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/LetsTalkETC/tree/master/Episodes).

#### **Summary:**

The work is currently in progress. It is difficult to transcribe about 30 hours of oral speech, and many more improvements to formatting and readability are needed. I suppose that it will take at least one more month to bring the texts into a easy-to-read form.

# 3. [CLassicEtherWallet](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Roadmap/issues/30) updates.

#### *Rationale:*

- Maintaining the main ETC web wallet and online contract service.

#### *Here you can track the progress:*

- https://ethereumproject.github.io/etherwallet/

- [Ethereum Commonwealth Etherwallet repo](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/etherwallet)

- [Etherwallet improvements discussion](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Roadmap/issues/26) on Ethereum Commonwealth roadmap.

#### **Summary:**

9 of 12 main Etherwallet updates are currently implemented! 

We started to integrate DexNS into CEW. DexNS will significantly improve the scalability of CLassicEtherWallet since it allows to fully automate the process of interaction with ERC20/ERC223 tokens on ANY network including ETC, ETH, EXP, UBQ and any of Ethereum-compatible chains.You can now add token by it's symbol if it is registered on DexNS. Token ABI, decimals and everything else will be done automatically. Currently, this only works for ETC tokens.

There were many other updates. The most important of them are:

1. Network URL querying. You can now specify the network artificially. For example https://ethereumproject.github.io/etherwallet/?network=ETH#contracts will always redirect you to **ETH contracts** tab. https://ethereumproject.github.io/etherwallet/?network=ETC#send-transaction will always redirect you to unlock wallet tab on **ETC chain**.

2. CEW now displays multiple currency balances (ETC, ETH, EXP, UBQ simultaneously). I believe that we should educate users: ethereum account can hold all these currencies simultaneously. This will also help to avoid confusion when a user is complaining about the fact that he sent ETH into ETC account and visa versa. Now you will see all the currencies that your account has on the balance.

3. Automated contract details downloading by token contract address when adding tokens.

4. Added CLassicMask references and a link to CLassicMask extension. You can use CLassicEtherWallet with either MetaMask or CLassicMask.

5. A list of default tokens and contracts is updated. If you are contract developer and want your contract to be listed in list of ""Default ETC contracts"" on CEW feel free to contact me.

It is also planned to improve CEW security with additional checks to avoid such an accidents as [this situation with Golem](https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic/comments/70sy2j/the_problem_of_calling_a_contract_on_the_wrong/).

# 4. [CLassicMask](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/ClassicMask) maintenance.

#### *Rationale:*

- ClassicMask is an extension-wallet for storing Ether and an API provider for many services that needs to work with Ethereum protocol without running their own full node.

#### *Here you can track the progress:*

- [Github](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/ClassicMask/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed).

- [MetaMask port proposal](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Roadmap/issues/8) on Ethereum Commonwealth roadmap.

#### **Summary:**

ClassicMask is updated with the latest MetaMask patches. We are keeping Classic version of the extension-wallet up to date.

You can use ClassicMask wherever MetaMask is used. ClassicMask provides the same functionality and even more: it supports more networks and allows to adjust `GasPrice` and `GasLimit` manually to configure transaction details.

# 5. Smart-contract-based governance system.

#### *Rationale:*

- A network governed by a smart-contract can be an effective way to solve the problem of the lack of governance system of the ETC network and financing of further development. It could be a self-sustaining ecosystem once launched and properly configured. It has it's own downsides and benefits compared to other governance protocols.

#### *Here you can track the progress:*

- [Source code](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Treasury/blob/master/Treasury.sol)

#### **Summary:**

The work is currently in progress. This is an experimental prototype model right now. This contract can also be used as a local ""treasury"" for any project that requires a decentralized money flow distribution and a decentralized governance system. 

The key issue here is to establish a money flow to the smart-contract. Mining fees are often used as a solution of this issue in Treasury governance models.

# Raiden network.

The Raiden Network is an infrastructure layer on top of the Ethereum blockchain. The Raiden Network is an off-chain scaling solution for performing ERC20-compliant token transfers on the Ethereum blockchain.

I'm researching about opportunities of launching the similar service on top of Ethereum CLassic network to improve ETC scalability. It is also necessary to make it ERC223-compliant.

Raiden will be launched through ICO on Ethereum. I can say that I'm not planning to launch a separate ICO if it would be decided to port Raiden to ETC network. Currently, I'm in researching stage and I can not provide any more details about possibility and costs of porting this project to ETC.

#### Remark

All these projects are in active development stage. Any feedback, contributions and bug reports are always appreciated!

I often heard that it is a big issue that multisig wallets will not work with ERC223 tokens. I would like to briefly describe how this works.

In Ethereum contracts there is a fallback function. This is a special function that is executed whenever the `data` of the transaction not match any signature of a function that is implemented in this contract. All the Ether transactions are handled by fallback function. 

As for multisig wallets, they often use the `Deposit` event to log incoming transactions. In case of ERC223, a token contract will try to execute the `tokenFallback` function when depositing tokens into multisig wallet contract.

If the multisig wallet doesn't implement a `tokenFallback` function then the fallback function will be executed. As the result of this, transaction will successfully submit, but it would be logged as deposit of 0 Ether.

**You can deposit, store and transfer ERC223 tokens using any multisig wallet that allows deposits of 0 Ether**.

I have already modified the multisig wallet example to implement a proper logging of ERC223 deposits.

# Some Changes to Ethereum Classic

Bitnovosti has decided to take a step back from Ethereum Classic, this was always a part of their plan, get us setup, be our lightening rod, and then step back once we were
self sustaining. With 3 development teams, a passionate community, the ETC
Cooperative, our first summit, and wide exchange adoption I’d say we’re there.

I want to extend my sincere thanks to Bitnovosti for helping us keep the
original Ethereum blockchain alive when we all thought it was dead. Bitnovosti’s
contributions cannot be overstated. Our plan for passing the torch is outlined
below.

### What this article will cover

1.  A donation address containing [17.3k
ETC](https://gastracker.io/addr/0xe9a7e26bf5c05fe3bae272d4c940bd7158611ce9)
1.  Many domain names, including ethereumclassic (.com/.net/.org) and etctalk
(.com/.org)
1.  A news aggregator, [etc.today](http://etc.today/#/)
1.  Moderation (subreddits, Slack)

As a community we need to decide what to do with these resources and so we have
a plan that we want the community to evaluate this week. Please note we are
working against deadlines, discussion cannot drag out for weeks and months, the
longer these issues go unresolved the less likely they will be resolved. The
deadline for comments is Monday, December 4th, 2017.

[Comments can be submitted at this reddit
post](https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic/comments/7fvr2o/some_changes_are_coming_to_ethereum_classic_and/).

*****

### The Plan

#### Multi-sig Funds

We will be creating a multi-sig for temporary holding of funds until a better
solution can be found.

The following people will be signing on the multi-sig and we are awaiting
confirmation from others. We used two criteria to find signers: a long history
of contributions to Classic, and calm/reasoned decision making.

Current signers: Myself, Elaine, Cody, MikO

Awaiting confirmation: ETC Cooperative, snaproll, OmniEdge

We initially considered having one member of each development team on the
multi-sig. ETCDEV felt this would be a conflict of interest for them. To avoid
unbalanced influence between the development teams we’ve decided to not have any
development team signers. Ethereum Commonwealth agreed. We are waiting to hear
back from IOHK.

*Full disclosure: Elaine, Cody, and snaproll are ETCDEV “advisors”. Their
function in this roll is minimal and will not have any influence on their
decisions with regards to the funds.*

[Some of the
funds](https://gastracker.io/tx/0x38d8dda6ed65444762143215ff1c2742b8c16f312766415755661389b1a6198b)
in the donation account are direct from The DAO hacker’s address. The DAO hacker
sent them to the donation address a while back. We will not be administering
these funds and will ask bitnovosti to not send this 1k ETC to the multi-sig.

We plan to use this [simple multi-sig
code](https://github.com/etherisc/MultiSigSafe/blob/master/contracts/MultiSigSafe.sol)
(not final, will need to be updated for our signing addresses).

If needed we agree to use the funds only to pay for resources (ex. server
hosting). We will not take any actions without soliciting community feedback and
will not proceed if there’s strong opposition. We cannot personally profit in
any way from the use of these funds.

#### Domain administration

I will take control of the domains Bitnovosti previously had under their
control. They will all point where they currently do and I have no plans to
change this. I plan to point the EtcTalk domains at the server that [Yaz
Khoury](https://medium.com/@yazanator) is putting together with NinjaPool.

If a better approach arises, and the community supports it, I’m happy to
transfer some or all of the domains. At the end of the day though I want to
avoid any sort of bitcoin.com / bitcoin.org type of domain splitting that we’ve
seen elsewhere.

#### ETC.Today

Classic_Kevin will take over [ETC.Today](http://etc.today/#/) along with MikO
helping out as needed.

#### Slack/Subreddits

Bitnovosti transferred Slack ownership to me when they left. They also made me a
mod of /r/EthereumClassic and /r/EtcTrader. [Yaz
Khoury](https://medium.com/@yazanator) and Classic_Kevin are now also mods.

*****

### Closing Comments

Bitnovosti may have left but we are all still here and Classic is stronger than
ever. I look forward to Classic’s future and to the positives these changes will

Decentralized Naming Service for human-readable hex address representation and automated token support for third parties.","I've faced some problems working on DexNS UI implementation and I need a bit more time to resolve it.

As the result, DexNS UI launch will be included in the next ClassicEtherWallet patch. I suppose that it will take a couple more days.

The final version of DexNS UI will include:

1. Name registration interface.

2. Advanced interface for token developers to allow them to register their tokens.

3. Name terms of ownership extension.

4. Name management interface.

It was decided to extract the name browser to a separate program. This is not really possible to integrate the DexNS name support with current blockchain explorers and it requires lots of changes to their codebase.

We have prepared DexNS to the launch stage: all the token names (upper case symbols: `GNT`, `RDN`, `REP` etc.) are already registered. You can search ETC and ETH tokens by their DexNS names already. You can add custom token by it's DexNS name at [ClassicEtherWallet](http://classicetherwallet.com/) as well.

## DexNS name market.

[@samsepi0l](https://github.com/misterch0c/) wishes to create a smart-contract based DexNS marketplace for registered names. In the process of marketplace development it was discovered that DexNS contracts lacks event handling possibility in analogy to ERC20 token contracts. (Assuming that name ownership transfer is an event for DexNS and token transaction is an event for ERC20 token)

As the result, I will update DexNS contract in the near future to include the event handler function execution. None of the registered names will be affected. DexNS is a modular contract system which allows to update it without a requirement to re-register names after the update.

### There will be a bug bounty before launch.

https://github.com/ethereumclassic/Media_Kit


Recently a very small group worked with a very fine individual, Guabano, to put together a set of new branding proposals, seen here...

https://github.com/ethereumproject/phoenix-project 


BOTH are being pushed out as optional Official Branding.  This is confusing, and this is not how professional branding works.

Personally, I think the logos under Phoenix Project are just not something that should be used - ever.  I am not totally against the phoenix mascot, although I continue to believe that currencies just don't have mascots.  They have symbols *(logos)*

Before this gets out of hand I think some sort of vote should be undertaken to get a community concensus.  I have seen no real concensus that the new logos are better, or close to as good as the Original ETC Diamond.  I do not know how to do a poll or I would.  

**Part 1: I am calling for a community consensus on the logo/symbol** ......

**a)** We standardize on the Original ETC Diamond as the Brand Logo/Symbol

**b)** We standardize on the New Phoenix Logo Set as the Brand Logo/Symbol.  This set has 2 distinctive designs.  One is a fractalized design, and one is a diamond with ""ec"" in the middle.  

**c)** We back both of them, and anything anyone wants to use.  We define a *""decentralized chain""* as not having *""one consensus...telling another what they can or can't do""* (Quote by Pyskell).  In other words, we actually abandon attempts at governance by consensus and allow everyone to just do what they want without seeking community approval.  NOTE:  I can understand this for preparations of ECIPs and the like... but it seems that the ETC Brand should at least have some consistency.  And yes, I realize this is a bit of biased wording - but not everyone is a marketer, and the fact that this approach abandons all normalcy regarding marketing principles needs to be pointed out.


**Part 2 of the question is the Mascot**......

**a)** Yes, lets make the Phoenix the Official Mascot Design Set as shown in the Phoenix

**b)** No, we do not need an ""Official Mascot""

**c)** I am indifferent


**Part 3: In the event that people choose the original Logo, but also the New Mascot (not the new logos), that the Githubs should be merged into a new and singular updated Media Kit that reflects the new standards**.

**a)** Yes, Community Standards based on Consensus is good, clear and professional

**b)** No, I like the concept of decentralized anarchy as a new marketing standard",NA,"7go4tw",NA,0,NA,"false",1512328413,"false","self","t5_3fgtx","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/EthereumClassic/comments/7go4tw/marketing_vote_input_needed_we_have_2_competing/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

I have planned out a mining rig with 8 gpus(I had an rx580 in mind). I have a few  questions about the entire thing. Lastly I do not need to worry about power consumption as we don't not pay for the power.
1. Will I need more than one motherboard to use all of these gpus?
2. Secondly, what gpus would u guys recommend
3. Thirdly, what mining pool would be the best option for mining this.
4.lastly I am using luna is a bitcoin wallet right now, is it the best wallet to use, or are there better ones.

This is CoinGate. We are a cryptocurrency payment processor and we couldn’t be more glad about the growth and changes in this exciting new industry. 

However, we find it insufficient that many people are seeing cryptos like ETC as merely an asset. Despite the relatively low adoption of cryptocurrencies by merchants, our team is very positive about the future of cryptocurrencies for payments, and we are excited to offer our services to all the online merchants out there.

That is actually why we are reaching out to you, the people who have an honest interest in cryptocurrencies, their further development and real-world use cases. We want to let you know that we have integrated with ShapeShift, so, if you ever come across a merchant using CoinGate, you definitely can spend your ETC there. Moreover, we are constantly working on making it the payment process even smoother for our merchants.

Actually, if you are using ETC frequently and want to have the option to pay with it - we would be more that happy if you share it with your favourite merchants. And if you have any feedback or questions for CoinGate, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Regards, 
CoinGate

Why is it successful? Because when wealth grows, the currency which is meant to represent that wealth needs to grow with it. And wealth(a subjective human value) grows constantly in our society, historically at around 1-3% annualy.

A few options I have tried after searching on reddit/internet:

- Myetherwallet.com website (network: ETC). Unfortunately, when I try to select the mist multisignature contract, it does not show the contract and gives an error message. I have pasted the contract from another source, yet I still did not succeed (it moved more ETC from my wallet *into* the multi-sig wallet, I double-checked the wallet / multisig adresses, yet it still does this). 

- The ETC mist wallet does not sync with peers / update.

- I also tried to install parity, run it in classic mode, and use the ETH mist wallet on top of it. Yet it downloaded the ETH chain.

I feel like I have exhausted my options.

I believe that all readers have met Ethereum addresses or ""Ethereum accounts"" in various forms. 

1. We all have seen hex addresses like `0x12300b5fe614110012300631d7ff070180004321`.

2. There are password protected ""keystore json UTC files"" that you can unlock in ClassicEtherWallet or MyEtherWallet to access your account. 

3. You can also see password-protected accounts in MetaMask.

4. Hardware wallets also store and allow access to your Ethereum address.

5. There were ""Parity phrases"" that allows to access your account somehow but I didn't ever used it.

As you can see there are plenty of different possibilities to store and access your accounts. They seem to be different, but there is one detail that you should know: **your Ethereum account is your private key and nothing more.**

# Some technical descriptions

Ethereum account = private key. Your hex address that you will see on the blockchain is generated from your private key. 

Each 64-character string (besides 64 zeros) is considered a valid private key for Ethereum network. And there is one address associated with each private key.

Private keys are not really ""generated"". Private keys always exist and wait for someone to pick up one of them and start using it. Nothing is written to blockchain when you click ""generate wallet""  and no wallet is really generated. The service that provides ""wallet generation functionality"" will just pick one of private keys (generate 64 random hexadecimal characters that would serve you as private key) and represent it to you.

There is a constant algorithm for extracting the address from the private key, which always extracts one address and only this address from a certain private key.

I wrote a small program that illustrates the process of extracting an address from any 64-character string (potential private key):

https://dexaran.github.io/KeyExtractor/

NOTE: hex address is not a public key. Address is first 20 bytes of Keccak-256 hash of account's public key.

# How this different accounts work

All these accounts represent your private key in different forms. For example keystore JSON file is an encrypted version of your private key. *Keystore file password is only required to unencrypt your private key*. Password is not required to send transactions or operate with your account, it's an extraneous detail that was specially introduced to improve the security of your funds.

Hardware wallet stores your private key and extract your address from it each time you want to see it.

MetaMask stores your private key also.

# IMPORTANT: Some effects that you should be aware of

As the algorithm for extracting of an address from a private key is exactly the same on Ethereum, Ethereum Classic and any of the Ethereum-based networks (Expanse, UBQ, PIRL) it is also possible to use your private key on any of this networks and it will result in exactly the same address.

**Education #1: You can use one address on multiple chains.**

Smart-contract addresses are generated from sender address and transaction nonce. 

**Education #2: It is possible to create a couple of smart-contracts with same addresses on different chains.**

You can also give someone your address on any of the Ethereum-based chains since you can access your own address with your private key on different chains and it will be exactly the same address on any of the Ethereum-based chains. This means that you can give your ENS name as the recipient addres and successfully receive ETC, UBQ or any other currency using your ""myethereumaddress.eth"" name.

**Education #3: You can use ENS names on multiple chains.**",NA,"7ctsen",NA,0,NA,"false",1512254694,"false","self","t5_3fgtx","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/EthereumClassic/comments/7ctsen/some_user_education_about_ethereum_addresses/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

Next CEW update.","We are glad to announce that the next ClassicEtherWallet release is coming soon. It will include the initial DexNS name registration tab.

## What is DexNS?

DexNS is a decentralized smart-contract based naming service which solves two problems for Ethereum Classic and the whole Ethereum ecosystem:

1. Addresses readability by providing human-friendly names.

2. Automatisation of token support for third party services by providing contract ABIs and metadata.

At the initial stage, ClassicEtherWallet UI will only provide a human-readable name registration for addresses. Token contract registration is coming with the next release.

The importance of ensuring the convenience of reading addresses in cryptocurrency systems is now obvious. The newest structures already offer their solutions: [ENS](https://ens.domains/), [AEternity](https://github.com/aeternity/aeternity-reimagined/blob/master/name-system.md) etc.

DexNS is designed to be a crosschain naming service thus solving the problem for the whole Ethereum ecosystem, not only ETC. You can register a DexNS name and use it on any Ethereum-compatible chain: ETH, ETC, UBQ, EXP, PIRL or even testnet.

## How do I register a name?

You can directly register a name if you call the [DexNS_Frontend](https://gastracker.io/addr/0x5e9b151eb9742c20679e1d96e5c3633678cab724) contract (`registerName` function).

You can also run the newer version of CEW from the source code: https://github.com/Dexaran/etherwallet

This will provide you a special ""DexNS"" tab. Click ""I'm a user and I want to register a name"" button, unlock your wallet, pick a name and submit a transaction.

## Is it free?

This is the initial version, and it is still free. I will update the DexNS contract soon 
 and launch a bugbounty. After that, each name will cost 0.25 ETC by default or what price the name holder will put on the name market.

## How it works?

I have registered my e-mail as DexNS name: `dexaran820@gmail.com`

Go to [ClassicEtherWallet](https://ethereumproject.github.io/etherwallet/?network=ETC#send-transaction) send transaction tab and type this e-mail into the ""To"" address input. This will resolve the name to my address.

Don't like ETC? Switch to the ETH node at the top right corner and type the e-mail again. The name will work on both chains.",NA,"7epo1e",NA,0,NA,"false",1512291696,"false","self","t5_3fgtx","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/EthereumClassic/comments/7epo1e/ethereum_commonwealth_announces_dexns_ui_launches/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

You can now use human-readable names on ETH, ETC, UBQ, EXP, MusiCoin and test-net chains.","# ClassicEtherWallet now supports DexNS names.

DexNS allows to register human-readable names that could be resolved into Ethereum hex-addresses. Currently, names are free. You can own your name within 1 year after the moment of registration. You can extend name ownership after the certain amount of time will pass. DexNS provides names in human-readable text format. DexNS contract allows any names of any lengths and any characters, but third party services such as ClassicEtherWallet may filter confusing characters and weird names. As the result, it is not recommended to register names with whitespaces and names ending in ENS tld resolutions ( .eth / .etc / .reverse ). You can register your e-mail address as Name for example ( `dexaran820@gmail.com` ). *Any user will be able to send ETH, ETC, EXP, UBQ, MUSICOIN and testnet Ether to your address that is assigned to the registered name* via ClassicEtherWallet.

(1) Yes, you can use one DexNS Name on multiple chains to receive different currencies such are ETH, ETC, EXP, UBQ.

(2) Yes, you can store multiple currencies in one Ethereum wallet address.

For example I have registered `dexaran` as my address name. DexNS contracts are only deployed on ETC chain. I can switch to ETH node and unlock the wallet to send ETH. Then I can type a `dexaran` keyword into ""To Address"" input box at CLassicEtherWallet and it will successfully find my address that is registered on another chain in fact. 

I can send and receive transactions using this address and this name without any problems.

## Registering a Name for a contract

DexNS allows to register a Name and assign it to a contract. In most usual case, contracts are ERC-20/ERC-223 tokens. DexNS facilitates searches for tokens on different chains. Each Name contain a special metadata field where you can specify token network. Metadata specification can be found in [DexNS github repo](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/DexNS).

As the result, we can now search for all the registered tokens on any chain and fully automate a process of adding new tokens to ClassicEtherWallet. This significantly improves scalability in terms of support of custom tokens unlike MEW that adds each token manually.

## Preventing user mistakes

DexNS allows to filter and prevent some mistakes that could not be prevented earlier because we now know the network of each token contract. This allows to prevent accidental attempts to execute a contract that is deployed on one of the alternative chains in fact.

The next step is to develop a user-friendly interface that allows users and developers of smart contracts to easily register personal Names and Names for tokens.

### Reminder
Warning! This is still an early version of the software. I will not recommend to transfer huge amounts of funds by Names unless you fully understand what you are doing.",NA,"7b0rak",NA,0,NA,"false",1512219280,"false","self","t5_3fgtx","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/EthereumClassic/comments/7b0rak/dexns_cew_updates_you_can_now_use_humanreadable/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

The eco system, principles, and institutional support is there, but people don’t notice because bitcoin and Ethereum have all the attention.


Look back to this post in 3 years when ETC is over $5000 a piece.

# FAQ
### Will the upcoming ECIP-1017 fork create free coins?
No. As of late it has become fashionable for Bitcoin to fork and create ""free coins"" out of thin air. This will not be the case with ECIP-1017. This is simply an upgrade that 95%+ of the machines running on the ETC network support. This update strengthens ETC, giving us a known monetary supply. If you'd like to read more about it [click here](https://github.com/ethereumproject/ECIPs/blob/master/ECIPs/ECIP-1017.md).

### When will the ECIP-1017 fork occur?
On December 11th, 2017 when the ETC network reaches block 5 million.

### Is Classic anti-Ethereum?
No, of course not. We disagree on some things but many of our members consider themselves members of other blockchain communities including Ethereum.

### I hear ETC is pro-hacker, is that true?
No, not at all. The core tenent of ETC is that we don't undo the past and we don't retroactively change rules on our blockchain. All changes can only occur on future blocks when everyone is informed of the rules ahead of time so they can make their own decisions on their involvement with ETC. We believe the long-term benefits of this approach far outweigh the negatives.

### Is there an ETC Foundation?
ETC aims to be decentralized, to this end we have three independent dev teams ([ETCDEV](https://www.etcdevteam.com/), [IOHK](https://iohk.io/projects/ethereum-classic/), and [Ethereum Commonwealth](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth)) . We also have the [Ethereum Classic Cooperative](https://etccooperative.org/) which helps fund ETC-based projects.

### Will ETC never hardfork?
We have, can, and will continue to make hardforks when they benefit our community and do not risk splitting it apart. 

Hardforks typically offer improvements to the network, and when they're not contentious the community stays together. Without them we would be unable to make many types of improvements. So yes, Classic has, and will continue to create hardforks when necessary and when community agreement is high. One example of this is the upcoming hardfork that makes changes to our [monetary policy](https://github.com/ethereumproject/ECIPs/blob/master/ECIPs/ECIP-1017.md), [another one delayed our difficulty bomb](https://github.com/ethereumproject/ECIPs/blob/master/ECIPs/ECIP-1010.md).

After lots of fruitless searching, I hope to find a solution here. I own [redacted] and have the 12 keywords. How can I access the ETC in this account? I do not have a json file or the like.

The rules of this game are pretty simple:

Blocks on the bottom layer cost 0.005 ETC. Blocks on each next layer cost twice as much:

* Layer 1: 0.005 ETC

* Layer 2: 0.01 ETC

* Layer 3: 0.02 ETC

* Layer 4: 0.04 ETC

* etc...

When someone places a block on top of yours, you get half the value from their block. So, when one block has been placed on top of yours, you've made your money back. When two blocks have been placed on top of yours, you've doubled your money!

There's a 0.5% fee per block placed.

An interesting aspect of this game is that you never actually definitively lose. Either you win soon, or you wait a while longer until you win.

The contract address and source code are the same on both the ETH and ETC blockchains: 0xC3c94e2d9A33AB18D5578BD63DfdaA3e0EA74a49

Yesterday, 12-7-2017, a hostile takeover of the ETCisComing social media accounts took place by founder David Hopkins. I, Kevin Lord, entered into an agreement with Mr. Hopkins, declaring the accounts where rightfully his, and that no interference of the password was to take place. 

ETCisComing officially began in late July, just as then community manager Carlos Graterol, made his departure. This began as a feat to re-engage social media promotion in several different platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook, and ETCisComing.com. 

I, Kevin Lord, worked day in day out, crafting social media content for 4+ months, not once receiving any assistance (financial or any other) from Mr. Hopkins aka KeepDoing. I rejected the idea of being compensated at first, due to the fact that I cared more about the community and its re-engagement. It looks like I succeeded. 

Over the past 4 months the total active users grew exponentially from 10 to 150 to 400 and today the 7th of December we past 3,000 followers. ETC also now averages around 300 tweets per day, added 1500 new members to the official Twitter (@eth_classic), and have added about 1500 more to the Reddit platform. Its very unfortunate that this wonderful campaign has to come to such an abrupt, and irresponsible end, but it was out of my control.

[DexNS UI](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Roadmap/issues/30) added at ClassicEtherWallet.

#### *Problem that is solved by this project:*

- DexNS turns hard-to-remember hex addresses into human-friendly text names..

- DexNS tab at ClassicEtherWallet allows to register names with a couple of clicks without a need to call the contract directly..

- DexNS allows to register a Name instantly. This means that it is possible to register a DexNS name from the third party smart-contract (ENS does not allow it).

#### *Here you can track the progress:*

- [Etherwallet github repo](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/etherwallet)

#### **Update summary:**

[DexNS tab](https://ethereumproject.github.io/etherwallet/?network=ETC#dexns) is already added to ClassicEtherWallet. *Warning!* DexNS is currently running in free mode. All the names are fee free but we need to update the DexNS smart-contract before the final launch. It is planned to transfer all names to the final version of DexNS but it is possible that names will be wiped before contract upgrade.

# 2. DexNS smart-contracts update.

#### *Here you can track the progress:*

- [DexNS bug bounty announcement](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Roadmap/issues/33).

- [Bug report history](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/DexNS/issues).

#### *Rationale:*

- Smart-contract hacking is a great problem of Ethereum (Classic). It is absolutely impossible to create a complex system of smart contracts without a single mistake on the first attempt. 

TheDAO was hacked, ENS launch fails with two critical mistakes in the code, Parity multisig was hacked twice, Augur (REP) suffers smart-contract issues at launch as well.

It is absolutely necessary to launch a bug bounty before final release of a smart-contract. Even if the smart contract contains only a couple of lines of code.

#### **Summary:**

DexNS is currently under bug bounty. No major issues were reported. 2 important improvements were considered. As the result, it was decided to upgrade the DexNS smart-contracts before the final launch.

DexNS bug bounty will end at December 10, 2017.

Payments schedule:

- $8500 for critical issue report.

- $2000 for security vulnerability or minor bug report.

- $100-500 for not a bug, but suggestions for improving the code.

Feel free to participate: https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Roadmap/issues/33

# 3. [Callisto Network](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/go-callisto) testnet launched.

#### *Rationale:*

- The main goal of Callisto is to research and develop a reference implementation of a completely financial transparent, self-funded, self-governed, open to contribute, innovation-friendly blockchain based development environment. Possibly apply this model for Ethereum Classic if the project will succeed.

#### *Here you can track the progress:*

- [Source code on github](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/go-callisto).

#### **Summary:**

Callisto is currently in development stage. This project represents a separate blockchain based on Byzantium compatible go-ethereum source code. Callisto will have a fixed supply of 6,500,000,000 CLO.

A portion of CLO emission will directly go to the Callisto developers to fund a further development. I believe that financial transparency is one of the key points of any project.

# 4. [ECNS hash registrar update](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/ECNS).

#### *Here you can track the progress:*

- [ECNS commit history](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/ECNS/commits/master).

#### **Summary:**

Hash registrar contract was successfully updated according to the [proposal #30](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Roadmap/issues/30).

# 5. Decentralized Token Exchange (Radex).

#### *Problem that is solved by this project:*

- Lack of decentralized token exchange for Ethereum CLassic tokens.

#### *Read more about Radex:*

- [ERC223 token exchange](https://rados.io/posts/announcing-radex-decentralized-erc223-exchange).

- [ERC223 &amp; ERC20](https://rados.io/posts/advantages-of-erc223-tokens).

#### **Summary:**

I had a conversation with a Radex developer recently and now I'm happy to announce that Rados.io is going to launch the first decentralized ERC223-token exchange. Radex will be launched on both ETC and ETH networks.

As the result, we will have a decentralized exchange for ERC223 ETC tokens soon.

# 6. Ethereum Classic messaging system.

#### *Problem that is solved by this project:*

- Lack of possibility to contact the owner of the address on the ETC network.

#### *Here you can track the progress:*

- [Github repo](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/CEW-message-system).

#### **Summary:**

One of the main problems of Ethereum (and other cryptocurrency) networks is that you can't contact an address owner. 

Imagine that you have sent 30 ETC to someone's address by mistake. You want to contact him and say: ""Hey, this was a mistake. Please, send my ETC back"".

Imagine that you spotted that someone has deployed a Parity multisig. You want to contact him and say: ""Hey, this contract is insecure. Do not store your money there"".

Imagine that someone ~~hacked TheDAO~~ hacked some contract. You want to contact him and say something.

You can not directly send a recognizable message to any owner of any address. I'm aiming to solve this problem. The conception is to create a special smart-contract that will allow to send messages and store messages for address owners. Then I will connect this service with ClassicEtherWallet and ClassicMask to display this messages when someone unlocks his wallet.

We can not guarantee that the address owner will find out about the message sent to him even with this smart contract, but the more adoption the ETC Message System will get, the more likely the message will be delivered successfully.

In addition, I can say that the experiment to create a crosschain service succeeded  (DexNS works on crosschain basis). We can now solve a problem of lack of messaging system with a Crosschain Ethereum Classic Message Service and make ETC a core part of this service.

# 7. Crosschain token swap protocol.

#### *Rationale:*

- Develop a reference implementation of crosschain token swap protocol.

#### *Here you can track the progress:*

- [Token swap smart-contract](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/ETC-ETH-token-swaps/blob/master/TokenSwap.sol) source code.

#### **Summary:**

Token swap protocol development is currently in progress. This project represents a system of smart-contracts that will serve as ""swap channel"" for crosschain token exchanges.

There are two contracts: channel contract and channel manager. Channel contract is deployed once someone wants to exchange tokens while manager contract serves to prove channel contract validity. Participants could set up a couple of swap channel contracts via the channel manager to exchange, say 10 DEX to 5 GNT. One channel contract will lock DEX tokens on ETC chain and another contract will lock GNT tokens on ETH chain. The first participant will be allowed to withdraw GNT tokens once contracts are created and tokens are locked. If the GNT withdrawal will be cryptographically proven then the second participant will be allowed to withdraw DEX tokens from the first contract.

You can read [in this interview](https://medium.com/@cseberino/conversation-with-the-dao-attacker-dexaran-speaks-11d747a43083) Dexaran denied that he is the Dao hacker.

You can also browse recently deployed [dexNS contracts repo](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/DexNS/) and find out the address [0x101f1920e4cd9c7e2af056e2cb1954d0dd9647b9](https://gastracker.io/addr/0x101f1920e4cd9c7e2af056e2cb1954d0dd9647b9) that is deployed from [0xc9bea9379a8fade01240ee583535fac713b71014](http://gastracker.io/addr/0xc9bea9379a8fade01240ee583535fac713b71014) account. This account is still mentioned as dexns owner inside the contract. We have all reasons to conclude that its Dexarans account address.

Here you can see a transaction http://gastracker.io/tx/0xbbe638385ade5f7610a861ed3e52568ab01de34a6761ef376f3fbb847244b26f 

This is a transaction between Dexarans acount and 0x085acc2d9794fc82e88b9b7b561ac3fea56406a9 account which is recognized as DAO hacker's address.

If you look at [0x085acc2d9794fc82e88b9b7b561ac3fea56406a9](http://gastracker.io/addr/0x085acc2d9794fc82e88b9b7b561ac3fea56406a9) address transaction history you can see that a transaction between this address and Dexarans one is still one of the last transactions of this account (it was not touched since November 2016).

Dexaran is using many different addresses. You can review his financial report and you will see that he is creating a new address each time he need to receive payment. The Dao hacker acts exactly the same. He spammed many different accounts.

If you review an old history of 0xc9bea9379a8fade01240ee583535fac713b71014 account you can find some other transactions between this address and addresses that were in contact with Dao hackers address. It is hard to recover the full transaction history now and Dexaran is not rushing to develop a new blockchain explorer to solve this issue, isn't it? May be he has some reasons to hold block explorer development for uncertain timeframe.

If you review commit history of Dexarans github profile you will see that he is mostly a smart-contract developer with a knowledge in solidity. The Dao hacker hacked a smart-contract.

There seem to not be so much chatter here compared to other coins. Is it because the amount of people is just that much smaller, less good of a prospect concerning the coin or simply everyone is busy improving the tech around the coin? :) 

I actually bought in with Ethereum Classic, I can’t say that the decision was incredibly well founded but I read up about the history of the coin, reason for fork and some of the development - and all in all it just felt good which is why I went in. (Also the community while quiet seemed “‘mature” unlike some btc:ers.

Anyway, interested in hearing thoughts of 2018. Except comments like “to the moon” and “hodl” what do we expect to see? Soaring prices? New implementations and tech? It’s a “small” coin, do we have any chances of making a really good impact?

as you have seen Ripple, Litecoin and Ethereum have all pumped phenomenally. Why? Because of capital flows. Coinbase is the first port of call for many investors trying to get in. This is now reflected in the price of Litecoin at a staggering $300. When Vinny Lingham (Civic CEO and Investor on SharkTank) was tweeted if LTC would reach $75- he said 'not in my life-time'. What a load of bollocks. 

The question remains, why in the hell is the original Ethereum Chain (Ethereum Classic) not on Coinbase? 
we as a community need to fix this blatant slap in the face and Tweet Brian Armstrong, politley asking him to list ETC. If they do we could see ETC reach $250 with ease- thats 10x!
We lost to fucking NAV on his poll in Jan (14304). only 566 of us voted for ETC.: https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/816078749963694080?lang=en

I have put in more than 50% of my crypto holdings into ADA. I hope it will grow, but I notice that I am equally excited about how Cardano may truly change money/society over the long term. If they succeed, I am wondering what role other cryptocurrencies, like ETC, will play.

I started getting interested in Ethereum classic because I noticed that IOHK, the same team behind Cardano, was part of the development team. 

This will likely reveal some ignorance on my part, but why would Ethereum classic need to exist if Cardano succeeds in achieving its goals? Could Cardano not just as easily be used for IoT? Could it not just as easily be used for smart contracts? Could it not just as easily be used as a store of value?

First off, sorry if this is not exactly the place to post this.

I have an early Ethereum wallet that, due to the fork, turned into a wallet in both blockchains.

I have downloaded the recommended ETC classic wallet Chrome add-on as suggested in the Classic official site and thru it sent my ETC, after an initial test, to my Ethereum Classic Wallet in Exodus.

http://gastracker.io/addr/0xeD6eEc268f0a8483d2762F6A923bbA95F14B9120

However, that same second transaction was cloned in the other blockchain.

https://etherscan.io/address/0xed6eec268f0a8483d2762f6a923bba95f14b9120

It allows artists to tokenize their tracks, sell music tokens to fans and investors, grant commercial licenses for their music via integrated licensing marketplace and automatically receive royalties, distributed among all holders of track tokens via smart-contracts. 

Users of the platform can invest in music and become co-owners of tracks by purchasing track tokens, thus being entitled to receive a share of all royalties from track licensing and to participate in track governance by voting with their track tokens. 

All of the transactions in the system are made in Musereum tokens - ETM - that will be available for purchasing at selected exchanges, via fiat gateway from our website or directly from us during the token sale.

Artists and other platform users will be able to get necessary services from third-party providers (rights-clearing, promotion, video production, etc.) that can be paid for with ETM.

In order to gain public recognition, as well as to attract artists to our platform, a streaming solution - Soundchain - will enable private users to stream music from the platform free of charge, while every time the music is listened to, holders of track tokens will receive remuneration in ETM from the platform.
Our project will operate on a five-sided market, uniting artists, investors, service providers, business users and listeners in one ecosystem.

**Why are we doing this?**

We can help music industry overcome several major problems.

**It is difficult to find information on who owns what - and that makes it harder to use music without infringing someone?s copyright.**

Our blockchain being a unified database with the immutable history of all transactions will provide automatically updated information on the attribution of rights.

**Transactions of all kinds (money, rights, licenses, etc.) within the industry are rarely transparent - and that creates incentive for fraudulent behaviour.**

A blockchain solution makes it possible to make all of the transactions transparent and verifiable - and that makes fraudulent behaviour unreasonable.

**Lots of interconnected intermediaries with complex relations between them makes it hard for rights holders to manage and control their IP.**

Use of smart-contracts and automation eliminates some of the links in the value while providing a unified and versatile tool for rights holders to 

**Since the structure is complex and obscure, a lot of value is lost - undistributed royalties end up in black boxes, uncleared rights can be neither assigned not licensed.**

With the databases of the granted licenses and of the rights holders entitled to royalties from these licenses, distributing royalties and clearing rights will become a routine task.

**Complicated value chains make monetizing music hard, because distribution of royalties can take years - so those who are able to pay advances obtain power over artists.**

Smart-contracts automatically and instantly distributes royalties among all the token holders, eliminating the monetization lag inherent in the current system.

Furthermore, the crowdinvesting option enables artists to raise funds by sharing their rights with fans and investors - similar to record label deals, but on artist's conditions.

**The market power of the majors make for an oligopolic market, where individual artists are forced to enter into highly restraining deals in order to get paid and be promoted.**

By creating a marketplace for service providers accepting ETM tokens, we enable artists to directly request only the services they need - be it promotion, video production or managerial advice - and stay independent from majors until they make a free and informed choice to ask for a specific service.

**Most of the players in the industry utilize ancient approaches to every aspect of the business - endless approvals and tons of paperwork make negotiations lengthy and expensive.**

Although the structure of relations may remain as complex as participants choose it to be, traceable transactions and unified voting mechanics facilitate negotiations among network participants and provides for easier governance experience.

Thus we believe that our project can greatly increase efficiency for most music industry participants, re-enabling competition in the music market and, as a side effect, creating secondary market for IP rights.

**How does the system operate?**

On the technical side we have a separate blockchain based on Ethereum that utilize a Proof-of-Authority consensus mechanism similar to that implemented by Oracles.org. We use technology developed by Parity and by Oracles Network, as well as our own developments.

Two types of tokens exist within the system - the main token, ETM, that is used as an internal currency for all of the transactions within the system, and track tokens that represent shares in IP rights for a specific track.

Track tokens will be generated for each track uploaded to the platform and will be distributed among rights holders according to the metadata provided by the uploader. These tokens can be further distributed by the rights holders, who will thereby assign a proportional share of the IP rights belonging to them to the new token holder.

A token holder or a group of token holders that own 100% of tokens for a specific track constitute a DAL - a decentralized autonomous label.  All of the royalties paid through the system are automatically distributed among DAL members according to the number of track tokens they hold at the time the royalty is being paid. If a member of a DAL license the music through traditional channels and the royalties are paid in fiat money, he is legally obliged to transmit a share of the royalty proportional to a share of the track tokens held by the other members of the DAL to the bank account of the Musereum operating company, that will use this money to buy ETM tokens and will distribute them among all of the other holders of track tokens. Members of the DAL can vote for specific use of the track and possible licensing terms via the Voting Dapp with the number of votes proportional to the number of tokens they hold. 

ETM token will be used as the main internal currency - to buy music tokens and invest in music ICOs, to pay for licenses at the licensing marketplace and to pay industry professionals for the services they render.

A fixed amount of 250,000,000 ETM tokens is generated with the launch of the platform, and additional 25,000,000 ETM will be generated every year.

   * PRO TIPS: If you are planning to hold your $ETC on Binance, add Google Authenticator 2FAC (check your security settings on Binance to add this)

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Limit order: you specify how much of the asset (in this case ETC) you want to buy or sell, and the price you want. If there are matching orders on the book (e.g. someone who wants to sell at the same price, or lower, as the price at which you want to buy), your order will be filled immediately. If not, your order will stay on the book until matching orders arrive (which could be never). (It is also possible for a limit order to be only partially filled) 

* Market order: you only specify how much of the asset you want to trade. Your order is then filled immediately at the best price currently available on the market. For instance, if you place a market buy order, you will be matched with the current lowest-priced sell order on the book. If that order is not large enough to completely fill yours, the next-lowest sell order will be used to fill some more of yours, and so on.

Here is the source code of messaging contract: https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Address-to-Address-messaging

This contract solves the problem of impossibility to contact the address owner without knowing anything other than his address.

Ethereum lacks a central messaging system that will allow to contact an address owner directly. As the result there is no viable way to deliver a message to address owner directly.

This service is useful in some circumstances, for example:

1. **You sent someone a token, the existence of which this person does not know.** It is likely that a person will spot an incoming ETH transaction, but there is no way that a person will spot an incoming token transaction or the fact that his balance of this token increases. You need to contact the owner of this address and ask to send your tokens back.

2. **You sent ETC into someone's ETH address.** The same situation as with tokens. It is likely that a person will not recognize an incoming transaction of an alternative currency. But he definitely can access it and send it back (or just go and sell it).

3. **You spotted that someone have deployed a contract that is proven to be vulnerable.** If you're a good guy then you want to contact an owner of the ""vulnerable contract"" and warn him that he is going to use a contract that contains vulnerability and his funds are at risk in this case.

4. **You spotted that someone has hacked something.** You would like to contact a hacker and kindly ask him to send everything back but the hacker likely will not respond if you will try to contact him via forums. I suppose that it is the most important case. On-chain methods of communication are the only way to securely contact a hacker or to respond if you are the hacker.

## How to use

### Access contract

Currently, there is a messaging smart-contract deployed: [0x076FbFC62503B59c3828D4E2BFF195a249cd055c](https://gastracker.io/contract/0x076FbFC62503B59c3828D4E2BFF195a249cd055c)

Here is an ABI: [message_contract.minified.abi](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Address-to-Address-messaging/blob/master/ABI/message_contract.minified.abi)

You can also access it via [ClassicEtherWallet contracts tab](https://ethereumproject.github.io/etherwallet/?network=ETC#contracts). Select ""Select Existing Contract"" dropdown menu and click `Address-To-Address message system`. It will load proper contract address and ABI automatically.

### Sending a message

Click ""Select a function"" dropdown menu and click `sendMessage` function. Enter the address to which you want to deliver the message into ""_to"" field and your message text into ""_text"" field. WARNING! This requires significant amount of gas. I will recommend to set the GasPrice to 1 GWei. I will not recommend to use this message service to deliver messages until it is necessary to contact an owner of a certain address but you don't know who he is and how to send him a message.

### Reading your messages

Message history is immutable. It will stay at the blockchain forever. You can always read a message even if it was sent 1000 years ago.

You can access the last message for a certain address. Select the `getLastMessage` function and type the address. Click ""READ"" button and the text of the last message will be displayed. This will display the sender of the message as well.

If you need to display previous message then you can select `getMessageByIndex` and input an index (start with `0`) and the desired address.

### Encrypting your messages.

Encryption of messages is provided in this contract. Unfortunately, you can't encrypt messages on-chain. The solution is to use asymmetric encryption.

If you want to allow people to send you private messages, then you can publish your public key in the contract. Select `setPublicKey` and input the key. Do not forget to input the key type as well. For example I'm using PGP public key/ Version: OpenPGP.js v2.0.0 .

You should select `getPublicKey` function and it will display you a public key of the address. It is likely that the none addresses except of mine has any public keys published. This is just a trial contract, which can solve this problem for the first time. WARNING: Key publishing requires a lot of gas. My key have consumed 1 500 000 gas. Getting someone else's public key is free.

Encrypt message off-chain with a public key and send an encrypted message like you send a normal one.

I know that the default CEW key representation is awful so I'd like to publish my key here: https://github.com/Dexaran/MyPublicKey/blob/master/PGP_KEY.txt

REMINDER: This is a trial version of the contract.

I'm planning to establish a UI to send/ receive/ display/ encrypt/ decrypt messages with ClassicEtherWallet and propose this update to MyEtherWallet.",NA,"7n2a83",NA,0,NA,"false",1515394852,"false","self","t5_3fgtx","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/EthereumClassic/comments/7n2a83/addresstoaddress_message_system_based_on/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

Feedback?","Hello,

There are quite a few sites showing crypto prices and related data, but I still felt it could be done better. So I worked 3 months with a friend of mine to create [CoinVision.io](https://coinvision.io/).

We tried to have a fast, mobile friendly frontpage and we think allowing you to star your favorite coins is very useful. Prices update automatically and in real-time as we pull data straight from 36+ exchanges (grows by the day). Finally we put a lot of work in the portfolio and alerting system, although it is still arguably far from perfect.

We'd love to hear some honest feedback!

DexNS contracts have successfully passed a bugbounty. Contracts are currently deployed at the following addresses:

DexNS frontend: [0x101f1920e4cD9c7e2aF056E2cB1954d0DD9647b9](http://gastracker.io/addr/0x101f1920e4cd9c7e2af056e2cb1954d0dd9647b9)

DexNS storage: [0x28fc417c046d409c14456cec0fc6f9cde46cc9f3](https://gastracker.io/addr/0x28fc417c046d409c14456cec0fc6f9cde46cc9f3)

This version is final, no more testing, debugging and re-deploying.

## The purpose of DexNS

1. DexNS serves to resolve hex addresses into human-readable names.

2. DexNS is a necessary solution of scalability of third party services that are working with tokens. Look at MyEtherWallet. They are adding each token manually. DexNS can allow automatic token support and solve this problem once and forever.

3. DexNS is designed so that it allows to register a Name instantly. This allows to integrate it with other smart-contracts, while ENS lacks this opportunity.

## Why so long? DexNS was 3 months in a state of debugging and testing.

The answer is pretty simple: I will not launch a service if I'm not sure that it is working as intended. I believe that it is better to test, debug, fix and test again within 3 months than to launch it as soon as possible and repeat the history of TheDAO, Parity multisig, or ERC20 tokens.

It is better to spend 3 months in debugging stage than to launch and let someone to lose $60,000,000.

## Will trial names be transferred to the main DexNS system?

No, trial names are not transferred to the final version of DexNS.

You can register names, apart from well-known token abbreviations, that are pre-registered to avoid phishing. Each DexNS name will cost 0.1 ETC to register to avoid name spamming.

It is also planned to support DexNS names at [Address-To-Address Message system](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Address-to-Address-messaging) to allow users to contact an owner of the address.

If you are concerned about the gas you spent to register a trial Name, feel free to write me or comment here. I'm ready to refund the gas if it's so important for you.

Prior to the hard fork, I bought 50 Ether, created a wallet and then contract with the ethereum desktop wallet and then sent the Ether to the contract. I still have the private key to the wallet address and have successfully imported it to the Emerald Wallet, but I can't figure out how to gain access to the 50 ETC I have stored in the contract. With the original desktop wallet I used whenever I would import my private key the contract address would also show up, but I can't get the Ethereum Classic Wallet to even sync. I also tried the web wallet, but every time I tried to send the ETC from the contract to an address it didn't execute and would send 0 for some reason. Honestly, i'm pretty lost so any help would be greatly appreciated. I will send some  ETC to whoever successfully helps me out!

I’ve been mining ETC for about a month and a half now and I wanted to share with you my experience with building and configuring a rig that, in my humble opinion is performing rather well. I will try to be as detailed as possible but if someone does not understand something, feel free to send me a message and I will try to help. 

This article will not be about building a huge mining farm for millions of dollars, instead it is targeted towards people that want to dip their toe in the world of mining, start small, learn the basics and then decide for themselves how much they want to dedicate to it (personally, the experience got me excited and I started dedicating more and more time to the cause).

&amp;nbsp;

**Part I - The Hardware**

When picking a hardware, the first thing to consider is your budget. In my opinion, start small, regardless of how much money you have. As with all investments, when you lack personal experience, going all in is never a good approach. Regardless of how much articles/guides you read on the Internet, until you start fiddling yourself, you will never get the maximum out of your hardware. Which brings me to another important point - identical GPUs are not as identical as you think. Even if you buy 2 cards from the same manufacturer that came out of the factory one after another, they will most likely be a little different (one will clock slightly better than the other, or spend a little more electricity, or run a little bit too hot, or too loud, things like that). 

So here is what you are going to need to get started:

&amp;nbsp;

**1. Motherboard**

There are many options on the market. One thing to consider is how many PCI-E slots does it have. I suggest going for one with 6 slots, but of course it is entirely up to you to decide on this.

The motherboard we are going to use in this guide is [Gigabyte H110-D3A Mining](https://www.amazon.com/GIGABYTE-GA-H110-D3A-LGA1151-Cryptocurrency-Motherboard/dp/B073ZMZV6K).

&amp;nbsp;

**2. CPU**

Mining is not a CPU-intensive task. A basic Intel Celeron unit will be more than sufficient. The one we will be using is [Intel Celeron G3930 (2.9Ghz), 2MB Intel Smart Cache, Socket 1151](https://www.amazon.com/Intel-BX80677G3930-Celeron-Desktop-Processors/dp/B01MYTY55V/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516101378&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Intel+Celeron+G3930)

&amp;nbsp;

**3. RAM**

Random Access Memory is relatively cheap and there is always a need for it. You wont need much of it for the mining itself as much as for running the operating system and the additional software (no one likes a laggy PC)

&amp;nbsp;

**4. SSD**

Prices for Solid State Drives have dropped significantly and considering that you won’t be storing your movie collection on the miner, one 120GB will be sufficient. Everything on the market will be a good pick right now. You might see people using USB flash drives instead of SSDs, however I am strongly against this. Not that it won’t do the job, but it just doesn’t look serious.

&amp;nbsp;

**5. GPU**

The Graphics Processing Unit or simply the video cards are the heart of your miner. Here are my thoughts on picking the right GPU:

&amp;nbsp;

-	Algorithm - if you go to [Whattomine](https://whattomine.com), you can check the hash rates of different cards for different algorithms. Pick the algorithm of the currency that you want to mine and check what is the hash rate of different cards. You are looking for the highest number, but as I will explain in a bit, it is not everything.

&amp;nbsp;

-	Power consumption - Again at Whattomine you can see the power consumption of the cards at maximum load. Keep in mind that this is a relative figure and not the final one, yours may vary with up to 20%.

&amp;nbsp;

-	Community - this is perhaps the most important thing to consider. You will be doing a lot of digging on the Internet and you want information. You want people that have “been there and done that”. 

&amp;nbsp;

-	Custom ROMs - I see a lot of videos on the Internet where people take the cards out of the box, plug them to the miner and then start hashing at max speeds. This is not true. If you spend enough time on the forums you will notice that people are reporting significantly lower out-of-the-box hash rates. You will need to apply a custom ROM to your card and then experiment with the clock speeds in order to get maximum performance out of your card. Therefore, you need to pick a card that has an abundance of custom ROMs to choose from. 

&amp;nbsp;

-	Price tag - price isn’t everything here. In order to decide how much to spend on a GPU, check the above points and compare. Open a few separate tabs in your browser, pick a few cards and compare their stats. You are looking for the best hash rate + power consumption to price ratio. (e.g. One Vega64 provides roughly 40.0Mh/s for Ethash at 230W and one RX 580 provides 30Mh/s at 135W. Vega64 costs twice as much as the RX 580 but provides only 30% more performance and uses 75% more power. Also, at that moment there is a significant lack of custom ROMs for the Vega64, although that might change in the future. Based on this, at the moment it is much better to buy two RX 580s instead of one Vega64)

&amp;nbsp;

-	GPU Memory - Always go for the 8GB versions. This will guarantee much longer lifecycle for the card as 4GB will soon not be enough to store the DAG.

&amp;nbsp;

For this guide, we will be using two [XFX RX 580 GTS 8GB Black Edition](https://www.amazon.com/XFX-Radeon-DirectX-RX-580P828D6-Express/dp/B072B6W44N/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516101691&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=xfx+rx+580+8gb). 

&amp;nbsp;

**6. GPU raisers**

Those clever little things are very useful and a necessity. It is basically an extender for your PCI-E slots so you can have freedom when it comes to connecting your cards to the motherboard. One advice, don’t save money on those. A bad riser might impact the performance of your card and you will waste a lot of time looking for the problem and at the end you will end up spending more money anyway. To save trouble, just go for the better ones, they cost about $20 a piece.

&amp;nbsp;

**7. Power Supply Unit**

The PSU is an extremely important component. GPUs are very sensitive towards voltages and if your PSU is unable to provide stability, you will have a lot of issues. Another thing is the load. The GPUs and the PSU will be under constant load 24x7 so even though components have warranty, you don’t want to have downtime every few months and wait for retailers to switch components. After all, the idea of the mining business is to run it 24x7 in the background. 

&amp;nbsp;

**8. Frame to attach all the hardware to**

I’ve seen people do crazy things with the frames. I have a friend who stuck the components to cardboards and the GPUs he attached to cloth hangers. Very nasty way to treat your components in my opinion. There is an abundance of frames on the Internet, find one that is stable and looks good and avoid wood. 

&amp;nbsp;

**9. Power button**

Often neglected, the power button is a key component. Imagine building the whole thing and you are just about to turn it on when you realize that you can’t do it. Well, you can, by using a flat screwdriver and shorting the two pins on the motherboard where you are supposed to connect the button, but do you really want to do that? So, to avoid such situations, order a power button. They are sold on e-bay and cost $2 for 10 pieces or something like that.

&amp;nbsp;

*Putting it all together*

If you have never assembled a PC before this is an excellent opportunity to learn how to do it. There are plenty of videos on YouTube that will show you how to assemble the components, but if you are worried you might brake something, ask a friend who is skilled at that kind of things to help you out. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Part II - The software**

Once you have finished assembling all the hardware, plug your miner to the power and don’t forget the network as well. Give it a quick start to test that everything is working fine. 

&amp;nbsp;

**1. The Operating System**

As with any other computer, you need an operating system in order to run your mining software. You have two options - Windows and Linux. Now, don’t get me wrong, I am a huge fan of Linux and Unix in general, however I have to say that you will cause yourself a big headache if you decide to use Linux. Drivers, tools, everything requires way more effort to make it work. Just go for the good old Windows and save yourself a lot of time, especially if computers are not your second nature. My advice is go for Windows 10. Even though a lot of people don’t like it, you are not going to be using it as your everyday computer but most drivers and software might have compatibility issues with older versions. 

&amp;nbsp;

**2. Drivers**

Always download the latest drivers from the official website of the manufacturer of your GPUs. This way you will make sure that everything is up-to-date and there is no malicious software that might end up on your miner. In this guide, I will use AMD Radeon Software Adrenalin Edition v.17.12.2

&amp;nbsp;

**3. Additional tools**

We are going to need the following additional software:

* ATIWinFlash
Used for flashing the graphics card BIOS
[Download](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/ati-atiflash/)

&amp;nbsp;

* Polaris Bios Editor
Used for modifying the BIOS of the graphic cards.
[Download](https://github.com/jaschaknack/PolarisBiosEditor)
[Official Bitcointalk thread](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1954245.0)

&amp;nbsp;

* HWiNFO64
We will run this all the time in order to check metrics, related to the GPUs, such as voltages, temperature and most importantly, memory errors
[Download](https://www.hwinfo.com/)

&amp;nbsp;

* TechPowerUp GPU-Z
We are going to need only one function from this - backing up the default BIOS of your GPU
[Download](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpuz/)

&amp;nbsp;

**4. Mining Software**

We will be using ClayMore DualMiner v.10.3
Check the official [Bitcointalk thread](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1433925.0) for the download link and other very useful information

&amp;nbsp;


**Part III - Configuration**

&amp;nbsp;

Congratulations, you now have your first mining rig, powered on and ready for action. I will assume that you have installed all the software that I have listed in the previous section and you are ready to configure. 

Few important points before you start:
* When powering off your miner, before detaching and attaching GPUs, unplug the power cable and press the power button a few times to discharge any electricity that have remained in the capacitors. This way you can make sure that there is no left-over electricity that can cause short circuits and fry your components.

&amp;nbsp;

* Install the drivers and all the software while all GPUs are plugged in. 

&amp;nbsp;

* When we start configuring, it is always better to do it one card at a time. So, power off your miner, unplug all cards except the one that you will configure first. Once you are done with it, unplug it and plug the next one. This way it will be easier to differentiate between the cards. 

&amp;nbsp;

* We will be doing customer ROM installation and overclocking which in some cases might void the warranty on your card. Modern video cards have protection, however there is still some risk involved. Do it at your own risk.

**1. Installing the Miner**

Check the above link for information how to install and configure the miner.

&amp;nbsp;

**2. Installing the custom ROM**

I am afraid that you are going to spend a lot of time searching for the right ROM for your card. There is one place on the Internet where you can find all the information - [Anorak.tech](https://anorak.tech/)

&amp;nbsp;

Here is the link for the custom ROMs that I have used on my cards:

[Download](https://anorak.tech/t/xfx-rx-580-gts-black-edition/5025)

&amp;nbsp;

Now power up GPU-Z. Search for BIOS version and click on the [arrow](https://imgur.com/cDHXyu8) on the right side. Re-name the file to default and save it on your desktop. This is the original BIOS of your video card. We are doing this in case something goes wrong when flashing the BIOS. Having the original one will help us restore the card. 

&amp;nbsp;

Extract the custom ROM that you have downloaded from Anorak. Once again, you are going to have to experiment a little bit. What works for my cards, might not work for your cards. I use the powersave version. 

&amp;nbsp;

We are going to do a little check now. Open two instances of Polaris BIOS editor. In one instance, open the original ROM that we just saved. In the other instance, open the new ROM that you are going to apply. Now look at the [ROM section](https://imgur.com/mdc22mg). Compare the values. You need to make sure that they are identical. GPU manufacturers tend to apply small differences between the same type of cards. Sometimes they run out of memory chips and they order new ones from the supplier, however the supplier does not have the old ones, but have new ones. They might be identical, but the custom ROM won’t recognize them and your card will crash. So, to be consistent, check whether those values are identical. If they are, proceed to the next step - applying the custom ROM.

&amp;nbsp;

Fire up AtiWinFlash. Make sure you run it as administrator (right click -&gt; run as administrator). You should see a screen like [this one](https://imgur.com/WooWghl). Now click on “Load Image”. Select the new custom ROM and then hit “Program”. Don’t worry if your computer freezes for a moment, it is normal. You should be presented with a screen, confirming the successful installation of the new ROM. Now reboot your miner.

&amp;nbsp;

If everything went well, your Windows should start normally.

&amp;nbsp;

Next step is to open HWiNFO64. Scroll down until you reach the section for your GPU. It should look like [this picture](https://imgur.com/oLabQ2w). What we will focus right now is the last line - GPU Memory Errors. Drag the window to the side where you can observe it all the time and open AMD Radeon Settings. You are going to need the Wattman utility. This is where the overlocking will happen. 

&amp;nbsp;

When it comes to overclocking, it is all about experimenting. Also, notice that we are going to be both overclocking and undervolting. I won’t go into details because this guide is long enough already, instead I have attached the photos that show my values. Use this as a reference. As I said, cards are different, those numbers work for me but they might not work for you. Change the values in small steps. Try to push the limits of your card - smaller voltage, bigger memory clock. When applying new settings, always start your miner and check the GPU Memory Errors. They should always be at 0. If you experience memory errors, your mining will not be efficient. 

&amp;nbsp;

So here are my results:

* [HWiNFO64](https://imgur.com/m8DgovW)

&amp;nbsp;

This is from me guys. I hope that you will find this guide useful and will help you on your way to becoming a miner.

[Ethereum Commonwealth](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth) announces the launch of a new blockchain called Callisto Network (CLO). The source code of the Callisto client can be found [here](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/go-callisto). At the time of Callisto's launch, all accounts that had ETC on their balance at the time of block 5500000 will receive an equivalent amount of CLO in the ratio of 1:1. We will make a snapshot of ETC blockchain at 5500000 block and input all the account balances to the Callisto genesis block. It is possible to use the same addresses and accounts on ETC and CLO networks. 

# Callisto whitepaper and technical details

[Callisto whitepaper revision 0.9](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16sW_0YajCedBdLvr9jmgJqE9L-SzuYKq/view) can be found here. 

# User education and frequently asked questions

## How do I receive my CLO if I own ETC?

As it was said earlier you can use your ETC account on CLO network. Every ETC account address that has ETC on balance will receive the equivalent amount of CLO automatically at the moment of Callisto launch. You will just unlock your wallet and see your CLO are already here.

This is only related to wallets that allow you to control a private key of your ETC accout address.

This wallets will guaranteed work: 

- [ClassicEtherWallet](https://ethereumproject.github.io/etherwallet/)
- [ClassicMask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/classicmask/eenghieamipnambbokkpbbdoamilcbao)
- [MyEtherWallet](https://myetherwallet.com/) can support Callisto as well but it depends on MEW developers. If they will not add Callisto support then you can just use MyEtherWallet accounts on ClassicEtherWallet - they are compatible.

Read this for better understanding of Ethereum Classic accounts: [user education article](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ctsl6/some_user_education_about_ethereum_addresses/).

## What if I store my ETC on MyEtherWallet/ClassicEtherWallet/JAXX/Mist/Emerald Wallet?

**You do not store your ETC in a wallet.** None of the wallets can store ETC because ETCs are stored in Ethereum Classic blockchain. Each wallet is just an interface that allows you to interact with Ethereum Classic blockchain to execute your operations. Wallet is just a beautiful picture. 

Everything that happens under the hood is exactly the same as if you execute your operations from ETC command line client because everything that is going on with ETC accounts is only related to ETC blockhcain. If you have an account at one of the wallets then you can export your account and use it with any of the another wallets. They must be compatible, because they do exactly the same things: they interact with the ETC blockchain, and there is no way to do this differently because the ETC blockchain is the same for everyone.

## What if I have my ETC on exchange balance?

Each exchange has an account (or multiple accounts) where it stores its ETC. Technically this account will receive CLO at the time of airdrop in the same way as any other account. It depends on the exchange, whether it decides to give you CLO or dispose of them in a different way.
We will contact the exchanges and publish a list of exchanges that will decide to distribute the CLO to their users here: https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Roadmap/issues/42

I can recommend asking the technical support of the exchange about the support of Callisto airdrop, if the exchanger on which you store the ETC does not appear on the list, which I will publish as soon as I receive replies from the main exchanges.",NA,"7qs9ui",NA,0,NA,"false",1518543793,"false","self","t5_3fgtx","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/EthereumClassic/comments/7qs9ui/callisto_network_announcement/",NA,"",NA,"Announcement","",0,1

Subject: Does anyone know what Coinbase did with ETC sent to them accidentally back in 2016?

The Hard Fork creating ETC happened back on block 1920000 on Jul-20-2016 01:20:40 PM +UTC.

https://www.coinbase.com/etc-withdraw was made available for a couple of months at Coinbase which as I understand, temporarily allowed ETC withdrawals.

It was made available on Oct 20. 2016 according to the Coinbase Twitter feed at https://twitter.com/GDAX/status/789197569821773824 but was removed effective Dec 30, 3016 according to the Coinbase support article at https://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2524725-ethereum-classic-faq

Supposedly, according to https://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2524725-ethereum-classic-faq the balances available were based on both the hard fork balance of any ETH stored in coinbase plus any additional ETC that was sent directly to a coinbase or GDAX account.

That support document says:

	How was my ETC credit calculated?

	ETC balances contained the amount of ETC associated with your GDAX balance immediately prior to the hard fork plus any additional ETC that was sent directly to your Coinbase or GDAX account after the hard fork. It did not include any ETC that was withdrawn as part of transactions since the hard fork, nor any ETC which was sent to Coinbase via a split contract.

I recently discovered that back on October 16, 2016, I sent unsplit ETH/ETC directly from the then current version of the standard Ethereum Wallet to my coinbase account. Both the ETH and the ETC appear on the respective blockchains of both currencies. I see on the blockchain the Coinbase immediately split out the ETC from the ETH, but they nevery notified me of this ETC, and the previously available withdrawal tool is of course no longer available.

Does anyone know what Coinbase did with ETC accidentally sent to them after the hard fork but prior to their release of their ETC withdrawal tool? What did they do with all the unclaimed ETC?

I owned a lot of ethereum which I bought because I thought Bitcoin was too expensive. Luckily, I had a 2 digit Bitcoin bag.

At the time of the hardfork people Said the dao hack will erase ethereum and the hardfork coin will take over. Well it didnt.

Since day 1, I have bought worth hundred of thousands or dollars, made great profit, increased my btc. But Sometimes I dont sell on the top. I just ride the wave as a long term investor. Because of this, I missed other pumps but I dont care. Because all exchanges have problem when you withdraw money so the cryptonetwork is not so mature yet. More room for bigger and better exchanges ans regulatorns. So I dont worry that I didnt make another $600k proft for example, because you cant cash out even $10k worth from coinbase, bitstamp, kraken, polo, etc etc. To those who say hodl.. what should I hodl? For every 1 dollar I spent I made 50 dollar in profit lol. Just do the math with my numbers. 

However, if you buy etc today thinking it will do a 1:1 with ethereum or whatever, stay away. Buy another lowcap coin with more room to grow. Its easier to go from 20 cents to 1 dollar than from 30 dollar to 150. If you would want a 5x.

Personally I like and hate etc. It made me money but I think it was more patience and luck than anything else. I remember selling 6000 eth when the dao hack happened... luckily I still have a few thousands eth left because I bought them January 2016. Anyway. Good luck. Until we dont have good exchanges, regulations, being able to withdraw huge amount $100k+ in a day worth of crypto, then it doesnt matter if etc is at 30 or 300 or btc at 11 000 or 30 000.

As Mantis client is evolving and turning into an important part of ETC ecosystem it was decided to launch a public Mantis node. 

There are not so many public RPC nodes in the ETC network at the moment. From our point of view, this is a problem and we should add more variety of public nodes. As the result, it was decided to launch two more public RPC nodes on Ethereum Commonwealth servers and integrate them into ClassicEtherWallet with the next release: https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/etherwallet/pull/20

We have launched one Geth node and one Mantis node. Currently, the nodes are syncing. The Mantis node was recently developed and put into operation, so we do not use it by default but allow experienced users to choose and use it, thus we can help the adoption of a new client and collecting feedbacks.

The source code of Mantis client could be found here: https://github.com/input-output-hk/mantis

Following the current price surge of ETC and the upcoming [Callisto](https://cryptovest.com/news/etc-callisto-airdrop-announcement-leads-to-price-surge-and-stability/) airdrop, I decided to share a mining rig that I have built two months ago. 

**HARDWARE**

* Motherboard - GIGABYTE H110-D3A MINING EDITION 6XPCIE
I decided to go for this one because it is LGA1151 and DDR4 memory and it is at a very good price (about $90). Downside is it has only 2 memory slots but considering that I don't see a scenario where you will need more than 8GB RAM, it is really not a big deal.


* CPU - Intel Celeron G3930 (2.9GHz), 2.90 GHz, 2MB Intel Smart Cache, Socket 1151
It is more than sufficient for mining needs and it's only $45 which is a huge bargain in my opinion


* Memory - Pretty much any DDR4 memory would work. I am using a single 4GB stick at 2133MHz, cost me $20 and so far it is enough

* SSD - With the current price tag of SSDs, any 120GB would do the job

* GPU **[the heart of your miner]** - XFX RX 580 GTS 8GB Black edition
I bought those two cards at an auction for $350 a piece and 3-year full warranty. The best thing about these cards, in my opinion is that they have two separate BIOS's. One for gaming, one for mining. And even though the ""mining"" one gave extremely low hash rates by default, you can experiment with different mods and feel calm because even if you mess up the BIOS, you can switch to the other one and restore it. 

*If you are interested, I will write a full guide on how I configured the cards in a separate post. Let me know in the comments*

My current hash rate with this configuration is 29.5Mh/s per card for a total of 59MH/s for ETC and 650MH/s per card for a total of 1,300MH/s for SiaCoin. This is about 8 ETC/month and about 800Sc/month, although those numbers will change for the better in the upcoming months, considering all the plans that have been revealed for both currencies. 

*PSU - A 750W PSU would be sufficient to power 4 of those cards, and if you go for a six-card rig, you will need another 500W PSU to power-on the remaining two cards.

[Callisto network](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/go-callisto) project.

#### *Rationale:*

- The main goal of Callisto network is to research and provide a reference implementation of an experimental protocol changes that aim to establish a smart-contract based on-chain governance system, completely financially transparent built-in development funding mechanism and balance the interest in the network between the miners and coin holders (ordinary network users).

- It is possible to improve the scalability of both ETC and Callisto networks by using one as a sidechain.

- Create a field for crosschain services improvements. It is also possible to establish a core of any crosschain service at the Callisto network and use Callisto smart-contracts state on ETC chain and visa versa which allows to facilitate the bandwidth of ETC chain. (Currently, DexNS, Address-To-Address message system, Token swap channels and ECNS are crosschain services that are deployed on ETC chain simultaneously)

#### *Here you can track the progress:*

- [GO implementation of Callisto](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/go-callisto)

- [Blockchain explorer](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Galileo/projects/1) development

- [Cold staking protocol](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Cold-staking)

#### **Summary:**

Callisto is a separate blockchain that is based on Ethereum protocol with its own cryptocurrency (CLO). Callisto has a fixed cap monetary policy similar to ETC. Unlike ETH, ETC is posing itself as a value storage. It should be noted that the ETC does not have any incentives for coin holders. The whole emission is completely controlled by miners and their influence grows with the growth of the network. Callisto introduces a `Cold staking` protocol that rewards coin holders for being a network participants. 

Cold staking is a smart-contract based process that allows CLO holders to earn interest in a total CLO emission when they hold CLO coins at their balances for long enough preiod of staking time (1 month by default). 

Cold stakers are not required to run a node to participate in cold staking process. Cold stakers are not validating transactions and the whole system can remain fully POW which is important since ETC adheres to POW consensys. It is only necessary to call the ""Staking contract"" to become a cold staker. 

Cold staking is a step towards the goal of turning the desired cryptocurrency into a value storage currency because this significantly increases a total demand to hold for stake holders. Further protocol improvements would be described at [this open document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LpRHzW7gGV1JfiXUQOmW-UEVF9TCNNWrYiItDuLgiGA/edit). It may take years to propose any changes to ETC protocol and achieve a consensys on whether we need to implement it or not. As the result it was decided to launch a separate network to implement the protocol. If the reference implementation will succeed then we can implement the protocol changes on ETC as well.

Cold staking protocol could be an intermediate step of automated on-chain governance system implementation.

Callisto whitepaper will be released soon.

#### **Callisto initial distribution**

It was decided to distribute the initial stake of CLO between current ETC holders. We will make a snapshot of ETC blockchain at block 5500000 (approximately 5 March, 2018. This depends on ETC block time and ETC hashrate changes).  Then we implement the initial balance of each ETC holder in the Callisto network genesis block, so each ETC owner will receive CLO coins automatically in a 1:1 ratio to the amount of ETC that he had at block 5500000.

# 2. [Cold staking protocol](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Cold-staking).

#### *Problem that is solved by this project:*

- There is no incentive for coin holders to continue to own coins which is important for ""store of value"" currencies. 

- Interest and influence in the network are not balanced. The balance is strongly biased towards the miners.

- Lack of governance system. Cold staking protocol could serve as an intermediate step for governance system implementation.

- [Calculations table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f9qu_nHyijcTFoHAsibq5cJK2QGxLqnkTqliUycBHds/edit#gid=171527090)

#### **Update summary:**

Reference implementation of the cold staking protocol is developed and tested. The 1.0 version of the protocol has some issues that can hurt the network bandwidth in some circumstances. The 2.0 version of the protocol is intended to resolve bandwidth issues but it is still in development.

# 3. [Callisto testnet](https://ethereumproject.github.io/etherwallet/).

#### *Problem that is solved by this project:*

- Lack of a specialized testnet for Callisto and ETC chains. If Ethereum will introduce any breaking changes then there will be no viable testnet for ETC chain. Morden testnet is very old and require syncing and mining a test block to start testing contracts on it which is not suitable in most cases.

#### *Here you can track the progress:*

- [Callisto-TEST implementation on ClassicEtherWallet](https://ethereumproject.github.io/etherwallet/)

- Callisto-TEST authorized node with open RPC: https://testnet.callisto.network

- [Callisto-TEST block explorer development](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Galileo)

- [Callisto-TEST faucet](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Callisto-Faucet)

#### **Update summary:**

Callisto-TEST is ETC-compatible implementation of Callisto protocol that allows to run smart-contracts with the same version of EVM that ETC is currently relying on. Unfortunately, there is no blockchain explorers that support Callisto-TEST now. We are working on our own blockchain explorer that will support multiple networks but it is still in development.

Callisto-TEST is now supported at ClassicEtherWallet.This means that any developer can successfully deploy, run, test and debug contracts on Callisto-TEST network.

We have a manual faucet for Callisto at the moment. You should join the ETC discord and type your address at the special #callisto-faucet channel in `tech` topic. We will distribute test-CLO manually (analogue to how Ropsten testnet works).

Advantages of Callisto-TEST network:

- Proof of Authority consensys. High DDOS resistance.

- Zero install requirements to test your contracts at this testnet.

- No need to sync your node to test contracts at this testnet.

- Reduced block time for testing reasons which allows to execute contract calls and normal transactions faster.

# 4. DexNS revenue.

#### *Here you can track the progress:*

- DexNS revenue address: [0x45b56ebb21737b2a557c07a20fb6ecb8006bae32](http://gastracker.io/addr/0x45b56ebb21737b2a557c07a20fb6ecb8006bae32)

#### **Update summary:**

A final version of DexNS is launched. 56 names are currently registered at DexNS which brings 5,6 ETC to the revenue distribution address. The amount is too small to launch a distribution between DEX token holders now. 

The amount of revenue that is generated by DexNS will be distributed between DEX token holders according to [announcement#24: revenue distribution process of Ethereum Commonwealth](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Roadmap/issues/24) as soon as the amount of revenue will be sufficient to cover gas fees for transfers to the smallest DEX holders.

# 5. Address to Address message system.

#### *Problem that is solved by this project:*

- This contract solves the problem of impossibility to contact the address owner without knowing anything other than his address.

- Ethereum lacks a central messaging system that will allow to contact an address owner directly. As the result there is no viable way to deliver a message to address owner without knowing his real identity.

#### *Here you can track the progress:*

- [Source code](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Address-to-Address-messaging).

- [Milestone#38: Address-To-Address message system discussion](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Roadmap/issues/36)

- [EIP #802](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/802)

#### **Update summary:**

A2A Message smart-contract is successfully deployed. The next step is UI implementation and integration with ClassicEtherWallet.

# 6. [ClassicEtherWallet](https://ethereumproject.github.io/etherwallet/) maintenance.

#### *Rationale:*

- Maintain and improve the efficiency of the main web-wallet of Ethereum CLassic.

#### *Here you can track the progress:*

- [ClassicEtherWallet](https://ethereumproject.github.io/etherwallet/).

- [Commit history](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/etherwallet)

#### **Update summary:**

recently, i've been reading a lot about ETH vs ETC. so i know it's a very controversial topic that could possibly get people angry. i am not a troll, or looking to start some kind of flame war... just experiencing some cognitive dissonance that i need help with

i've been mining ETH for a while just for the learning experience and maybe to make a few bucks along the way. but  i've started going beyond just the technical aspects of mining, and i'm really starting to see the value of the platform behind the tokens.

which leads me to the fork in the road between ETC and ETH. i understand, and agree that the code is law and that the blockchain should not be subject to changes based on human whims. however, for me, this still does not address the issue of ethics. if code is law, then the DAO hack did not break laws. but it was unethical. how does ETC have a sense of ethics and how can the community have a sense of justice if theft is allowed to stand? these are the two things i cannot reconcile in my mind. 

if a thief steals money from my credit card, the credit card company will reverse the charges. that's the ethical thing to do... why is ""reversing the charges"" on the DAO hack the wrong thing to do in this case? that's the best real world analogy my mind can think of. i'm sure i am missing something though. 

please help me understand the ETC point of view. 

thanks

At the time I didn't really understand what the hardfork meant. I just went with the flow and updated the software and I didn't realize I also received coins on the Ethereum Classic network. Now that I do, I would like to access them. But I don't know where to start.

While mining, the ETC was sent to a contract, not an account. And in my ETH wallet, I can't see the contract. I remember deleting or cancelling the contract after I transferred all the received mined coins. But this was on the ETH network, not the ETC network. I looked up the ETC contract address on gastracker.io and it still has the ETC balance I expected. The contract belongs to the wallet I still have the keystore file for. I just don't know how to access this contract to transfer the coins on the ETC network.

I would really appreciate it if somebody could point me in the right direction. Thank you very much for your time.

Been investing since day 1","Lets start out by wishing you all Happy new Year. Think positive. Do good stuff. Stay healthy. Help out your family.

In this post, I will talk about Ethereum Classic and my journey and what I have been doing for past 1 and half year.

So I bought ETH in the spring 2016, and holded for a few months. I then sold all My eth at the forktime because of etc. Everyone said that the eth will die out and not survive. Btw I was new to crypto in general back then. Then I bought etc the first day it hit poloniex, and I bought a ton. I have holded until now. So what have I done in the meantime?

I have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars by not selling on the top and buying the dip.

I have missed out other pumps because I am all in etc.

All in all, I have lost maybe millions in potential profit but I dont want to repeat my selling misstake. Thats why I dont daytrade.

I have a twitter account and have been supporting etc there and spreading nice words about it and also on telegram and other platforms. I did that for free. So much stress, anxiesty and work for nothing. 

Would I do it again? Probably. I am just dissapointed about etc not hitting 0.01 in etc/btc pair despite all the good news. Etc seem to be stuck and everytime it pumps some butthurt idiots will come and spread fud and say by on the dip etc, its gonna go down.

I just hold and hope for the best. It should atleast be 1:2 to ethereum. I would be happy with even 1:5. But the reality is, etc wont overtake eth. I hope I am wrong.

Me and the few I know in the etc world, holds a very large amount of etc. They sometimes call us whales etc, even tho I dont daytrade. I just watch chart every 15 minute and check twitter etc. All that for nothing. 

I have waited for a large pump. I have made lots of profits if I sell my coins now. But I am a bit greedy. I want and need more. I am all in etc. Either etc is putting me in my dream house or I dont know. I basically invested everything in it and I dont regret it. I am up over 20x till now. But I want more.

But I am not so optimistc about the pumps etc because all these events and nothing happened. Even eth and ltc pumped during the last Bitcoin bullrun. What the hell, even most shit coins pumped. And even if it pumped hard, like very very hard, I would have lots of btc. The problem would be to cash it out. Even if you are legit and have all the documents, some exchanges will screw you over. This makes me think, we are still in an early stage. Since there is really no good exchanges who actually send peoples btc ans withdrawls etc, I can just try to cash out bit by bit by the time I would sell my coins. Even this is a problem. I dont trust the ”regulated” exchanges because even if they are regulated but they dont send our withdrawls to us, we are as good as screwd and would only wait and hope for the best.",NA,"7ncqit",NA,0,NA,"false",1518480570,"false","self","t5_3fgtx","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/EthereumClassic/comments/7ncqit/where_will_etc_ethereum_classic_go_been_investing/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

Could this latest pump cause it to go to new ATH? i noticed the volume like quadrupled on bittrex since yesterday, which is a good sign.

No doubt others will comment below as to their preferred exchanges and transfer methods (especially so as to minimise fees - I have always been pretty laid back in this regard and can't honestly say I shop around as much as I might do).

**Step 1 - do your research**

This is a 'preliminary step' in reality, but this doesn't mean it's not important. Read up (Google, this sub, and various YouTube videos provide excellent information in respect of cryptocurrency, blockchain and the various coins available), be a critical reader (every author has his or her bias and many have an agenda to pusher) and form your own opinion as to the state of the market.

**Step 2 - purchase cryptocurrency with fiat (government-backed currency such as USD, EUR or GBP)**

There are various methods of purchasing cryptocurrency with fiat but unfortunately, in the majority of cases, these are limited to the most popular coins - think BTC, ETH and LTC.

Personally, I use CoinBase (available as an app or in your browser) - https://www.coinbase.com.

From Coinbase, purchase a cryptocurrency which can be exchanged for ETC. You can check whether an ETC pairing is available on your exchange (more on those later) but, generally speaking, this will be BTC or ETH.

**Step 3 - register on an exchange**

In reality, I would suggest registering for *multiple* exchanges, so as to be able to take advantage of varying exchange rates. No doubt others have their views on their preferred exchange and they will share those below. For me however, I have enjoyed using the following:

**Binance**: this is a large, established and well-known exchange. BTC and ETH pairings are available for ETC. Reasonable fees, limited outages and high-volume. All of the established coins are available here. 

https://www.binance.com

**KuCoin**: this is a rapidly growing exchange, with a very user friendly interface and, by cryptocurrency exchange standards, a responsive customer service. A number of little-known alt coins are available and it can be an excellent place to pick up smaller coins pre-surge. The fees are very low and they have a generous referral program which I can personally vouch for! BTC, ETH and KCS pairs are available for ETC.

https://www.kucoin.com/#/?r=7KQvKN or https://www.kucoin.com and use my code - 7KQvKN (full disclosure - I get a referral bonus if you sign up and use this exchange. If you sign-up, invite your friends for bonus of your own!)

**Poloniex**: a medium-sized exchange, with a nice UI and reasonably low fees. All major coins and some interesting prospects are available here. BTC, ETH and USDT pairs are available for ETC.

https://poloniex.com

**Step 4: transfer your cryptocurrency from Coinbase**

Use the deposit feature on your exchange and the send feature on Coinbase. Be sure to type the deposit address correctly (or use a QR code if transferring from your mobile).

**Step 5: Exchange from your entry currency to ETC**

As per your chosen exchange's instructions. See Step 1 - do your research and see which exchange offers the best exchange rates.

**Step 6: transfer your ETC to a wallet (*optional*)**

I have marked this 'optional' but I would strongly recommend you transfer your new ETC off the exchange and into a wallet. This is more secure (in the event of an issue with your exchange) and also prevents you from making rash sell decisions (see Step 7). I personally use a Ledger Nano S, but other options are available, along with a number of free, software ledgers.

**Step 7: HOLD**

Try not to obsess over minute graphs, believe in the coin you have invested in and come back every few days to stay abreast of developments in the crypto space. 

**Disclosure - I hold a modest amount of ETH, ETC, BurstCoin, KinCoin and XLM. I will probably post similar posts in those coin's subs.**

### Project

A Official Ethereum Classi Tip Bot for Telegram groups 


---

### Why a Tipbot

|Pros|Cons
|:-:|:-:
|Brings the community together|A lot of messages of the bot is used often
|Rewards for good/helpful posts

---

### Progress

- 9.Dezember 2017 
I fist texted a developer from the reddcoin network who developed the [Redcoin Tip Bot](https://github.com/samgos/reddbot-telegram) for the official telegram group.

- 2.Januar 2018
I asked the bot developer how easy it would be to convert this bot in to a ETC tip bot. He said ""Easy!"" (I am not a python guy so I don't know how easy it is)

---

### My thoughts

I love ETC and I wanted for a long time that kind of bot that has only to do with Ethereum Classic. So I searched everywhere for a **bot** + **the code** + **the developer**. Now I found one and I am willing to pay(**I will add 0,5 ETC to all other donations**) to any one who will get the code for the Ethereum Classic bot running that we (the community) can use this bot in Telegram groups.

---

### What we need

1. We need some skilled guys to convert code that it will work with the ETC Network. 
2. We need a Server to run a node + python telegram command scrypt. **(We definitely need Donations for that)**
3. The official [ETC group](https://t.me/ethclassic) to add the bot.

---

### Donations
To help that the bot will come true every one who also like the idea can tip the developers who helped to make the ETC tip bot. I will collect the ETC in a Wallet and then spread it all over the devs. As I said it allready in ""My thoughts"" I will add up **0,5 ETC to all other donations**.

**If you want to help the communtity send any amount**

Remember to raise your stop losses as the value rises so you don’t get caught with your pants down. I set around 30% below the current channel / support level. 
I’d like to start doing this every couple of weeks for the community but it takes a lot of time and effort to track charts, events, analyze volume trends etc. If I can start getting some support I will try and make it happen.

ETC Analysis

Just a heads up Ethereum Classic is going to be an on and off ramp for fiat in Japan’s newest and largest exchange in just a few days (DMM).  DMM.com is a major player in Japan with more than 4 Billion in annual revenue so their exchange launching in a few days is going to make a splash. I've been adding to my ETC position over the last week or so I expect it to pop. ETC is also is loosely connected to ETH and has been lagging quite a bit while ETH is on fire.  ETC will be the cheapest of a total of 7 coins on DMM launching in 5 days and we all know how plebs love to own whole coins…Check out the huge increase in volume on this one…good sign.
Alan masters is calling a 4x for it over several weeks.  I’m a little less optimistic but I see it as a very easy 2x-3x with low downside risk.

QASH Analysis 

QASH chart looks like awareness is growing. That's one I meant to get into earlier and slept on.  imo it's worth investigating I plan to hodl it as i believe it will be a cash cow once fully operational.  QASH creates liquidity between exchanges and if I had to guess probably will actively arbitrage.  Any exchange that can fluidly connect to ALL other exchanges will quickly become #1. How many times have you wished you could get coins at the best price or wanted to sell at the higher price? This company could do a billion a day in revenue imo in arbitrage and fees alone. I expect a 4x from this over the next couple months but long term easy 30x or more. 
Q1 2018 - LAUNCH QUOINE LIQUID WORLD BOOK (QUOINE is launching a single globally-sourced trading platform (World Book) with an associated suite of services (Prime Brokerage) that brings together the entire global network of cryptocurrency exchanges to enable the highest level of liquidity to all markets.) 
Q1 2019 - Asset management &amp; investment banking 
Q3 2019 - Full crypto banking license 
https://www.tradingview.com/chart/QSHBTC/EiS6qA7u-QASH-QSHBTC-Liquidity-for-Wall-Street/ 
Campus Coin
Campus Coin (probably a shit coin) has a tiny 3M market cap. I’m taking a gamble here but they’re completely under the radar and I have some friends loosely connected to them so I know it’s not a scam. They just signed a deal that will get them exposure at all the upcoming NCAA college events including national championships.  In this market even a tiny TINY amount of public awareness could send a 3M market cap flying up to 30M or even 100M (33x).  
https://medium.com/@campuscoin/campuscoin-project-progress-report-9-7f636da6a4ce 
Campus Coin is also just starting an awareness campaign running a video contest!  
Zencash Analysis
Zencash is one more sleeper. Jan 24th they have a white paper update. Jan 31st they have a website update AND ledger integration. IMO Those catalysts alone will catapult this guy. Again small cap 150M fork from Zcash usually trades up with Zcash but has been mostly ignored by the market. I expect a short term 4x from this and longer term 10x. 
https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ZENBTC/wkynjYjr-ZEN-Buy-Opportunity/  
Zen will follow Zcash and ZCL so don’t sleep on it ��

I generated a signed transaction on an offline device and have previously used the ""Send / Publish Transaction"" section on https://www.myetherwallet.com/#offline-transaction but it doesn't seem to be working today. It claims the transaction was published but it doesn't show up on gastracker.io or etherhub.io so I am suspecting that there is a problem with the epool node they are connected to.

You can now interact with the time locked contracts from sainthodl.com using Myetherwallet. 


How to use:

## To Store

Send etc coins to any of the addresses on sainthodl.com to lock them for n-blocks

## To Check

Copy and paste the address form the site to MEW and check your balance and release time

## Withdraw
Send withdraw() when the time is up and your coins come back.

The only cost is the tx cost. 

DO NOT SEND DIRECTLY FROM AN EXCHANGE TO A HODL CONTRACT! 

If you've never interacted with a contract before, this could be a good one to play with. Send to the 5 block contract (~70 seconds) and practice withdrawing. ETC chain will still work if you set gas to the lowest on MEW

I just realised it has half my ETC.  I sent ETH to an exchange ages ago and I guess my ETC got replay attacked, but then that ETC was sent to this address, along with ~100,000 others.

Is this an exchange address that I could potentially ask them for it to be credited to my account?

I write on behalf of [ChainThis](https://chainthis.com) project. Our team is developing a service that allows to create Blockchain Oracles within Ethereum or Ethereum Classic network. We establish a connection between the on-chain and off-chain worlds.

What does it mean?
Now you can use smart contracts functionality not only for resolving internal issues in the network, you can operate the data from the real world.
For example, now you can write a smart contract for betting that allows you to encapsulate the entire process within a decentralized network.

We are creating a powerful tool and want to hear your opinion. Which direction in development do you deem the most important? What is missing right now? What kind of projects requires our functionality at the moment?

Among our short-term plans is to launch a coding contest based on our API.

Been trying to wrap my head around PoW vs PoS and I just can’t sum up the end game for PoS. I have many questions but I’ll start with a basic one. 

Maybe someone can explain it to me. 

If we assume that a coin will be around for a long time, all roads seem to lead to centralization. 

Eventually the people with the most coins will have even more coins and so be in charge. 

All a bank has to do to gain control is buy 51% of a currency and that’s about it. There is now way to regain control short of making new coins or doing hard fork I suppose.

I have been researching this for the past few weeks but seriously, I cant find anything valuable. Most people say stay out of exchange hold your coins on a wallet. Smh. Like I didnt know that? Fucking retarded people who just jumped on the crypto train with their shitty investments.

One method is multi-algo hashing.I propose a new method of scaling difficulty to mining rewards.

Right now, as more miners join, the difficulty rate goes up. What if instead of an increase in difficulty, a decrease in payout occurs? For example, if the last block was generated 10 minutes ago, the payout is 50 coins. If it was generated 5 minutes ago, the payout is 25 coins. Now, this last block measurement can be extended back through time along the blockchain. So lets say the last block-5 was deployed 50 minutes ago. That is an average of 10 minutes. So far so good. But what if the last block -5 was deployed 30 minutes ago? That means the average time was 6 minutes. 

By doing this, we can calculate a payout that optimizes the network payout rate for calculating a block. This would dynamically price the rate that hashes are worth. 

The only big downside from what I see is lots of orphan blocks. What are your thoughts?",NA,"7rjvej",NA,0,NA,"false",1518557946,"false","self","t5_3fgtx","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/EthereumClassic/comments/7rjvej/pow_scaling/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

No idea I could mess this up, but I copied an ETC address incorrectly (didnt include the last 2 digits of the address) and sent over 100 ETC to it.

It was an ETC address and not an ETH address, but now it shows over 30 confirmations already. Thought the network would reject it or something? This is not a valid address, at least not likely to be one. Again the correct address was 2 digits longer, but I copied it incorrectly.

Any way to get my funds back? I don't control the address which I sent to, since it's not a real address, right? How can it be a real address when it's just a part of a real address (a real address minus the last 2 digits)

By the way, I can definitely offer a reward if anyone can help me do this! 

Thanks in advance! Again no idea this would happen. Feel like a total noob again...

PS if it's necessary I can post the txid and addresses.

EDIT: TXID

supposed to be:

0xe07b51764de835492fcf1d15879c57dddf6f4971

but instead was:

0x00E07B51764De835492fcf1D15879c57DDDf6F49 without the 71


here is the transaction:

Note that I sent to the correct address also, obviously with another txid. What's up with this protocol? How can this be allowed to happen. That goes for sister coin ETH as well... as I said even grampa BTC wont allow transactions to go through unless it fits the correct format.

I have a question and i want to discuss a little bit on it. The question is connected with trading and fixing of profit.
So, the question. Guys, what do you think about the best moment to sell some ETC bags and to fix profit in BTC? Will be it before the blockchain snapshot, at the moment of snapshot or even after it? What are your predictions? What are your targets? 0.06 BTC? 0.08? 0.1? When will we see the BTC peak of ETC in near future? Thank you for your answers!

I'm a new miner, mining ETH for less than a month. As a newbie, I followed the main crowd and started mining ETH, but I'm thinking ETC will reward us better, so today I moved from ETH to ETC.

As the algorithm is the same, all I should do is move from pool, right (using nanopool)? The thing is... My hashing is very unstable, varying from a stable 340mh/s on ETH to something between 300/400mh/s on ETC. This has only been observed for 10 hours, since the switch.

Is that normal? Am I missing anything?

Is there a possibility that CLOs sidechain can be used by ETC as a way to secure it's chain from a 51% attack ? The network is not big enough yet to eliminate that possibility and we never know if a future technology will be able to produce massively more hash power and make this kind of attacks cheaper and easier to commit so is ETC making CLO as an attempt to prevent that or is there something I'm not seeing because of my ignorance ?

Last month I moved about $1500 worth of ETC to a MEW address using a Trezor cold storage device.
I later on ended up returning the Trezor and getting a Nano S instead. Before I returned the Trezor I went through each of the wallets and checked the balance was zero. I swear my ETC wallet showed zero however, I do not remember syncing to MEW at the time... which turned out to be a mistake. 
Checking the Bittrex send-to address I can see my coins are still at the address, however, I do not have the Trezor anymore to retrieve them. On top of that, after sending it back I shredded the Seed/ Phrase card. Before I go through a pile of shredded paper to possibly try and piece it together I wanted to ask if it would be even possible to recover the coins if I have the phrase recovered? 

Am I missing something?  
Please advise. Thank you.    

UPDATE: Unfortunately, my 12-blade crosscut shredder pulverized parts of the card the phrase was on. After spending most of the day and actually getting pretty close I had to give up. I will frame it to remind me of my stupidity. Never again.

Dear Community,

We would like now to give you some feedback regarding Round 1 of our beta test.

First off, we would like to thank everyone who participated in Round 1. Your input has been truly valuable!

The test started on time and lasted for 6 hours. During this time we have collected massive feedback as well as bug reports.

From this perspective Round 1 has been very effective and has fully reached its goal.

We have analyzed and processed all responses and our dev team working on improvements. It will most likely take some time, so we will send notifications when we are ready to move on.

All Round 1 participants will be invited to take part in subsequent rounds.

Please stay tuned to updates!

Sincerely, UPcoin Team

Dear friends,
I would like to point out the shameful attitude of the ""CowOperate"" administrator on the telegram chat of the official ETC channel.
I was an ETC telegram user until a few hours ago when a ""CowOperate"" administrator decided to bribe me and I'll explain why.

I was in the chat for a few months and I followed this coin with passion, when a few minutes ago the administrator ""CowOperate"" repeatedly publishes an announcement:
""send me 100 ETC me and I sent 1000 ETC you"" in public, asking to be contacted in private.
Justifies the operation by stating that there is a user who wants to sell 1000 ETCs in exchange for 10 BCH.

Contact ""CowOperate"" privately by saying textual words ""I have only 5 ETC my friend"", and from that moment I am inexplicably banned.

If this is an administrator of an official chat I ask:
we do not have any better to represent ETC on telegram?
Would not it be appropriate for an administrator to behave correctly without banning users for non-existent reasons?

I ask some other admin to riaccettarmi in chat, reread everything and understand that I have no reason to be out of chat.

Since that time we've had to do a lot of work reviewing and auditing various multisig contracts (big thanks /u/Dexaran) to ensure that the funds would be safe and accessible.

We're in the final stages so just wanted to bring everyone up to speed. I'll have more details in the coming days.

In my mind, unless you can spend thousands of dollars on a countdown clock that can't be DoS'd (either as a result of your robust server infrastructure or cost to your AWS/Akamai/CloudFlare account), don't attempt it.  A countdown clock is ripe for either hacking or breaking, and therefore causing confusion to the majority of people who aren't aware.  

Instead, recommend that people use multiple sites to check whether the block has passed 5,500,000 (if they are planning on selling right after CLO airdrop).

I would like to make a youtube channel talking about Ethereum Classic and its evolution as the main subject but also about blockchain evolution in general. The ETC teams have been working so hard, that it's hard to follow their news/announcements and everything they've been doing. I need help in order to be sure that I don't forget anything. My goal is to create a team of 3 to 5 members, each following different aspects of ETC (discussions on reddit, github, twitter, news, itw...) and gather all those informations in order to make videos in a regular basis to inform viewers on ETCs evolution and blockchain evolution in general (tech, macro...). If you have some knowledge on blockchain tech and you want to support ETC, let me know in the comments. Viewers will be able to donate to support the channel and allow it to grow and the donations will be distributed between the members helping the channel. 
This will not be a channel talking about prices or trying to pump coins. The channel will be called Cryptosophies (allready reserved with the domain name for the website where we gather all those informations) and the general approach will be the impact of blockchain in society. I really believe that ETC will have a massive impact on blockchain evolution (with Bitcoin, Cardano, Monero, Litecoin...), that's why I'm asking here for help. I don't want traders point of view beceause there are allready too many of them with youtube channels. I want people who are really interested in blockchain and I've come to the conclusion that this is the best place to find them.

So, are you in ?

PS : Other subjects of this channel will be blockchain education, avoid scams and phishing, use wallets... and generally, create informed users.",NA,"7z505f",NA,0,NA,"false",1520574557,"false","self","t5_3fgtx","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/EthereumClassic/comments/7z505f/can_you_help_me_promote_etc_and_blockchain/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

Now here's my criticisms, hopefully it can be taken constructively.

A few things about this release kinda bug me, I'm going to be open about those feelings:
* Until reaching the download page, it's unclear if there's One deadalus wallet with both Cardano and ETC in it. I would expect just one, otherwise what's the point, my ledger nano is just fine for ETC.

* It appears it's two seperate things, of which I can't use both at once. This is confusing. do I uninstall one before installing the other? Seems unprofessional to release like this.
Do not Install Daedalus Mantis with Daedalus for Cardano, the compatibility has not been finalized yet.

* The comment that says this:
This is pre release software connecting to the Ethereum Classic Mainnet by default, do not use with large amounts of ETC.

I'm sorry, but all my amounts are large amounts to me.... Is this supposed to be a 'test with some dust' type scenario? Why release it if it's not ready?

I'm being quite critical here, because I want to see things done in a very clean, professional and client facing way in the long term, and I feel this is representative of a small tech company releasing software to test out.",NA,"7uir9g",NA,0,NA,"false",1520470116,"false","self","t5_3fgtx","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/EthereumClassic/comments/7uir9g/mantis_deadalus_wallet/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

I created this pre synced blockchain because I wanted to make a node. As I started to set up a node and began syncing it has take hours to get to block 1 000 000. I thought ""okay I will just leave it and let it sync for some hours"" but nope.

##### There are many problems that slows down the node.
1. No peers
2. Slow disk (HDDs)
3. Slow internet speed
4. Blockchain spam attacks
##### [Slow syncing between 2 283 397 to 2 620 384](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/9883/why-is-my-node-synchronization-stuck-extremely-slow-at-block-2-306-843)
* 2,283,397 to 2,301,372 - geth memory crash transaction. geth clients crashed when processing these transactions.
* 2,283,416 to 2,379,641 - Low gas price spam transactions calling the EXTCODESIZE opcodes taking 20-60 seconds to validate due to the ~ 50,000 disk fetches needed to process each transaction.
* 2,421,507 to 2,463,130 - Account bloat transactions where 19 million empty accounts were created. This causes the node clients to slow down as the many accounts cannot be kept in cache requiring slow re-retrieval from disk.
* 2,468,209 to 2,474,792 - low impact transaction spam.
* 2,550,666 to 2,551,428 - low impact transaction spam continues.
* 2,619,660 to 2,620,384 - low impact transaction spam continues.

## Why you also should get a nod
* 1^st^ it's making the network more decentralized and bigger.
* 2^nd^ you can use it as a wallet.

## What I have used to make it
* **Parity [full sync = archive mode]**
* CPU : 8x 4,0GHz
* RAM : 16 GB
* Download : 100Mbit/s
* Upload : 10Mbit/s
* SSD : 500GB
* Synctime : ~3 days
* Compression time : 4h (**107GB &amp;gt;to&amp;gt; 97GB**)
* Uploadtime : 23h

## Want the pre synced Blockchain ?
You can download it but I can't just give it out like it's a 100MB file. I got a Server where you can download it from. Just send me a message on the [Forum](https://forum.ethereumclassic.org/u/MM_MarioMichel/summary) or on [Telegram](https://t.me/MarioMichel) any I will give you the page where you can download it from.

## Want to know how much time you safe ?

Ethereum Classic Callisto Fork","Ethereum Classic Fork, Callisto Network Token Airdrop countdown here: https://wp.me/P9CVDn-3VF

So the CLO airdrop is coming up. In the video I discuss where the CLO project came from, what the purpose of the Callisto token is, and how I'm playing the upcoming airdrop in light of the recent pump of ETC, as all airforks. I don't like the idea of chasing airdrops or hard forks unless I really like the project coming out.

However, it's always nice to receive crypto dividends. I've been a HODLer of ETC, and my long-term goals move well past the current coinsplit situation. However, if you haven't held ETC, and you're looking to get in the trade to profit, I give a cautionary tale of how I got burnt hodling NXT purely to enjoy the IGNIS airdrop. IGNIS hasen't yielded the profits that I've desired yet, and the price of NXT plummeted sharply before the airdrop. This is because traders rode the pump up knowing that people would buy it up in anticipation of the free cryptos they would receive, and then sold their shares at a nice profit point. The poor HODLers of NXT got hit twice, once by the first dumpers who dumped it before the airdrop, and then in again in the mad scramble immediately following the airdrop of people unloading their NXT to get out of a failing trade. Rough stuff.

Ethereum Classic Logo Transparent
Now I don't think ETC will drop as significantly or as long as NXT did, although that option is always a possibility. Listening to @MoneyTrigz on @bitcoinmeister the other day added another dimension to the scuttlebutt that's been kicked around about mining power switching to ETC when Ethereum makes the transition to Proof of Stake. In the video I show some surface sources that point to Jihan Wu (operator of the mining behemoth Bitmain) looking into Ethereum Classic as an alternative for ETH mining, Jeff Garzik's new ICO launching with ETC first instead of ETH, and Bitmain's news that it will be releasing ASIC F3 miners compatible with ETH in the second quarter of 2018. All of this interesting information leads us to a serious consideration of where the mining power would move from ETH if PoS was introduced, and ETC as a potential competitor and concurrently, a seriously undervalued coin.

At [TZ Libre](https://www.reddit.com/r/tzlibre/comments/7zov0a/announcing_tezos_libre/) we're working hard to infuse this philosophy into Tezos. Tezos is a great idea that is unfortunately being developed in a very centralized, trusted, corporate-ish way: 20% premined coins, lawsuits, copyrighted code, veto power, centralized leadership, inflation, no hard-cap, backdoor presales, etc. It's just a matter of time until Tezos's own DAO event.

As you explain well, blockchains are meant to be trustless. Anything else is a database at best, a scam at worst. This is even more true for Tezos, which has the potential for on-chain upgrades.

As some of you already know, we're forking DLS-Tezos to turn it into a real blockchain: trustless, hard-capped and immutable. 

After getting [thoughtful feedback](https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic/comments/80bhvz/infusing_etc_philosophy_into_tezos/) from your fellow members /u/shi-sato and /u/pyskell (feat. Vitalik) we decided to try our best to only use ETC as it's the coin we share most values with. 

* We now only accept ETC donations.
* We're looking for a Mandarin Chinese translator (with blockchain jargon expertise) to pay with ETC. Where do we put up an ETC bounty?

We look at your community as our older brother. Feel free to adopt us :)



PS

Sadly our sub is now private due to heavy trolling by the DLS-Tezos side. For the Telegram-inclined, we have [a public Telegram channel](http://t.me/tzlibre)

If you look at other similar cases, Ripple/ Stellar or Bitcoin/ Bcash, you see that they are much closer in value despite (in the case of Stellar at least) unimpressive market trading volume. Seems like ETC is way undervalued despite it being A) the original chain B) more committed to the original ideal of censorship resistance, and C) more community driven and less susceptible to administrative tampering.

I have some ETC on myetherwallet. I'm using metamask

I can see my balance on MEW by accessing the 'Network ETC (epool.io)' option in MEW. I also have a balance of ETH on the same address.

When I generate a transaction to send some ETC, Metamask tells me I have insufficient balance, but I know 100% that I have sufficient ETH balance to send it.

So - it looks like, when I am in Network ETC (epool.io) , Metamask cannot 'see' the ETH balance to enable me to send ETC!

Does anyone know how to deal with this?

Don't buy or hold ETC for CLO.

""CLO will never be more than 1 $ TOP. Just look at the whitepaper. Dev earn 500k CLO per MONTH.

I'm a front end dev, and even the react dev is 150k CLO per month. A front-end dev with experience earn something like 4-6k $ per month, because it's crypto let's say it's 10 k $, then do the math : 10 000 / 150 000 = 0.06 $ per CLO.

So 0.1 $ is clearly the extreme ""normal"" value of CLO. And this is with a ""bullish"" view of what a dev is earning in the real world.

Don't expect anything more than 0.1 $""

Trade with care and document yourself. Also from here : https://thecryptocheatsheet.com/2018/03/01/callisto-clo-overview-and-analysis/

""In the first 8 months after launch, over 8 times the number of CLO airdropped to ETC holders will be created. Also of note, developer rewards during the phase 1 will be greater than the initial airdrop to ETC holders. We expect this to put significant sell pressure on CLO at least until the cold staking smart contract is implemented in phase 2.""

Airdrop is only 100 000 000 CLO and in two years 6.5 Billions !

Again ! Don't buy ETC for CLO.","","81qjnh",NA,0,NA,"false",1522425369,"false","self","t5_3fgtx","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/EthereumClassic/comments/81qjnh/clo_price_just_to_be_clear_dont_trade_etc_because/","","",NA,"","",0,0

While using claymore, browsing the internet isn't so fluid as when claymore is not used. For example, I try to open a page, and it loads for 10-20 seconds than it fails, but it doesn't display network error, just stops loading. At that same moment when it stops, if I retry, it opens normally. This is cyclic, so it tends to repeat once a minute or two, so it is really annoying. Downloading stuff doesn't seam to be effected by this. Restarting router never helped. At 1st, I thought it was my connection problem, than when cable company checked my router, and tuned it, and problem stayed, I wasn't still aware what was going on. After restart, I was using the internet for 10 or more minutes before launching claymore, and I had no problems whatsoever. Pinging sites that gives me loading problems turns out without any packets losses, ping is 15... I am connected to internet via cable router, so no wifi...

The flaw is in how easy the ethereum network can be abuse..The problem stems from the abilty for anyone to create a token even by the same symbol and send it like spam mail to unwitting people. I will present to real cases that happend to me both whose intent was for marketing only and opened my eyes to how dangerous and unstopable it truly is.. The case involves both play2live and VinChain... Play2live and VinChain created tokens with no intended use or value to the recepient. Its only purpose was for marketing nothing else attached no coupon no try before you buy nothing just wasted space in your wallet..The addresses they chose to use were random. This was an unsolisited airdrop of pure junk... STOP because I need you to grasp what this means now... A contract by anyone can easyly be created with the intent to send junk to any number of addresses... Like your junk email box imagine thousands of junk token filling your ether wallet.. Even with the same or similar symbol as a legit ICO you had participated in.. What are you options.. Transfer you legit tokens and coins, costing you gas and flooding the network with junk addresses. Sending junk token back to sender if you can costing you gas...

[Callisto network](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/go-callisto).

#### *Rationale:*

- Free security auditing of smart-contracts.

- Cold staking implementation.

- Crosschain interactions research.

#### *Here you can track the progress:*

- [GO implementation of Callisto](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/go-callisto)

- [Rust implementation of Callisto (Parity port)](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/parity/commit/01fc560f0d0482fcae3e3af64a06f6104add519a)

- [Callisto Network status](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Roadmap/issues/42)

- [Callisto forum threads](https://forum.ethereumclassic.org/c/callisto-network)

#### **Summary:**

We are preparing to make a snapshot at `5 500 000` block of ETC blockchain. Callisto mainnet will **NOT** be launched immediately at the snapshot date. We are not going to rush and launch as soon as possible and I am not going to focus on marketing efforts before the technical side fully meet our requirements.

Exchanges: I have informed exchanges about the upcoming airdrop so that they can prepare and announce their position. Remember that Coinbase lists BitcoinCash much later than it was launched https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/articles/2911542.

There are two options for exchanges: (1) support Callisto and grant to users or (2) hold it for themselves. Technically, every exchange will receive CLO at their balances.

Wallets: [ClassicEtherWallet](https://ethereumproject.github.io/etherwallet/) is the wallet that will officially support CLO. Technically, every address, that had ETC at the moment of 5500000 block, will receive CLO. If you control the private key of your address then you will be able to manage your CLO after the mainnet launch.

Block explorer: Ethereum Commonwealth Blockchain explorer (Galileo) is in development. [Guarda team](https://guarda.co/) offers to establish their own version of a block explorer for Callisto.

Web page: We are currently focusing on technical part (CLI clients), not the marketing. We are far from mainnet launch now. Callisto web page will be announced later.

Team: Unfortunately, Eduard Tua left our team. A whitepaper will be updated soon. It will provide an updated description of the team and a more detailed process of smart-contract auditing.

# 2. Ethereum Commonwealth bounty program is now closed.

#### *Rationale:*

- The Bounty program proves to be ineffective.

#### **Summary:**

[Ethereum Commonwealth bounty program](https://dexaran.github.io/EthereumCommonwealth/Bounties/) is shutted down. We will no longer keep a list of community bounties. Later on, we will announce a specific bounty for each project of Ethereum Commonwealth separately.

# 3. [ClassicEtherWallet](https://ethereumproject.github.io/etherwallet/)

#### *Rationale:*

- Maintaining and improving ETC web wallet and smart-contract interaction service

#### *Here you can track the progress:*

- [EtherWallet maintenance proposal](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Roadmap/issues/43)

- [ClassicEtherWallet](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/etherwallet) github repo at Ethereum Commonwealth

- [ClassicEtherWallet](https://github.com/ethereumproject/etherwallet/tree/gh-pages) gh-pages branch

#### **Summary:**

New features:

- Deploying contracts with constructor parameters

- New ETC RPC nodes: Commonwealth-Geth, Commonwealth-Parity and Commonwealth-Mantis

- New supported networks: POA, TOMO, ELLA

- Auto evaluation of `gasprice` when deploying contracts

- ClassicEtherWallet 3.11.0 downloadable version is released: https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/etherwallet/releases/tag/v3.11.0

# 4. Ethereum Classic official Multisig wallet contract.

#### *Rationale:*

- Provide a secure implementation of Multisig wallet for Ethereum Classic

#### *Here you can track the progress:*

- [ETC multisig](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/ethereum-classic-multisig) github repo

- [ETC multisig](https://gist.github.com/Dexaran/2389d5e7290ab69709d33abfe0485bec) audit report

#### **Summary:**

The multisig wallet was established at Ethereum Commonwealth github organization. Security audit and bug bounty passed.

NOTE: The described multisig wallet contains superfluous functionality and I'd like to make a modified and simplified version of it later.

# 5. Galileo blockchain explorer.

#### *Rationale:*

- A new blockchain explorer with advanced features for smart-contract developers and crosschain naming service support (DexNS).

#### *Here you can track the progress:*

- [Galileo](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Galileo) github repo

#### **Summary:**

Blockchain explorer is still in development. We faced some problems with Geth. It was decided to use Parity as backend node for this block explorer.

# Financial transparency

[Ethereum Commonwealth](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/) is a completely financially transparent Ethereum CLassic development team.

Here you can see a full history of financial operations since the very beginning: [financial report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-ibJXI9IfrkKloLgN6RHxoXeCbdqa9mti1afTcO1BQk/edit#gid=979560349).

Donations for further ETC development are always appreciated: [0x52823e725a34d42e14a1b66fb67299C30c4d8Edf](http://gastracker.io/addr/0x52823e725a34d42e14a1b66fb67299c30c4d8edf)

Smart contracts require gas. The reason they require gas is to pay the miners who spend computation time executing the smart contracts. 

Currently, everybody executes the smart contract when a user sends money/instructions to it. It is one of the great strengths of ethereum. It is also a bottleneck. What if instead of every computer executing a smart contract, only 25% of the network ran the contract code? What if only 10%? 5%? There are still hundreds of nodes running the code, so any malfeasance by a node or a set of nodes is still easily detectable. 

So, here is how this works: The network splits itself up into a set of delegate pools of active nodes for a period of time (say a day) Then, each delegate pool has a small set of communication nodes elected for that pool's day. All nodes in the network see the communication nodes, all communication nodes see every single node in their own pool. All communication nodes within a pool are assigned a random value. 

When a new contract is pushed to the blockchain, all nodes get it (as they do currently) When somebody then executes that contract, their execution statement is hashed, and the pool that has the closest hash value is chosen. The reason for this scheme is that it neatly sidesteps the byzantine generals problem, and replaces it with identical pool selection for execution, ensuring that no transaction runs on multiple pools by mistake.

The pool then executes the smart contract. The pool reports the execution results to the communication nodes. The communication nodes then make a judgement call: if every node in the pool has identical output, then the transaction is considered completely valid. If not, the transaction requires execution by the old ethereum classic method of running on every single node in the entire network. If the transaction is valid, the communication nodes broadcast the transaction to every node on the network, and those nodes record the transaction. Hence the term delegated proof of computation. If it did not finish in a valid execution, the communication nodes (and every node in the pool) let the entire network know that the transaction failed and everyone needs to verify it. 

Possible drawbacks:
An attacker could deliberately badly execute a transaction, resulting in that specific node group having to have the network validate all their transactions, degrading the network speed back to normal, and ruining this speed improvement. 

Advantages: 
Currently, the etc network processes transactions in a linear fashion. This is the equivalent of introducing multithreading to the network, allowing it to process contracts in parallel. It will reduce gas costs, increase network throughput, and give etc an edge against eth's plan of having sub chains with the main chain acting as the arbiter of the subchain.

So with 25% drop in price (was $28.55 - now $21.34), why so many ppl still mine ETC and not switch to ETH????

As [previously announced here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic/comments/7fvr2o/some_changes_are_coming_to_ethereum_classic_and/) we are planning to move the donation funds which were previously under bitnovosti's control to a new donation contract.

The new contract is deployed here: http://gastracker.io/addr/0x48dbda9443746a99ef1b26ab01dd94ac50d7014b

We've completed testing and wanted to make everyone aware prior to bitnovosti sending over the funds which are currently held at this address: https://gastracker.io/addr/0xe9a7e26bf5c05fe3bae272d4c940bd7158611ce9

The final list of signers are all long standing members of the ETC community: Myself, Cody, Elaine, D34D, OmniEdge, snaproll, and MikO

The contract will require a minimum of 3 approvals in order to transfer funds.

Bitnovosti will be sending over 16,384 ETC which is the balance of the donation account less the amount that the DAO hacker once sent to it (1,000 ETC).

We don't have any immediate plans for the funds but hope they can be used in the future to improve the ETC ecosystem.

But lots of them where lacking expected functionality and easy of use.
It's just a calculator after all :D

&amp;nbsp;

Also I was involved in crypto mining long time ago and helped lots of people get involved, learn something and make some money.
Some of the most often questions I was hearing where something like: 
&gt;What coin should I mine?

&gt;Is Ethereum better than Ellaism?

&gt;Is Musicoin better than Ethereum Classic?

&amp;nbsp;

So, to answer this and similar questions, I assembled a small developer team and started working from zero. 
As a result, we recently developed Cryptocus, neat mining profitability calculator.

&amp;nbsp;

You can check it right here: [https://cryptocus.com/#4GnEiwWD](https://cryptocus.com/#4GnEiwWD)

(On this link I already added ETC and ETH comparison as a showcase of a little neat share functionality)

&amp;nbsp;

It's an MVP, it has some bugs, and there is a lot of work to do on improving and adopting it to user needs.

&amp;nbsp;

Please tell me what you think, and feel free to post a suggestion.

We're developers behind another blockchain project. Recently, we found out that many of our users need to interact with multiple Ethereum networks. However, all of our current geth clients developed by different teams only support one network, and it has been a frustration to use multiple binaries, manage data store folder, etc. What's more, we learned that a lot of new geth features, such as snappy compression, are not available in many of the geth clients because of the difficulty to merge upstream changes.

As a result, we developed `multi-geth`. This is a go-ethereum client forked from Ethereum Foundation's version, aimed to follow closely for upstream changes, and support multiple Ethereum networks. We have just added alpha support for Ethereum Classic network. And we're grateful if the Ethereum Classic community is interested in testing it out!

Our project page is at Github: https://github.com/ellaism/multi-geth

The Ethereum Classic support has not been released yet so you need to build it from source right now. Install golang version 1.10, and run.

    cd multi-geth
    make geth

By default, it connects to Ethereum. To connect to Ethereum Classic, simply pass `--classic` flag, like below:

    ./build/bin/geth --classic

We would appreciate any feedback, bug reports, or pull requests!","false","88y77k",NA,0,NA,"false",1529533361,"false","self","t5_3fgtx","false","",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/EthereumClassic/comments/88y77k/multigeth_a_goethereum_client_with_support_of/","t3_88y77k",NA,NA,"GLORIOUS","",0,0

The founder of trust wallet explains it really well in this video.

Trust wallet is building deep linking in between dApps. and is trying to become more of the apple app store of Dapps.

It is always nice to talk to someone who is involved in the same passions as yourself. I created https://junktion.io with the intent to spread adoption of cryptocurrency.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNCzzUWOJmc&amp;t

In this video, I sit down and talk to Viktor the founder of the popular Mobile ethereum wallet, Trust wallet. In order to get a better understanding of his product and vision. This is a great talk for anyone interested in marketing their Dapp, creating one, and what the future might look like in ethereum and cryptocurrency as a whole. I am glad other people want to push adoption and that is the number one thing that will drive the entire industry.

Check out trust wallet. It is totally safe because it stores your keys locally. You can visit their website at https://trustwalletapp.com/

Do you have a Cryptocurrency project? I would love to do a similar interview. Email me info@junktion.io

The 101 series episodes are meant to tackle projects from the ground up as much as we can as a group that doesn't know a thing about coding. 

[You can find the episode here](https://www.cryptobasicpodcast.com/home/etc)

If you're happy with the content, I'll be back to post our interview with Anthony Lusardi tomorrow (Director of the Ethereum Classic Cooperative). 

We recorded the episode and the interview last week before the difficulty bomb was removed, so I regret that we weren't able to cover that. We take a look at every coin 100 days after originally post it and see if we can add it to an updates episode. 

We always screw SOMETHING up so feel free to correct us and we'll issue a correction on the Friday Flagship :) We like good feedback too of course!

Hope this message finds you well!

As it was announced earlier, Zeniex has signed MOU with the Ethereum Classic Cooperative (ECC) - the  organization established to enhance Ethereum Classic (ETC) related projects.

Through this partnership, Zeniex will start to work with the Asian investors' community across South Korea, China and Japan.

We are planning to support various promotion activities in order to strengthen and contribute into ETC ecosystem.

To commemorate this partnership, Zeniex is holding ETC fee free event until September! (Start trading ETC on Zeniex with no service fees applied https://www.zeniex.com)

ETCgame is a wager platform based on the blockchain technology that was officially launched on May 15, 2018.

ETCgame is the first platform to use ETC as a means of payment. All transactions are recorded on the Ethereum Classic blockchain and can be openly monitored by anyone to ensure transparency of the forecasting process. Unlike the existing wager platforms that deal only with a single item various categories (sports, games, finance, entertainment and e-sports) are supported.

Recent update from June 1, 2018 expanded the use of the BTC, ETH, BCH, and EOS in addition to ETC on the platform.
Currently, ETCgame is available without any fees applied. More information about ETCgame can be found on the official website: https://www.etcgame.com

A lot of great things happening now to ETC (including Coinbase listing and new pairs on Binance). Zeniex is looking forward for your interest and support to ETC development and expansion.

I've been mining ETC on either nanopool or ethermine since around March, and almost always my reported hashrate is very close to the same as the ""current calculated hashrate"". The last 48 hours have been extremely weird though - my current hashrate is drastically different than my reported hashrate , and I don't have an explanation as to why.

My reported hashrate in ethermine and nanopool almost always closely match what I see in my SMOS miner console (approximately 500MH/s). However, my ""current calculated"" hashrate by the pool is only \~300MH/s after approximately 48 hours of mining. I've tried rebooting rigs/basic troubleshooting steps, with the same results.

Have any miners noticed anything similar in the last couple of days? I've never seen such a big discrepancy before (sometimes I'll see discrepancies of +/- 10MH/s between reported and current calculated, but never a \~200MH/s difference over a prolonged period of time).",NA,"8tms3o",NA,0,NA,"false",1536440754,"false","self","t5_3fgtx","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/EthereumClassic/comments/8tms3o/nanopoolethermine_reported_hashrate_vs_current/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

During the mega (irrational)bull market in December, BCH was added to Coinbase on December the 19th, 1 day later BCH hit it's all time almost doubling in the space of 24 hours going from a market cap of 36B to 66B. Those who kept hold of their BCH afterwards essentially became bagholders. I have no intention of becoming a bagholder.

When ETC classic is added we shouldn't expect the same results as BCH because BCH was added to Coinbase during the most irrational bull maket of the 21st century, people are not as blind sited as they were then, well most of them anyway. 

I am personally going to dump within 6-12 hours of it being listed and I recommend those of you who are just in it for the money to do the same, once again sorry for the people who actually really like ETC.

But with recent news outlets citing that ETC will be supported in the near future, I'd think the first question for many newcomers would have is: what's the difference between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic (myself included initially). I know interested potential members would just do a simple Google search to find the answer but it doesn't help with mass adoption.

Which brings me to my original question, did we miss our chance to rebrand ETC? I know rebranding is no easy feat.,  time + resources would be taken away for other productive tasks and rebranding can still be done later if the project wanted to take that direction. But I'm thinking we could take advantage of this inflection point to rebrand and differentiate ourselves from ETH more to attract more newcomers to our community as this coin is being introduced to new exchanges/markets.

These are just my thoughts and it's all speculative. What are your thoughts on it? ",NA,"8ugfg5",NA,0,NA,"false",1536454663,"false","self","t5_3fgtx","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/EthereumClassic/comments/8ugfg5/did_we_miss_our_chance_to_rebrand/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

I think there may be a very slim chance I can claim this ETC. Basically I need confirmation of a few things, though.

So I originally purchased Ethereum mid 2016, around the time of the DAO crash. My original transaction occurred around block 1730000, long before the fork block. I sat on the ETH until April 2017 when I transferred it to an exchange and sold it. I didn't realize I also owned ETC, so in doing this I'm gathering (from the ETC block explorer) that the transactions also occurred on the ETC blockchain.

I'm wondering what has actually happened to that ETC balance? Has that ended up in the hands of the exchange, on their trading address? I'm thinking about putting in a claim for that ETC, but not sure about the dynamics of this. No high hopes that I'll get anything out of this, but it's worth a shot.

Any clarification would be appreciated. Thanks.

New ETC hodl'er here and in it for the long haul!

I was curious as to the numerous ways the blockchain could be utilized in today's time. One question which I cannot seem to find a proper answer to is: Could the blockchain be utilized for political purposes such as voting? If ""code is law"" then I would assume that it would help reduce fraud or fake counts since it would all be recorded on the blockchain for all to see. I am in no way as tech-savvy as some of you here so I was hoping some of you could explain the many cool uses for a blockchain when it comes to politics, medicine, and shopping.

Also, dumb question but asking anyways, are all blockchains essentially the same? Or do they all have different protocols when it comes to maintaining the blockchain?",NA,"8vmzer",NA,0,NA,"false",1536474816,"false","self","t5_3fgtx","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/EthereumClassic/comments/8vmzer/etc_blockchain_utilized_for_politics/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

First some background: There is general agreement that because this move has been announced prior to the actual listing, and people are already filling their bags, that when it is listed the price won't rise dramatically like it did in the past with Bcash and Litecoin. I disagree with this stance and will outline why later in the post.

There is also a general concensus that when ETH implements their proof of stake system that there will be a mass migration of hashpower onto the ETC network. It is theorised that this could also bring the price up considerably too.

Given these external factors along with the recent boost in development ETC has received from their dev team I see the stars aligning for ETC this year. 

Going back to the point I made in the second paragraph I believe that Coinbase outlining that they will list ETC but not announcing a specific date for the listing will not detract from the potential of a rapid price rise but will actually aid it. What I mean by this is that with everyone poised for the listing, if Coinbase choose to not announce a date and just go ahead and silently list it, you can almost gaurentee a huge fomo reaction from unwitting investors driving the price right up. If this move was timed to co-incide with the POS switch over (which I think it may well be) the price rise could be astronomical and with the dev team in place to resolve any issues that may arise along the way I think it will be pretty smooth sailing for  ETC the rest of 2018.

Recently they had to cut off all NSFW sites that they were servicing (I believe due to investors) and I had to find an alternative. That turned out to be a blessing in disguise because I stumbled across CoinPayments who offers wayyyyy more coin options. We now accept ETC and some of the other top coins as well!

1. You buy into the contract by purchasing tokens, every token purchased increases the token price by a set amount.(0.00000001 ETC)
2. 10% of what you spend to buy the token gets distributed proportionally to all other token holders.
3. When you sell your token, 10% of what you would get back gets distributed to all other token holders proportionally, and the global price per token goes down by the set amount.

This game is completely autonomous, and has no human intervention whatsoever. It is regulated entirely via a smart contract on Ethereum Classic.

**Interested? Here’s how to play**: 

* Acquire Ethereum Classic: you can trade BTC or ETH on Binance for it.
* Download the [Saturn wallet](https://saturn.network/saturn-wallet), which is similar to Metamask.
* Go to [P3C.io](https://p3c.io/), and buy tokens to start playing. See [screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/TSrlraP).
* Check the site periodically, and you can choose to either withdraw your dividends, or reinvest them by buying more tokens and growing the community. Or you can choose to sell and leave the community...

**Why did we choose Ethereum Classic?** 

Because we believe this game has the potential to grow to many players all over the world, we wanted to launch it on a chain that we know is immutable. Ethereum Classic is that blockchain. At some point in the future, people could be entrusting their savings to P3C, and we want to make sure that trust is deserved.

**Want to know how it works?** 

* Read the [smart contract](https://etherhub.io/addr/0xdf9aac76b722b08511a4c561607a9bf3afa62e49#tab_addr_3).
* Watch [this youtube video](https://youtu.be/gDpOTL_KKys) on how the original P3D contract works. It’s long but it explains it in great detail.
* Join [our community](https://discord.gg/crjsdJr) here.

*P.S. We have a surprise planned for when we have 10 participants, or in 72 hours, whichever comes first.*

Well, long story short I was able to get hold of it and it's worth several hundred dollars. (Ironically, it's worth even more than what I paid for the original ETH.) The question is: Do I keep it and why? ETH is already established, so why would anyone even bother with ETC? Is there a site that lists dapps being developed for use on ETC? Is ETC just a backup in case ETH goes wrong? I'm half tempted to keep it as I feel like it's my lucky coin now. :)

Fuck i might have to buy mine back now lool , hardware wallets i think will really take off soon and keeping an eye on them can help assessing the market , Qtum I kept hearing about but dismissed ( im not saying buy it lol ) but seeing coins like that and ETC looking so pretty and ready to be used ( ok that sounds dodgy lol ) has made me purchase some , in fact my ETC just arrived . It really is a lovley looking wallet but using it is a real pleasure  , Ive updated the firmware once and the only problems have been slightly dodgy english lost in translation as it were.

There's no option inside the app to change the file path and no option to install the program to a different location during installation.

FIXED: found a way round it using symmover or  alternatively manually changing Geth file path.

Over the past six months been watching and reading loads of information streaming through reddit. And I’ve noticed that ETC has been flying low under the radar compared to a lot of other projects, which is great it’s how the dev team works no hype about what they are doing but just working hard making the project stronger and complete tasks with dedication. Slowly but surely the build up for ETC feels like a giant slowly building up power. I’d rather spend my time with a project that builds a solid foundation than one that builds a solid hype. Like with Bitcoin. It was built without hype yet has been around for more than ten years and has withstood every test thrown at it. This is how it feels from the ETC dev team building a strong reliable blockchain to sustain itself long into the future. I know this is a far stretch but I could compare ETC’s future to that of Bitcoin strong reliable and solid. The sleeping giant of dapps. 

This is just my personal sentiment and I wish to express my gratitude to the dev team and all those involved in continuing to put their hard work and expertise into ETC. Thank You!

Speculative trading in ETC was made based on previous Coinbase listing that was BCH. Most people speculating was not actually interested in ETC, the technology and the roadmap. People were in for a quick profit. 

Big players thoughts:

1. Market conditions are different than when BCH was listed, less favourable.
2. BCH pump was due to Coinbase not having enough liquidity on GDAX (now called Coinbase Pro). This was fixed by Coinbase this time, by allowing ETC volume to move in before launching on blue app.
3. Coinbase announced ETC in advanced, each step with accuracy. That is a big difference from BCH listing.
4. ETC is one of the coins with already high trade volume on several exchanges. It was unlikely that Coinbase would affect the total ETC price. 

Small players thought:

1. BCH was pumped, the same will happen to ETC. Who cares about ETC and its dev team and roadmap, I’m in for a quick buck.

What happend:

1. ETC was pumped and dumped a couple of times before actual listing. 
2. Big players earned money on pump and dumps.
3. Small players got disappointed, some sold, some are not giving up on hope for a pump.
4. This subreddit got flooded with Coinbase threads like this one, not really helping ETC community. 

So now what? Who knows, I don’t, and if I did I would not have time to write this post. But the logical thing would be that ETC valuation would be based on the same principals as before the Coinbase listing. Coinbase listing has exposed ETC to more possible owners/traders, but the effect of that is hard to measure.

Good luck all crypto enthusiasts ��

Granted BTC is following the same suit and ETC value is tied to BTC price, still looking into ETC 4 hour chart clearly shows the RSI is close to being undersold and the MACD lines for long are about to cross, it is wise for all ETC Retail community to follow the smart money now which is #1 start buying to accumulate more ETC at a cheap undersold price and for smart money is HODL ETC until the massive pump that will sure to come in the coming days and weeks.  They are building long liquidity in order for them to sell their ETC for the short term gains and im sure that the price of ETC will after the massive pump will see another massive dump since we are in a  crypto bear market for 2018 that unfortunately be bearish past sept. 30th since SEC will delay once again for final decision to be made no later then February 2019.

Hi,

I've been learning about the DAO and how that led to the hard-fork, but I'm not aware of any ways Ethereum and Ethereum Classic differ apart from maintaining a different chain. Would appreciate if anynone could write a quick list of the major differences.

Some of the differences I'm curious about are:

Does ETC use Solidity?

Does ETC use ERC-20?

Does ETC plan on implementing PoS/Casper?

How big is ETC's development and is it being actively developed?

​

EDIT:

Here's a list of what I've figured out so far thanks to the comments. Keep adding in the comments below and I'll make a nice summary of it at the top. I really appreciate it!

Difference 1: ETC has no plans to implement any sort of PoS in the future, so Casper is not being implemented. PoW is considered to be the most secure and decentralised way of validating transactions despite the power inefficiency.

Difference 2: ETC has decided to implement a limited supply (I found a source saying it was 210 million but let me know if that's wrong). Whereas ETH has no limit in its supply. On that note, ETH is currently trying to lower its block reward to lower inflation but they risk disincentivising miners.",NA,"9af8kd",NA,0,NA,"false",1536809053,"false","https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/9OdXmmIlcjVBQkbf6gqGZ5s6_zP8KDm3mZGn7JT1PFk.jpg","t5_3fgtx","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/EthereumClassic/comments/9af8kd/in_what_ways_has_etc_differentiated_itself_from/",NA,"","false","","",0,1

Obviously we’re all extremely frustrated with the garbage market and investor sentiment.

I’ve been thinking and looking at the candle sticks, specifically on CB Pro, it appears as if massive whales are consistently dumping/placing sell orders to keep price hovering around 15-16 USD support levels.

Why would this be the case? 

The ONLY assumption I can make of it is that since Main CB listing hasn’t occurred, whales are keeping price low so that when it does hit, normal folks buy the hell out of ETC. 

Thoughts? This is the only reason I can assume ETC specifically is stagnating.

Ethereum Classic is an independent community driven blockchain continued after EF (a foundation originally started Ethereum blockchain) moved to a separate fork by introducing censoring transactions into their blockchain. Ethereum Classic community opposed that fork and kept original chain, because it believes in principles of blockchain.

We’re maintaining and adding new features to the go-ethereum client (Geth). This is a reference implementation of Ethereum Classic protocol, written - you guessed it - in Go.

## Job Description
We need a person to join the Geth project, who has experience making architectural and design recommendations. The ideal candidate will have prior experience with blockchain and cryptocurrencies, and be comfortable to work in a fully distributed development team.

## Requirements
- 7 years of software development experience with computer languages such as C/C++, Java, Python, Go, Haskell or OCaml (at least one)
- 2 years of Go programming experience
- Experience with Rust is big plus
- Familiar with Git and Linux
- Proficient with spoken/written English, excellent communications skills
- Good practices documenting, writing and maintaining clean code
- Track record of Open Source contributions
- Experience of building distributed applications
- Self motivated, can take initiative and feel comfortable both working alone and part of a team

What this means is that our 750,000+ global users will be able to purchase or sell ETC for cash, as well as access advanced functionalities.

U.CASH is building a global network of local and online converters that enables anyone to load up their account with cash, access multiple services, and when complete, cash-out.

The vast majority of our users have never owned any cryptocurrency before and hail mostly from areas such as South/South-East Asia and South America. As such, we have embarked on various initiatives to make using cryptocurrencies easier and more intuitive. One such initiative is our Wallet ID program.

We believe simple, easy to remember and share addresses, are the future of seamless payments. Wallet IDs are subdomains built under the main TLD EthereumClassic.xyz. You can claim yourname.EthereumClassic.xyz and use that to receive payments online or through the U.CASH platform to start. We are developing APIs that can be used by other providers to access the same capability as well. On top of that, multiple other features including domain forwarding, brand building sites and more are planned in the pipeline for Wallet IDs.

Other services that U.CASH currently offers is exchange top-ups (currently available for instant loads to C2CX), where after loading up your account with cash, you can the transfer that balance to your exchange account. In the future we will be enabling cash-out from exchanges as well.

The U.CASH mission is to integrate promising cryptocurrencies, global exchanges and financial service providers together with our converter network to provide users with a wide variety of innovative abilities. Wallet IDs are the first step in this integration process.

To find out more about this initiative please visit EthereumClassic.xyz for our teaser informational site. In the future we will build a more comprehensive portal that will be sure to become a great resource for the community.

Pre-register your U.CASH account to be eligible for early access. When registering and verifying your account, you receive some UCASH as a bounty. In many cases this bounty is enough to claim your Wallet ID for free!

If you have any questions please feel free to ask in this thread, join our telegram, or send us an email to walletid @ u.cash.

We are a group of 4 software developers that are all miners. We decided to use our development background to start a pool and slowly add features that we wanted to see in other pools. Any feedback or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  We have also built an open source GPU mining/monitoring software app that we call BPM that is also ETC compatible [https://bitpoolmining.com/bpm](https://bitpoolmining.com/bpm).  Our goal has been to build cool software and to help the community whenever we can.  We set out to build software for 'one click mining' that can help ease setup for ETC mining for new/small miners and also provide tools powerful enough for mining farms.  We are a new and super tiny pool right now, be we are not going anywhere anytime soon.

Their price has dropped some, but at its core, the concept that iota brings of a method of consensus, scaling, and computation outside of blockchain is beautiful. A shame it doesn't deal with memory so well. More on that and etc later.

Etc is at its core an arbiter of states of a virtual machine. It is in essence a law book, and you can create tokens on eth and etc because it is copy pasted everywhere. It has a history.

Another thing though is that etc does not have a real economic output right now (unlike eth) because the startup market has been completely captured by eth. At the moment, iota doesn't have an economic output either, and its price in relation to etc is abysmally low, because it is free to transact, without mining fees.

Enter Qubic and Peaq. This is where iota gets weird, and where etc has a potential chance to overtake eth... IF ETC CAPITALIZES ON IOTA. So, qubic can be compared to an ethereum shard of minimum size. For example, if you had an eth shard with only 3 machines as validators, that is almost identical from a computational standpoint to a single qubic quorum. Basically a qubic quorum is a machine where a clear 2/3rds majority can be found. They execute some code, and then they vote on the output, reaching consensus of output through 2/3rds majority. Qubic is not out yet, but its in development, just like sharding and plasma is for eth. The key thing to remember here is that 1, qubic is turing complete, and 2 the iota tangle has no permanent memory. Snapshots delete history (which is insane but bear with me)

Peaq is an on iota protocol that allows for new tokens to be created on iota, meaning it can capitalize on iota's consensus protocol to offer new tokens that are just as free of fees as iota's is. Where does ETC come in? Iota snapshots delete history, and qubic computations are computationally cheaper than superbroad consensus by running every single etc transaction through etc. But iota has no history! Etc and blockchains in general do.

So, does that mean buy iota? Right now? No. Iota is in the dumps, and it is probably going to keep falling like a rock until they get qubic up and running. However, once qubic is up and running, iota will have a game changer that can issue tokens with the same consensus power as blockchain, but faster and cheaper. The only cost will be a lack of memory. And that is where the first blockchain to step in will get a massive boost from iota's gains. Iota needs a way to provide for memory. Blockchains can handle that massive memory requirement, easy peasy.

So, why etc? Well, for one, I hold etc I bought at 17, and I don't want it to go lower. I want etc to moon to 400 like eth did. Second, etc is morally in the right place. Code is law. If a hacker breaks in, you don't fork etc, you patch the hole, and make sure it never happens again. Not everything is possible, but everything is permitted.

So what is needed to make this happen? Well, if your a dev, you should look at iota's iri, and look at etc's solidity. I think that what will be the game changer is if you can secure an iota wallet in the etc blockchain. Why? well, if you can do that, then peaq will not call from whatever the iota devs dream up as an alternative to blockchain memory. Peaq will call from etc nodes. Which means that peaq tokens are suddenly paying gas to move around. voila! miners get more profit for mining etc, and gas prices go up. then the etc token price goes up and suddenly, you have mega corporations launching their tokens on iota, and sure iota goes to the moon at that point...

But so does etc. And that is something to think about. Hard. Right now there is a race to be had, but few to none know that the race between blockchains is on. Unlike most who think that its a race between blockchains and tangle, its more of a race of which blockchain integrates tangle first. And now....

You know.

First at all, a lot of pesimism, trolling and joking from the own comunity talking about Etc.  
Now we had a good spike and people trying to minimize it with nosense explanations..  


My explanation..   
First..  
Why is not just a bull phase while Etc is added to CB? So, this bull phase can be 1 day (if listed tomorrow), or seven days.  Of course we can fall a bit if Bitcoin fall more, but we will not fall double like last week, but half. And probably also pump double or more if btc pump.  
Just people taking positions inside the coin for being inside when its listed, wanting to be in for a posible pump inside CB in the first hours (like with other coins).  


  
Second, and more important.. Lots of people talking about such a bear Bitcoin market.. And it seems this is a missunderstanding about how markets works..  
Try to find about acumulation phase of Wickoff, and you will see we copied the draw during those six months in phase A, B, C and this last D.   
Acumulation phase is totally diferent than bear market!   
D Phase is the last. We can jump already from 5800 mark, or bitcoin could go a bit lower to 5400, even 4900 (and a bit more if panic). Mean Support area from the first steps of the parabola 1 year back.  
And YES. This is exactly how Acumulation phase of Wickoff works in Phase D.  And this bottom is a Pivot point for go up and go out from acumulation phase looking for tops.  
This not mean we will go to 20.000 again. Mean we probably would test first 11.000 in september-december.  And we will see if we can pass or not and where we would put.  


I think panic from many people not knowing about how those phases works, made a huge sell off from alts in the last Bitcoin bottom to 5800..   
Positive here? We had the oportunity to buy REAL CHEAP. So stop being troll against your own holdings (etc coin), and pesimistic. And say this will take several months to recover, or bitcoin will go to sub 0..    
Because basically the phase D in a perfectly draw Acumulation Phase of Wickoff is the begining of a very nice grow incoming.. If you see the market dumping to 5000 we will jump from there as a bottom of the year and pivoting to new tops. No ""long time needed"", no ""several months to recover""..  
And do you know what means this bitcoin jump for Etc with all the news in front?? You can guess..

That is the question we, a research team from University Institute of Lisbon (ISCTE-IUL), are studying. Considering 10 different dimensions, from perceived usefulness to privacy to profitability, among others. For that we need your help to answer a questionnaire regarding your experience with cryptocurrencies.

Here is the link for the questionnaire r/[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/cryptocurrencies\_usage](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/cryptocurrencies_usage)

More details:

For this, it was created a questionnaire with Likert type scale questions. This questionnaire has some focus on the financial area, but this does not mean it is the most important. We know there are some other dimensions not being addresses in this questionnaire, such as decentralisation/government influence, that may be addressed in the future. It takes on average 3 minutes to answer. Your input is really important for this research and to help us and other researchers to boost academic knowledge in this area. After analysing and publishing the thesis and papers I will post here again with infographics and the most important conclusions of the study.

There are no open questions, but you can message me or post in the comments if you feel so. Thank you all for your participation!

Only 5 coins I think are on the index so :

index value / 5 = amount of ETC they have to buy

In other news. You should buy ETC under $30. If ETC reaches similar marketcap to the coins on coinbase, ie LTC, than ETC will be around $30.

To go against the FUD saying coinbase has a TON of ETC they want to dump, thats why they are listing it. Well, ETH wasnt on Coinbase when the fork happened. So they do not have a ton of ETC unless they bought it. 

But, we can assume THEY DID BUY A BUNCH OR HAVE A BUNCH. Who cares, they need to make money to keep the exchange running. 


Edit: Recent high was around $18, BEFORE COINBASE ANNOUNCMENT - So we can assume that we are just starting the climb.

One of the main reasons is that crypto space is very risky and another reason is that most people don’t even know how to get started yet. Solution! Simulate the real world crypto trading without putting in your money using Coinseed app.

Coinseed app lets you invest your spare change in crypto and they are announcing a new feature called Play Mode. With this new feature, you can now simulate the real world trading without actually putting in any money. It's a free feature.

Here’s how it works. First, take a minute to signup on Coinseed app. This signup process is by far the fastest way to get started with crypto. Then you can switch to the Play Mode and put in “play” money. Now you can simply select the coins to invest and see how your “investment” performs in the real world. That simple. It’s a very effective way to learn about cryptos because real learning happens when you actually do it. 

Learning how to invest in crypto takes time and practice just like any other skill. The trick is to make it fun so that you can be little more persistent. Share your learning process with others and learn from your peers as well. You can do this by seeing what other people on Coinseed are investing in real time and you can discuss your ideas on the Coinseed platform as well. Hey, you can even read crypto news there!

In conclusion, a lot of people are intrigued by cryptos but afraid of the high risk. Well, Coinseed’s Play Mode just might make it a little less intimidating. Once you get more comfortable with crypto investing then you can simply switch to Coinseed’s regular mode which will let you invest your real money with the least hassle.

2. POW is actually the safest system to secure the blockchain as of the moment. ETH is shifting to POS and I believe it is not an easy task and the risk is very high. POS system is not yet been proven to securely run the ETH blockchain.
3. ETC will stick to POW and have a limited supply of ETC. If the ETH is successful in POS, ETC can change and follow the POS system. It is a win-win scenario of ETC.
4. ETC has a vibrant support from the community and its core developer. It is run by community and not by only one person.

A lot of trading is a self fulfilling prophecy - In short the more you know, the more likely you are to follow the big guys, ‘whales’ in crypto terms. From there you can trade with or against them.

I’m writing up a short explanation of Fibonacci Levels and how they ‘work’ in trading.

Firstly the Fibonacci is created using two points of extreme, either a low to high, or low to high in a recent up or down trend.

It was created by Leonardo Fibonacci and basically uses maths to figure out ratios between those extremes and potential retracements.

The key points are 61.8% known as the Golden Ratio and 38.2% is also a common place of retracement (as show in the picture).

In summary, traders will often use these ratios to assist in trades. The more people that do it, the more successful it’ll be... and hence the self fulfilling prophecy.

&amp;nbsp;

Edit for update in market -
After approximately 5 hours it then dropped down again, now when you look at the chart - guess where it stopped this time - at the 50%, it's amazing how much these levels are respected.

How could you predict this...? You can't always but a big warning sign is when one of the 4hr candles closes below the 38.2% fib mark (as shown [ETC/BTC Chart](https://i.imgur.com/7fHvyaO.png)) When a candle finishes (4hrs is up) its not about what has happened in that time (might have gone below the 38.2% multiple times) its about where the candle closes.

&amp;nbsp;

Edit for update in market -
Crypto sentiment is at a low with CMC being the lowest since NOV.
If the market closes below the 50% ratio, you could see it go down to the 61.8% [BTC/ETC Chart](https://i.imgur.com/ICu4ll2.png)

Currently since approx. 1:30am EST we have seen a very very minor bounce back and it seems to be holding for now at $16 key words (for now) as long as the HODL stays strong! If more people fold $14 and below are not far away.

Possible to expect another small to mid size jump in either direction when full trading goes live on CB Pro as they have outlined in their blog post as ""Stage 4"". Currently they are still in the transfer (import) only stage 1 which should be complete within 24hrs. After that is stage 2 ""post only"" then stage 3 is ""limit only"" possibly too see some jumps here as well since trades will be happening but market orders are not live until stage 4.

Personally I didn't expect more then a spike to $20 so I got out at a good time but I also didn't expect this significant of a drop arterwards... The ETF decision being delayed also didn't help the overall market. BTC kind of dragged ETC down during the dump and made it look worse then it really was IMO.

# The Stages of the Ethereum Classic Launch    
There will be four stages to the launch as outlined below. We will follow each of these stages independently for each new order book: ETC–USD, ETC–BTC and ETC–EUR. If at any point one of the new order books does not meet our assessment for a healthy and orderly market, we may keep the book in one state for a longer period of time, or suspend trading as per our Trading Rules.

**Transfer-only.** Customers will be able to transfer Ethereum Classic beginning at 10am PT on Tuesday August 7th. Traders cannot place orders and no orders will be filled on these order books. Order books will be in transfer-only mode for *24–48 hours.*

**Post-only.** In the second stage, customers can post limit orders but there will be no matches (completed orders). Order books will be in post-only mode for a minimum of 10 minutes.


**Limit-only.** In the third stage, limit orders will start matching but customers are unable to submit market orders. Order books will be in limit-only mode for a minimum of 10 minutes.

**Full trading.** In the final stage, full trading services will be available, including limit, market, and stop orders.

First coinbase plans to allow deposits first for Coinbase Prime clients and Coinbase Pro clients. Coinbase Prime clients are Coinbase's professional trading platform for institutional clientsAccess the same diversified liquidity pool underpinning all Coinbase products through a professional trading platform designed for institutional clients.

  **Institutional Investor**  


What is an institution?Your firm's core business is investing or trading, using your firm's own capital, or on behalf of your clients. Examples: hedge fund, asset manager, proprietary trading firm, venture capital firm, bank, or brokerage firm.

**Corporate Client**

What is a corporate client?Your firm's core business activity is not related to investing or trading. Examples: professional services firm, software provider or ISV, money services business, merchant, non-profit, or digital currency mining firm.

* Coinbase intend to allow 24–48 hours of inbound transfers through [**Coinbase Pro**](https://pro.coinbase.com/) **and** [**Coinbase Prime**](https://prime.coinbase.com/) **before enabling trading.**

[Coinbase Markets](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-institutional-deea317d23af) — the Markets team is planning to add trading support for ETC. We intend to allow 24–48 hours of transfers through Pro/Prime before opening the markets. In accordance with our [Trading Rules](https://www.coinbase.com/legal/trading_rules), all ETC books will open in post-only for a minimum of 10 mins. Once sufficient liquidity is established, trading will then be enabled on Pro and Prime.

So what im getting from this is Coinbase learn from past mistake by adding bitcoin cash and now places restrictions before flooding the market. Plus all Coinbase Prime clients and Pro will get customers who previously had an Ethereum Classic balance on the platform as a result of the 2016 Ethereum hard fork **and** did not elect to withdraw their funds prior to January 2017 will receive a corresponding **Ethereum Classic credit.**  

Logical to assume these specific clients are going to want top premium dollar for holdings and credits.  When the average person logs onto coinbase and see a price point at $18+ (not even knowing the science behind ETC with total supply at 100,000,000) and they see other listed crypto bitcoin $7,000+  ETH 400+ LTC $75+ Bitcoin cash $500+ that alone would trigger a FOMO buy in.  But price will increase before then since the roll out to being adding to coinbase will have steps in I for once to jump ahead of the line and jumping into ETC today 8/6/2018 before the process starts tomorrow 8/7/2018.

Soon Bitcoin will go on a run and pass the ath of 20k

People will hear about it in the news again and fomo in and start to buy buy buy.

They will join coinbase the only real fiat/crypto exhange they have just opened up faster deposits and deposit availability in more countries they are primed for business and know that a bull run is just around the corner.

People on coinbase will buy the cheapest crypto on there becuase it's human nature to want to own round numbers or at least 1 of something so they will be buying up lots and lots of ETC which will make the price rocket! This is why the litecoin price surged last year more than Bitcoins or Ethereum.

Ltc went from $3.71 to $366.19 ATH almost a 100x

You can now purchase a 140 character string and image to be shown on the [P3C.io](https://P3C.io) (200+ users) homepage. The ad is stored on the blockchain, immutable and censorship resistant!

**But there is a catch**. When you buy an ad a timer starts, and for the first 24 hours the ad can be snatched from you for 5x the price you paid:  50% is given to you, and then 50% is given to the P3C community as dividends. For the 24 hours after that, it's 3 times the price (with 50/50 split), then 2x, then back to the base line price of .1 ETC. The ad also shows up in our Discord chat via a bot!  


Give it a shot and sponsor our community! We're looking for input.

Buy a sponsorship (requires Saturn Wallet) - [https://p3c.io/sponsor.html](http://p3c.io/sponsor.html)

See it on P3C (requires Saturn Wallet) - [https://p3c.io/interact.html](https://p3c.io/interact.html)

I know this is probably a noob question but as of today I have been trying to set up a paper wallet for ETC and after a few hours of researching most people were saying just go to the official [myetherwallet.com](https://myetherwallet.com) and change the node to ETC ([epool.io](https://epool.io)) however I  keep getting the following error: (error\_33) Could not connect to the node. Refresh your page, try a different node (top-right corner), check your firewall settings. If custom node, check your config. There doesn't seem to be a clear explanation on how to resolve this and I'm not sure what this means. If anyone can help me this I'd appreciate it greatly.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, the answers I found all of the place relating to whether you can store ETC in a ETH wallet seem conflicting. Some people are saying you can store ETH in an ETC wallet while others are saying you cant. However I have tested this and it appears you can since my ETH wallet has a balance. So if I could have a concise explanation on this too I'd be grateful. Thank you.

I’m working on a new exchange and trading game. I’m basing it all on Ethereum Classic as the default quote currency. The goal is to turn it not only into a cool exchange but a really nice trading experience/game.

I’m looking for a team to help testing, find bugs, provide some volume (only tiny amounts while sorting out bugs), maybe even somebody who wants to do some angel investment (in return i add your logo and link for all eternity on the landing page).

The project name is Shitcoin World

please try it out [https://shitcoinworld.com](https://shitcoinworld.com/)

1. Visit [dappdirect.net](https://dappdirect.net ""dappdirect.net"") and make sure you have [Saturn Wallet](https://saturn.network/saturn-wallet ""Saturn Wallet"") (an ETC wallet) installed, you don't need ETC in it. Disable Metamask if you have that installed.
2. Donate at the bottom using Money Button and Bitcoin.
3. If Saturn Wallet is running, you will be notified that we received your donation and are sending you a token in return. The token will arrive in around 15 minutes. 

**What's going on behind the scenes?** Whenever the money button is used, the TxId and your in-browser ETC address is sent to our server. Our server then checks the transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain, and if it is valid, it will send you a comparable amount of token. This token, P3C, is completely redeemable for real ETC on [our website](https://p3c.io/interact.html ""our website""), or you can choose to hold it and earn dividends. Every time P3C is bought, sold, or transferred on the network, 10% goes to all token holders.

**Why are we doing this?** We believe Bitcoin is the ultimate medium of exchange, however if we can add a rewards points system on top of it, which is what we're trying to do on [P3C.io](https://P3C.io ""P3C.io""), consumers will demand Bitcoin payments. Right now many people use credit cards because it gives them rewards. We want to do the same in a decentralized manner.

No, really... where are you now? I'd like to hear a follow up from you please.

If you were one of those people who said that Ethereum Classic will be trading at $100+ after Coinbase adds it, please come here and explain your reasoning for making such claims, while remembering to let us know how you feel *now* about being entirely wrong with your prediction(s).

With the Ethash ASICs and the reduction in block rewards, GPU miners are leaving Ethereum. Having Ethereum completely controlled by ASICs may cause some big problems for ETH when they eventually try to go to POS.  A move now by ETC could  secure all/most of the GPU miners which bolster's the claim that ETC is truly decentralized and loyal to its foundations. It would seem this could be a great strategic move by ETC to out maneuver ETH in the long run.

Anyway, just my thoughts. I'd like to hear some more discussion on this. Thanks!",NA,"9h76wv",NA,0,NA,"false",1540146162,"false","self","t5_3fgtx",NA,"","","false","true",NA,"/r/EthereumClassic/comments/9h76wv/why_not_progpow_for_etc/",NA,"","false","","",0,0
