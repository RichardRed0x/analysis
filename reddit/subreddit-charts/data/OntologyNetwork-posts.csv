**Ontology Network**  

&amp;nbsp;

**How would the reputation system for tackling misinformation work on a blockchain?**  

The reputation system is just one method of evaluation, we need multiple standards to create a complete system for addressing the problem of misinformation. Ontology will in the future have different rating systems using different information to evaluate different entities. All information to support the rating systems should be recorded with proof of evidence from relevant sources, which should then be verified (or refuted) by others, provided with relevant evidence.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Do you foresee a future where the Ontology replaces the use of passports?**  

Since Ontology will be a connector for different verification systems, including government passport systems, it’s technically possible. Ontology can be used as an integrator for different e-ID systems, so can actually build more elaborate identity profiles that a passport alone.  

&amp;nbsp;

**What are the exact functions of the Ontology tokens? Is ONT a utility token or it is an asset that produces reward (for example with NEO where it gives GAS)?**  

Because business scenarios on Ontology are expandable, Ontology token use is not confined. However, in the initial phase the ONT token can be used as a service fee for different business scenarios. In the current design Ontology will have two tokens; one is for governance and the other functions similarly to NEO’s GAS. The governance token will be used in Ontology governance decision making and the GAS-like token will be used for service fees, including running business scenarios/smart contracts on Ontology. Ontology smart contracts will mostly focus on business process control, other token clearing/settlement will be done by other systems such as NEO. As more business scenarios run on Ontology we will be able to find more ways to use the ONT tokens.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Can you give a practical application use of Ontology?**  

When doctors, hospitals, and patients register their identities onto the blockchain, the blockchain fills in the trust gap between the pharmacy and patient with the records of the medicine's key information and proof of authenticity. The pharmaceutical enterprise then sells the prescribed medicine to the patient after verification of the doctor and hospital's credentials. You can find a graphic which illustrates this on page 19 of the introductory white paper.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Will Ontology have its own complete chain or will it fork from NEO or another chain?**  

Ontology is a network for chains using protocols and APIs. Ontology has its own public core ledger (not forked) that acts as a connector/mapping list for identity, data, and other information.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Ontology &amp; NEO**  

&amp;nbsp;

**In the white paper it says “Ontology has infrastructure platforms to support dApp development for different scenarios”. In the case of supply chain for example, why would the dApp not be made on NEO?**  

There are three major reasons why Ontology needs to have its own blockchain/s and not live on NEO as a smart contract. The first reason is due to the nature of Ontology’s business scope – identity and data. It’s too big a leap of faith for business, financial institutions, and governments to use NEO (or Bitcoin, Ethereum) to store sensitive identity information, let alone to be compliant with laws and regulations designed for pre-blockchain world.  
 
The second reason is that identity services generally require high throughout and low latency. It is not economical and scalable to use NEO as an identity service for each and every scenario. This is also why Ontology is designed as a network of blockchains, not one single blockchain. The multiple interoperable blockchain network design makes Ontology highly scalable and each blockchain can adopt independent governance model to be compliant in its own jurisdiction.  
 
Ontology works as an index of identity and data. Applications can choose to run business logic smart contract on Ontology or NEO. Some applications may not be built as a smart contract but as a traditional IT system by simply accessing Ontology’s business-oriented APIs. That’s the third reason why Ontology needs an independent network.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Can you explain how NEO contracts will be used in Ontology? What value does Ontology bring to NEO investors?**  

NEO focuses on digital asset services with smart contracts, including token usage linked to business scenarios. Also, when businesses that run on Ontology need to perform a token sale, NEO can provide the token system.  

Ontology can also be the link between NEO and non-token based business scenarios. For example, if the bank needs digital asset services, Ontology can be the connector between NEO and banks (or other businesses).  

&amp;nbsp;

**Will the Ontology tokens be built on top of the NEO blockchain? Will the NEO or GAS token in any way be used for interacting with Ontology? Will the presale/token distribution be on NEO blockchain using NEO token?**  

Ontology token sale distribution will accept NEO tokens, however the Ontology token mechanism has not yet been confirmed. NEO and GAS can be used on Ontology for different business scenarios.  

&amp;nbsp;

**What’s the difference between “digital identity” and “trust identity”?**  

Ontology’s “trust identity” is a connector/mapping list for “digital identity” services, including NEO ID, which can help NEO ID link to more business scenarios.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Does Ontology have an exclusive contract with NEO regulating the partnership and responsibilities? Is there a roadmap of what Ontology and NEO aim to accomplish through their partnership?**  

NEO will be the primary digital assets service provider for clearing and settlement on Ontology. There is no contract between Ontology and NEO now, though Ontology and NEO already have an established partnership. One thing on the roadmap is that in the future business scenarios on Ontology want to hold ICOs they will be able to on NEO.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Can we expect NEX, Ontology, and ProjectICO to work together to make a trusted exchange with digital identity and the ability to run an ICO directly on the exchange?**  

In a technical sense that is possible! We hope to make many exciting collaborations through Ontology.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Can you provide one case where NEO, GAS, Ontology, DNA, THEKEY, and NEO ID interact together? There needs to be a strong vertical integration between them to justify the Ontology architecture.**  

NEO ID/THEKEY can be ID service providers on Ontology, and NEO/GAS can be used for clearing/settlement scenarios – in some cases ID verification will be a requirement for execution of a smart contract. DNA, however, is just a framework, not a platform. ONT’s ledger is an enhanced version based on DNA.  

&amp;nbsp;

**ONTOLOGY &amp; OTHER SERVICES**  

&amp;nbsp;

**How does Ontology relate to THEKEY? Are they direct competition?**  

Ontology is a connector/mapping list for identity services. THEKEY can be one of the identity service providers to Ontology. So in that sense they are mutually beneficial, not direct competition!  

&amp;nbsp;

**Does Ontology have plans to have an API-compatible layer/web3 integration into the network?**  

Ontology will provide multiple protocols/API interfaces, including web3, in the future.  

&amp;nbsp;

**COMPLIANCE**

&amp;nbsp;

**Will Ontology be compliant to regulations in China? How can Ontology assure investors of the risk in the crypto/blockchain space in China?**  

Yes. Business scenarios run on Ontology will be legally compliant in both China and other regions. We use a chain network model to support this; different chains can follow different governance models and follow different rules and regulations.  

Ontology will be an open community project and token sales will not be open for individuals in Mainland China, though they will be free to build business scenarios on Ontology.  

&amp;nbsp;

**OTHER**  

&amp;nbsp;

***“Regarding Fosun, they have invested solely in Onchain. Onchain is for-profit and NEO non-profit. Fosun logically wants to see return on its investment, so it is in their interest to have Onchain make revenue and profits, potentially by shifting Da Hongfei's time and focus, as well as shared knowledge and resources to Onchain rather than NEO, while having the decision-making power through the equity they own to actually act upon these interests. They have not much interest in success of NEO as far as I'm aware. NEO shareholders on the other hand don't have any decision power or legal claim on profits, so we are fundamentally subordinated to Fosun. Am I right to assume this is a first example of Fosun/Onchain executing their decision power and claiming a part of the ecosystem to benefit Onchain rather than NEO? Doesn't this imply a clear conflict of interest between Fosun/Onchain and NEO with Da Hongfei in the middle?“***

Fosun is a strategical investor. Although Onchain/Foson have no direct interests in NEO, Onchain shareholders are clearly aware that Onchain will not succeed without NEO's success. The mission of Onchain is never to take NEO's market share but to foster the ecosystem and benefit in return. NEO is a permissionless open network. Enterprises, financial institutions, and government agencies always hesitate to connect to open networks due to secrecy, privacy, and regulatory concerns. Onchain and Ontology can act as a buffer, connecting mainstream business and NEO network.",NA,"7f8fdo",NA,0,NA,"false",1512301189,"false","self","t5_4blrv","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/OntologyNetwork/comments/7f8fdo/answers_to_ontology_networks_first_ama/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

After perusing Reddit for much time, it has only been recently that I've have started actively contributing. The Ontology ICO has raised many questions for NEO holders (such as myself) and I felt compelled to air them and encourage debate (even if it has involved a bit of attack back and FUD calls).

Thank you to all that have shared their insights and resources. I can now see that Ontology may well offer something valuable to NEO and, managed the right way, the value of the NEO/ONT ecosystem to society could be significant.

In saying that, there is still a lack of quality arguments as to why ONT could not render NEO redundant. I'm not saying this will necessarily happen, but it surely a risk. 

Notwithstanding whether this is a real or perceived risk, my idea for a solution is based on others' suggestions that they will invest in ONT as a hedge against NEO. I personally think this is a good idea and believe there is an opportunity for a win-win for NEO holders, Onchain and Ontology.

The solution:

- Ontology launches a presale where existing NEO holders have a right to invest proportionately to the existing NEO held on their address so as to allow existing NEO holders the oppprtunity to acquire the same % ownership across both chains (can the NEO smart contracts facilitate this? If not, this is hopefully still possible through a more manual process)


Benefits to Onchain/ONT/NEO

- greater level of trust and transparency from the community leading to greater longer term value outcomes. 

- ONT still achieves the same fund raising outcomes (wouldnt say no to an air drop but let's be pragmatic, Ontology needs funds to achieve its objectives and additional dilution isn't a great solution)

- allocation of ONT coins to a coin holder demographic that is less likely to pump and dump the ONT ICO, and more likely to hold longer term as believers in the ecosystem (they could even take a backdated snapshot of the NEO blockchain to ensure people don't game the system through acquiring NEO only for purposes of accessing early ONT tokens, although the market cap/price of NEO naturally places limits on this in any case)

This type of rights issue/first right of refusal is not an overly innovative concept. It generally exists in most corporate constitutions but is often also utilised as a solution for principals/sponsors (such as Onchain) to manage potential conflicts and tricky situations involving fiduciary duties and reputation. (As an interesting aside, I am investor in a business where the founder is about to launch a token sale he says will be complementary to that business. He is still [his own idea] airdropping tokens to shareholders, and offering a significant discount for additional tokens acquired, notwithstanding it is far clearer than this situation that our existing investment in this business will benefit from the token sale)

Any additional thoughts/comments/ideas very welcome. If you believe this represents a fair solution to the current debate for all stakeholders then I encourage you to upvote to ensure this post gains visibility to the relevant decision makers. 

I dont believe any firm decisions around ONT token sales and distribution have been made yet so this is an opportunity for the NEO community to help shape this process for an ICO we are facilitating on our blockchain.

Thanks for reading. Go NEO!

Over 200 attendees from within the fintech scene and beyond came together at 28 Liberty Street, iconically situated next to Wall Street, a center for traditional financial systems.

&amp;nbsp;

Li Jun, Chief Architect of Onchain, headed the event by introducing Ontology Network. He discussed how the ecosystem addresses current issues in trust networks, as well as how its components work together to build a trust system fit for all industries. Applying the framework to different business scenarios, Li described how adoption of NEO’s smart contract system will strengthen the two projects, building a system accessible for conventional businesses. He also anticipated future Ontology white papers, which will be released in the coming months and continue to further explain the infrastructure of the project.

&amp;nbsp;

The Q&amp;A session for Li’s speech cleared some questions surrounding Ontology Network. Li explained the ecosystem supports multiple blockchains and can act as an index for where data is stored. Li also emphasized the government support for blockchain development in China, and pointed to Onchain’s existing collaboration with Chinese local government to track and manage identity information.

&amp;nbsp;

Da Hongfei, CEO of Onchain and Founder of NEO, began his speech by sharing NEO’s timeline and introducing existing and upcoming projects, including a development competition early next year. He further explained NEO’s status as a compliant smart economy and its nature as a community-driven and -funded NPO that supports collaboration with external developers and academic institutions.

&amp;nbsp;

Talking about Ontology Network, Da explained how it will work with multiple systems to provide a solution for ordinary businesses to run on blockchain. Its open infrastructure for distributed trust allows users to compile, control, and authorize use of their identity information and other data, turning ordinary data into tradable data assets. Da further explained how NEO can be used in Ontology Network to issue tokens and trade them with NEX.

&amp;nbsp;

After a coffee break AlphaCat ([https://www.alphacat.io](https://www.alphacat.io)), THEKEY ([https://www.thekey.vip/](https://www.thekey.vip/)), QLink ([https://qlink.mobi/f/qlink](https://qlink.mobi/f/qlink)), Deep Brain ([http://www.deepbrain.ai/](http://www.deepbrain.ai/)), and PeerAtlas ([http://www.peeratlas.com](http://www.peeratlas.com)), all part of the NEO ecosystem, presented their projects to the community, followed by a networking session.

&amp;nbsp;

In the evening Ontology Network held a join meetup with NEO, which brought together the China and US blockchain communities to share knowledge and ideas, answer further questions, and discuss the future development of decentralized projects between the two regions.

&amp;nbsp;

We look forward to meeting more individuals across the globe interested in becoming a part of our ecosystem. In the meantime, you can keep up to date with us through our social media channels. Thank you New York, until next time!

&amp;nbsp;

In October 2016, together with Chinese key enterprises, the CESI (China Electronics Standardization Institute) founded the CBD-Forum (China Blockchain Technology and Industrial Development Forum). While endeavoring in blockchain technology and application development, CBD-Forum initiated an open-source community, DAppLedger (Distributed Application Ledger). Based on the fundamental platform autonomously developed by community members, DAppLedger is building a multi-platform operation model, seeking the best structure during application integration. DAppLedger will draft a series of open blockchain standards, as to realize the modularization of the blockchain system, which is inter-operative and pluggable. In this way, DAppLedger can drive the development of blockchain core technologies and support blockchain startups and innovations.

&amp;nbsp;

Ontology Zero just joined MIIT DAppLedger for further development. Ontology Zero derived from DNA (Distributed Network Architecture) and is the first spontaneous, original and open-source blockchain infrastructure in China. In May 2017, Ontology Zero was recognized by MIIT as the one of the first standard authentication blockchain framework. Ontology Zero takes key blockchain systems around the globe (HyperLedger, Ethereum, Tendermint) as references and integrates multiple innovation technologies, thus to create a new blockchain network structure, which is high-performance and configurable, in order to realize data-exchange and value-exchange among blockchains of all types.

&amp;nbsp;

Ontology Zero is an open-source, autonomous, controllable, configurable distributed ledger technical framework for enterprises built on Ontology Network. It openly connects blockchain fundamental technical solutions of all types and standardizes industrial solutions to provide DAAS (DApp As a Service). With years of practice, Ontology Zero can be applied to Supply Chain, trade finance, equity registration and transfer, settlement of transactions, IoT, medical manufacturing, industrial manufacturing, credit investigation etc., and already has fully-developed application scenarios in digital identity, contract vouching, source tracking, etc. 

&amp;nbsp;

Ontology Zero joined the incubator project initiated by Wanda Internet Technology Group, Onchain and Fosun Financial, with less than 5% overlapping with the project codes of open-source projects overseas. With its top-ranking autonomous controllability, more than 50 community members have devoted 700+ times of code contribution for Ontology Zero. Project founding members have applied for almost 20 patents for domestic and international blockchain fundamental and application inventions.

&amp;nbsp;

According to the official of Ontology Zero, in conjunction with joining the open-source community of MIIT DAppLedger, Ontology Zero will integrate domestic and international community power via Hackathons, meetups, internship and training programs, and further drive the development of blockchain fundamental platform technologies with other DAppLedger members, in order to optimize blockchain ecosystems and better serve blockchain technology development and blockchain application popularization.

Those who successfully subscribed have already been contacted by newsletter@email.ont.io.


* There is no news as to when and where ONT will be listed on an exchange.

* You cannot buy ONT anywhere.  No one has ONT, so beware of anyone saying that they do.   There is no whitelist to sign up for.  

* They will send out instructions on how to fill out the 'KYC' through their newsletter, Telegram, Slack, WeChat, or QQ group.


* Ontology will not have an ICO.


* The only website for Ontology is https://ont.io


* See side menu for more Ontology info. 


**Updates:**


* The KYC FAQ for people who were rewarded ONT by subscribing the newsletter be read here:

So I started researching this, but the more I read, the more questions I have.

1. ONT allows different private databases to connect to each other, right?

2. It provides the platform (so a blockchain) and tools to implement it into various blockchains and centralized databases, right?

3. It will be able to connect different blockchains. So what is NeoX, which supposedly allows interconnection between NEO and ONT? Isn't it redundant? Or every blockchain need a separate product to be able to communicate with the ONT network?

4. In what sense is it decentralized? How can you decentralize for example medical data? Will the data be stored on the ONT blockchain, with an encryption where only the relevant parties hold the decryption key? Who and how controls access? Who decides which data is trustworthy? For example what stops me from creating fake university degrees? There must be some central authority that decides what data to trustworthy, isn't it (kinda like SSL certificate issuers on the web)?

5. How will a product look like that is built on the ONT blockchain? For example you want to allow access to your real address to a shop. Will you send a transaction from your ONT ""wallet"" with a decryption key to this data? How will you manage your data from different sources? How can you be identified without a central authority that vouches for your identitiy?

Many may know OnChain as the company that was founded by DaHongFei and Erik Zhang, the founders of NEO.

OnChain was developed as a collaboration between Chinese businesses and government. This was a wise move as it would allow the developers to work on a product while actively receiving advice from those who craft the laws. Hence, there is no chance of regulatory resistance to the products released by OnChain.

“First, I need to clarify that NEO and Onchain are separate entities, so Onchain doesn’t own NEO, or NEO, Onchain. They are separately funded – NEO is funded by the community, and Onchain is funded by a very famous financial group in China, Fosun. They bought a lot of insurance companies and banks in Europe. So they are separate. Second, Onchain benefits from the NEO ecosystem. The product, called DNA, is very similar to NEO, but it is written in the Go language. OnChain is helping other blockchains and financial institutions to build their blockchains with DNA. It’s basically very similar to NEO, and in the future, with NEOx (the cross-chain protocol) everything can be linked together.” – Hongfei

Ontology will also work together with NEO to bridge the gap between blockchain technology and the real world. While NEO and Ontology have similar goals, NEO focuses on digital assets and a global Smart Economy whereas Ontology focuses on trust, identity, and data exchange and authorization. Think of NEO and Ontology like peanut butter and jelly. They are mutually beneficial and put together, they make a tasty sandwich.

http://identity.foundation/

The first Chinese project in the Decentralized Identity Foundation which includes Microsoft, IBM, and IOTA is also an active partner of the Ontology project.

ONG is the Ontology equivalent of NEO’s GAS, and is the utility token of the network. ONG will be used for token transactions, network storage, deployment and execution of smart contracts, and use of other network resources. Like NeoGas, ONG will be generated over a period of 22 years, with 16% being generated in the first year, 52% within the first four years, and 80% within the first 12 years. A total of 1,000,000,000 (one billion) ONG tokens will be generated. ONG spent on the network will be redistributed to ONT holders.","","855jaa",NA,0,NA,"false",1522317327,"false","self","t5_4blrv","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/OntologyNetwork/comments/855jaa/the_ontology_network_and_a_smart_economy/","","",NA,"","",0,0

Ontology is publicly going to do what Onchain was privately doing. However, they figured out while building only private blockchains, that the centralized way would be better. They are building a hybrid both decentralized for fixed data (among other reasons) and centralized network protocol for compliance (among other reasons) that will be linking the real-world to the digital blockchain world. Their white paper will be endlessly changing. Which could mean that your token will be endlessly appreciating in value over time as they expand and adapt and expand. They will have many blockchain in their network. They are building the architectural protocol for that real-world link to take place whereby current companies like Facebook &amp; Amazon will have a template to simply plugin. They will have their own open source ecosystem to build on top of. If these real world institutions want to create digital assets they can do that with ONT by using the NEO virtual machine integrated into the system which then In return will be able to communicate throughout the smart economy using NEOX cross chain protocol. But it doesn't end there. Ontology network of trust will also be cross network compatible with ETH, EOS, ADA, ICX and so forth. Now, I do not know how far along they are in this process, but I do know that Onchain is obviously famous in China, and we all already know what they did with NEO on a global level.  By understanding the scale of this project, the interoperability with other platforms, the global link between the real-world and existing internet companies and legal systems, and the complex technical protocol infrastructure, we can draw a visionary conclusion that Ontology might take a position in the top 3 cryptographic assets this year depending upon progress.

Super disappointing. More evidence (in addition to the [Medium article](https://medium.com/@sylvainartplayribes/chasing-fake-volume-a-crypto-plague-ea1a3c1e0b5e)) of their dishonest business practices.

I understand that ONT went with a different start-up strategy than most (no ICO, but give-aways and promos instead) but it seems to have backfired in the case of the partnership with Huobi, a dishonest exchange, as this will garner frustration rather than fans of the product.

i got a simple question, i hope you can answer it.

i found ontology to late, and just cause of the high volume during the last days. reading about it, i found out that it had no ICO, but gave away 1k tokens to everyone that registered for the newsletter.

this sounded totally ""strange"" to me, because at the current prices, this would mean they gave away 1,5k (or more) USD to everyone for doing nothing.


i know that many new tokens offer free airdrops, but normally in small values (like 5-10 usd) and u have to follow twitter, follow telegram and so on.

why did ontology give away such high sums for free? 

is anyone able to explain? this is just a question out of interest.

I was looking through the Ontology subreddit and notice there are a TON of people wondering why the price of ONT has been ""pumping so much"". While I cannot give a clear answer why it's increasing in price, these are some observations I have had about Ontology and the related projects after reading quite a bit of the WP's and some deep research over the last few months about a few of the related projects. 

PLEASE add your insights to this thread if you have anything to add - who is working with any of the named projects in here, team members, etc. 

Let's get this community engaged! :)

Here are some potential reasons that I have also shared in other Ontology threads in this Subreddit because there are so many asking about why the price increase. I'm not entirely sure either, but these are some observations I have about the project and related projects that might help us all out - please add your insights to this thread:

""Holding ONT generates ONG like holding NEO generates GAS.

That's the real reason everybody wants ONT, along with the fact that this is being built into NEO which will serve as sort of an incubation/crowdfunding piece to the entire multi-chain ecosystem. You can find many other clues by researching into the project and reading one of their various white papers.

I've read them and this is exactly what is needed for corporations to onboard.

*RedPulse* = Chinese Bloomberg. *Trinity Network* = off-chain scalibility. *NeonExchange* = Neo Decentralized Exchange (DEX). *DeepBrain Chain* = AI data chain. *ELASTOS* = digital asset/smart contract exchange (I think, not entirely sure). *High Performance Blockchain (HPB)* = hardware/software payment processing which, in their WP, state they are working with *China UnionPay* who is bigger than Visa and Mastercard, I think combined now. *Onchain's DNA* = the back-end to corporate infrastructure integration with a multi-chain interoperability  infrastructure for companies (yes, real companies), allowing for easy/flexible management of which chains are interconnected, how, permissions, data, etc. Onchain is also the company behind NEO and Ontology.

Hopefully this is at least enough for some readers to begin tying the clues together. I'm a big fan of all of these projects and have been researching deeply/reading white papers.

Enjoy. :)

Edit: TL;DR = people are discovering/adopting Ontology and, I think, that it's resemblance and relation to Neo's dual-token structure is something people enjoy. Specially because it's still a low price coin considering it will generate ONG like NEO generates GAS.
Just my 2 cents, DYOR all the time; but this should at least help bridge the gap between your own research along the way.","","87o5h1",NA,0,NA,"false",1522367680,"false","self","t5_4blrv","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/OntologyNetwork/comments/87o5h1/some_insights_into_ontology_project_help_you/","","",NA,"","",0,0

I’m trying to set some number straight

I have read how the supply of tokens is distributed among the stakeholders but that may provide insights on eventual supply that is unlocked, not actually circulating. 

1)
So far my understanding is that the sources of market liquidity have been
A) 500 giveaway to for the participants of devcon
B) the mailing list giveaway
C) the NEO airdrop
Is there a way to estimate how much this adds up to in terms of circulating number of token?

2)
In a few days the incoming giveaways of HUBOI and BINANCE ammounting to 8250000 (if i’m not wrong). Will add to the current circulating supply. Do these fall in the community portion (12%)? Or are these part of the institutional partners portionf (28%)? If we add this to the first bit, how much do we reach in total # of tokens?

3)
Successively there will be other community giveaways. Answering the first two questions allow to then deduce how much is actually left in actual number of tokens for this bucket.

1) and 2) will give us the short term supply. 3) will give us a portion of the medium term supply. 
4) What are the remaining components of the more medium term supply? In other words, what other type of distributions can we expect in the next 6-12 months? 
5) What are the remaining components of the longer term supply? (Other distributions that should happen after the next 12 months)

 out on Binance March 8, 2018. For every NEO holder got free .01 Ontology coins ONT which they released there

 coins prices bought and sold as high as $8.32 in the first day that’s a lot of free coins and money they gave to the

and trust,Identity, Data, Dapps, where these 2 projects are platforms run by the community of coin holders. And in time 
 will decide how much GAS is required to have to pay from Developers all over the world to add there coins on there 

platforms as of now NEO has 36 ICO/COINS on there platform with many many many more to come and while yes

 Ethereum has thousands of coins on there platform we can honestly say a lot of those are coins that will not exists in

 a couple of years and many many scams, pumps and dumps, and projects that never really take off for a variety of

 reason) plus in order to write code on there platform you will need to learn a whole new computer language where

 as with NEO you can use C++ and JAVA and many others and many more to come. Although I believe it cost 2,500

 GAS to build on NEO which is very expensive but brings the real projects with real visions and teams and experience.

 (Who would want to pay that much for a pump and dump or scam just a thought) e existence is 100,00,000 NEO

 and only Circulating supply of $65,000,000. just 1 year again March 24, 2017 NEO was trading at 16 CENT!!!!! It’s

 all time high in price was $190 briefly. As of today NEO is worth $68.73 so if you invested $1,000 1 year ago you

 would have $429,000 TODAY!!! Wonder what more money and more coins would be in a year from now or 2,3,4,5

 and beyond years ����!!! This is why I put all my money on Ontology because if we missed the ride on NEO then

ONTOLOGY is our next space ride to the moon!!! (BTW we still haven’t missed the ride with NEO)
 
                       Ontology did not have a ICO because they sold out to private investors in which these investors

  bought in at $5. Ontology came out  on Binance March 8, 2018. For every NEO holder got free .01 Ontology coins

 ONT which they released there coins prices bought and sold as high as $8.32 in the first day that’s a lot of free coins

 and money they gave to the community of NEO Holders and it is still trading high at $1.45 (we’ll actually very very

 low to its TRUE VALUE!!! NEO And ONTology are together as partners that will create on blockchain technology a

 smart ecosystem and trust, Identity, Data, Dapps, where these 2 projects are platforms run by the community of

 coin holders. And in time we  will decide how much GAS is required to have to pay from Developers all over the

 come. Although I believe it cost 2,500 GAS to build on NEO which is very expensive but brings the real projects with

 real visions and teams and experience. (Who would want to pay that much for a pump and dump or scam just a

 thought) Also every NEO NeP-5 token that is on the Platform has strict restrictions to participate in there ICO with

 KYC “Know Your Customer” where they need to verify your identity very securely to prevent frauds and 100%

 secures your Digital assets you own. 

                             In Ethereum where there will be coins running on there platforms but that’s where the similarities 

end. First NEO is a non-profit community-based blockchain project.  NEO is capable of 10,000 transactions per

 second versus Ethereum which is capable of 15 transactions per second. Ethereum uses Proof of Work so computers

 are mining the coins showing proof of work where in NEO it is Proof of Stake (Just holding NEO Generates GAS a

 duel coin they provide which is used to pay to run Dapps on there platform and used for very small transaction fees

 plus you are able to purchase any of there ICO with NEO coins or GAS. As of today GAS is valued at $22.09 with a

 max supply of 100million and will run out in 22years. Meaning no more GAS EVER created. GAS all time high price in

 January 2018 was around $79.76!!! The beauty of this system is with the more holdings of NEO coins it generates

 you GAS that you are able to collect every 5 minutes. Then with GAS you can use it on the open market buy and sell

 crypto and even better buy more NEO to generate even more GAS until it all runs out. It built like this so you don’t

 have to sell out of your position on NEO for purchases. For example and this is coming from NEO Founder and I am

 paraphrasing “So imagine you own Apple stocks and you want to buy a iphone then in order to buy the product you

 need to sell out of your shares with Apple those losing value in your investment. where in NEO being a coin holder

 you are not required to sell out and will be generating GAS and by the way GAS is #64 coin on coinmarketcap is a

 market cap share of $220+million!! NEO is also Quantum computer proof and where in the future once’s Quantum

 Computer are being used other coins and platforms will have serious issues, the first and only coin of its kind that is

 Quantum proof. NEO is also unforkable meaning there can’t be another coin to take over NEO community or a

 another coin created from NEO. NEO is also hosting their 1st NEO Dev Competition where they are the host and

 Microsoft yes bill gates Microsoft is the Co-organizer In a completion will the great developers of the world compete

 for there ideas and projects powered by blockchain technology NEO and ONTology!!! We have here developers

 writing white papers presenting code and ideas of building a smart economy. Get this the judge panel are Da Hongfei

 NEO Founder as well as Erik Zhang NEO Founder &amp; Core Developer, next we have Jun Li who came from Onchain and 

ONT Founder.
                        Onchain is a separate company with Chinese government support  and CEO of Onchain is Da Hongfei

 that same Da who is NEO Founder. So Jun Li ONT Founder came from Onchain and with him over 60 engineers and

 many other  well established professionals on a massive team with 5 white papers out and more to come. They are

 part of same Team to be side by side in the future of crypto currency and blockchain technology. ONTology will be

 more involved with identity, trust, data Dapps onto there platform and have 12 partnership announcements that will

 be on there platform where you see Onchain helps companies and people build blockchain technology itself and

 ONTology will do that as well. Plus soon they will also announce there duel coin system where as with NEO you will 

instead generate ONG and that hasn’t even came out yet wonder what the prices of ONG will be? ONTology provides

 coins into there supply by having air drops and rewarding exchanges for adding them to their exchange and in return

 have trading competitions for holders and traders!! Getting back to ONT prices as of now it is at #45 coin ranking on

 coinmarketcap with a market cap of $351,727,570 and counting and only came out March 8,2018 and as of now

 trading at $1.46 with only 1Billion total supply ever in circulation and as of now only 241,236,451 In there circulating 

supply. This project is easily going to have a $1 Billion market cap which should put the price at around $5. Getting in

 on ONTology now is like getting in on NEO when it was around $14 so this is the next space ship to ride. They will

 bring out massive partnerships and NEO Onchain and ONTology are together the future of cryptocurrency!!! By 2020

 NEO will be the world #1 crypto currency and ONTology will be right on top as well bringing along with the ride GAS

 &amp; ONG!!! By the way Say NEO will be #1 coin in the world is coming straight from the genius and NEO Founder Da

 Hongfei!!! Knowing all this and it’s beautiful structures and way of doing things where do you think the best of the

 best developers would rather have there projects on, many of them are already turning to NEO platform and we can 

only imagine what ONT will bring as well working together next to NEO!!! Where do you think mass adopting will

 happen first in the United States or China, well if I was a betting man and I am my bet is on China!!!! NEO is backed 

by the Chinese government and will be the first to bring mass adopting to the most populated country in the world by

 far!!! We are early adopters in the crypto world and projects like NEO and ONT will bring us to financial freedom!!!!

 Onchain ranks among KPMG’s Top 50 Fintech Companies I’m China for 2016-2017 and soon to be 2018 and beyond.

 Onchain is the father that gave birth to NEO and ONTology, they are a community from the same tree of knowledge

 that are friends creating a massive massive project to use the power beautiful tech of Blockchain Technology!!  Make

 no mistake about it crypto currency are Digital ASSESTS that are finite and will only appreciate in value over time!!!

 We are cutting out our financial institutions, banks, government, corporations and putting the power back in the

 people where it belongs. All over the world people will be connected with out borders in a permission-less system to

 control there own assets and use a global currency that build wealth to all no matter of where you were born, no

matter your race religion or creed, as a citizen of planet earth we will live a decentralized way of living free from 

oppression, uniting the world!!!! I have so much more knowledge and information on a lot of projects and will 

continue to share and keep everyone updated on my favorite coins especially NEO &amp; ONT, I’m not asking for any

 handouts but if you are able to donate any bitcoin I promise to use it to further expand on sharing knowledge and

 wisdom with the time and energy I put in everyday in crypto world. Please feel free to donate to my bitcoin address

 anything helps where in return we can all make serious wealth and I will dedicate my time and energy to

 understanding the market reading TA charts and graphs and let you know of when is the right time to buy and when

 is the right time to sell. Also I will only be providing buying opportunities to the best of the best projects that are

 connected, established and doing the right thing!!! If you lose money then I will be losing money, what I believe in is

 what I invest in. Thank you for reading my opinions and thoughts and many many more wise word to come stated 

turned and we are going to the Moon and beyond!!!!!��

How I missed 3k dollar.","I'm not sure this topic will be accepted as a post, but it's such a sad story I would like to share. As an early enthusiast I was lucky enough to get myself listed in the newsletter and recieved the mail I would get 1000 free Ontology. I was of course kindahappy with it and after a while I received the KYC mail.

Since I was out of town for work I did not had the proper documents with me so I was like well I would do the KYC later. My problem however is that I miss read the deadline. I read KYC Deadline: 23:59 (UTC + 8) February 7th, 2018 as8 February, in stead of February 7. At 8 february I gathered all my documents to see the deadline was all ready overdue..

At this time I was like, well it will probably be around $0,02 a $0,04 so not that bad. Hartbreaking to see it be trading now for $3.-

Anyway I dint dare to share this story with my friends and family because they will get crazy about it, so that's why I bore you guys with it. Be safe trading, remember a lot of people got this for free!

BTC, ETH &amp; NEO trading pairs, trading available from 2300**

I've been really impressed with [KuCoin.com](https://www.kucoin.com/#/signup?r=E3Ij79) since its inception last year, it’s a fast growing and ambitious exchange and is incredibly easy to use. KuCoin has been very active in listing a lot of the higher profile post ICO coins on their exchange before many others (e.g. Dragonchain, Oyster PRL, Origin Trail &amp; Nano) so there's a better chance of catching that moonshot early!

KuCoin was the first exchange to offer NEO trading pairs against other cryptocurrencies and they also pay out the NEO GAS to holders! 

KuCoin offers lots of rewards and incentives to its users such as bonuses for holding their KCS token, trading competitions and luxury car giveaways, as well as offering a 40% trading fee split bonus for new signups, [benefits breakdown](https://i.redd.it/8fvhda3avjtz.jpg).

I hope you found this information useful, if you did I hope you'll be kind enough to sign up using my link/code below! Peace and prosperity to all :)

Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are not doubt about it a invention to this world. And like all inventions and technology when enough human minds are on this working together creating ideas, evolving the new technology that is now being discovered it gets me back to my original question, How early are we with full scale adoption. This is a global phenomenon that is a fetus yet to be born onto the world and change cultures, governments, societies. This is going to connect the world even more so with technology. This is going to give poor people all over the world no matter where they were born or what dictatorship they live under a chance to reconnect to the world and with each other to not only accumulate ASSETS, and create wealth but also connections to a market to live a good day. To survive in this cold world where no one give a fuck about you not really and it is survival of the fitness out here in the crazy world. Step back and see the world for what it is and how we got here and where we are going? We are all one made from atoms and energy call it spirit or soul, call it matter/energy it a phenomenon to think of the possibilities of live and existence. Can we all live together and make this world a utopia society all connected regardless of nationality, race, culture countries. We are on a planet that we share with nature, animals, energy. We are conscious to are own existence of our mortality. We are the universe consciousness that see its own creation and wow it is BEAUTIFUL. Will cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology be the answer to save ourselves from ourselves???? to answer that is to understand what is this invention?? Bitcoin is the first of its kind to take adoption and first of its kind to introduce the world to blockchain technology. What Bitcoin is trying to do is a lot of things. First I believe bitcoin is a digital asset that has value in its belief with the people. It belief that it has value and will continue to have value because the people say so and this has no borders, doesn't care about your race, color or creed. Bitcoin is connecting us as human beings on a dying planet facing our own extintion and our own mortality. Critics of bitcoin will say what kind of value first the PEOPLE decided it has value and willing to buy and sell a digital currency asset. how can you classify bitcoin a asset? The blockchain technology behind bitcoin, as well as acceptance GLOBALLY, connectting the world though the internet through a technological world and the power of blockchain technology behind it where it keeps cryptocurrencies 100% secured to its owner in which a advanced version of blockchain technology has created from ONTOLOGY and NEO. I saw a video of Da Hongfei the co founder and creator of NEO and the CEO i believe for Onchain in which Ontology came from THEY ARE A FAMILY, THEY ARE THE ECO SYSTEM FOR A SMART ECONOMY. Ontology will bring data and Identity to its platform and blockchain technology and bring data itself where only 1% is on the blockchain right now and in 5-10years 100% of data in the world will be on the BLOCKCHAIN and ONTOLOGY AND NEO will be the one that puts it all together and connects the world and can it save us from our inevitable destiny? So back to bitcoin is first of its kind on this new invention and now with great grand minds coming together from all over the world what you see next is advancement of the evolution of technology. NEO is a non profit community that brings developers, community with TRUST and is creating a eco system to PUT THE POWER BACK INTO THE PEOPLE. Ontology is going to be right next to NEO with Identity and you as a human being right to have ownership of these assets of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. They are doing it right in KYC Know Your Customer where the whales and market manipulators don't give the everyday people a chance to get in on this ICO and take ownership. ALL CRYPTOCURRENCIES ARE SO UNDERVALUED. In reference to the ones run legitimately with strong teams, proof of work and trying to disrupt change in the whole system that has fuck us. Oh but that is all now going to change. The power is coming back to the people and it is A UNSTOPABLE FORCE and our government and most importantly our financial system that has put the United States in $21+ trillion dollars in debt. They have borrowed money and printing so much money to the world that make no mistake about it the world #1 world currency is the American Dollar. But how much value is in 1 American Dollar? I ask the same critics that criticize Bitcoin of value. Well yes we as people on this earth give it value in its belief. But can we believe in that government funds wars and has there own agenda but at the same time protect its people and we are the people that need to take the power back. Fiat currency is back by empty promise, it is a ponzi pyramid scheme that got off the gold standard. Whenever you put $1 into your bank, the financial institution get to loan out 10x that amount to its other customers and include negative interest. How the fuck did we get into $21 trillion dollar debt what the fuck. I got news for you USA, that is your own debt and other Countries who turn and mass adopt Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology will be in the forefront to lead us as human beings on Earth.

First post in the ONT community. Currently holding ELA, NEO, ICX and Qash.

Ive been looking to open a position in ONT, but was holding off at the $1.40 price point, as I thought it might dip a bit lower after a bit of hype dies down.

I noticed today that CryptoBud and Crypto Zombie did a top class shill job on ONT, so I jumped on CMC to see it drove any price movement, and sure enough it has jumped a full 30%. Now, I've FOMO'd in a few times in the past, particularly when I first got into crypto, but one thing I've learnt is that these sorts of pumps usually always retrace.

Obviously no one has a crystal ball, but any thoughts or predictions on whether price will come back down after today's pump? ","","877fs7",NA,0,NA,"false",1522358214,"false","self","t5_4blrv","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/OntologyNetwork/comments/877fs7/price_correction/","","",NA,"","",0,0

Interesting (paraphrased) takeaways-
Current blockchain platforms (like neo) are inflexible in the customization of the applications that run on them. In order for businesses to adopt the blockchain, they need to be able to (easily) build their own applications and customize it to their specific needs- all without prior blockchain development experience. 

ONT's child chains allow businesses the freedom to tailor their own blockchain application. In addition, the infrastructure of ONT entails a sophisticated private trust layer that can be utilize by clients needing trust, verification, or identity abilities. ONT will be the link between their private data sources and a public blockchain. Think electronic signatures, face recognition, sensitive data, medical records, etc

Clients on ONT will use ONG (similar to NEO's gas) for things like transactions, storage, and smart contracts.

CryptoBud-""I heard that in the future, through ONT we will not need to hold a passport anymore. Is this true?"" 
Jun LI- ""Actually, we are doing that right now. We are currently linked to China's national EID.

Let's try to compare NEO and ONT but both with the same circulating supply for this example.

If ONT would have a circulating supply of 500 million the project now would value at 700 mio. $ considering that you pay roughly 1,4 $/ONT.

When NEO was around 700 mio. $ with it's circulating supply of 50 mio. NEO (before the October 2017) one NEO cost around 14 $.

Investing in ONT now is like in investing in NEO at 14 $ back than comparing both marketcaps under the same circulating supply of 50 % of their stack in circulation.

I know that ONT has a circulating supply of 240 mio. atm - but when this gets expanded on CMC imho it won't dilute the price of ONT it rather would push the project up the ranks of CMC because the marketcap would more than double. That happened with NEO in October last year when 15 mio. NEO were added - it pushed the project up the ranks and didn't influence the price.

TL:DR: Investing in ONT now is like investing in NEO at 14 $. What is your opinion?

EDIT: Investing in NEO at 14$ was imho more of a gamble back than it is to invest in ONT now - after nearly 1 year NEO council and Onechain made sure they'll become a force in the field of blockchain in China.

So basically the Main Net is coming Q2 (June 30th), and after the launch, details will be released about the ONG airdrops for ONT holders.

Let's say I hold a big bag of ONT in Binance oke.. and the Main Net comes out... does the airdrop come to the Binance exchange or do you need a specific wallet?

Also as we all know, most people sell their coins at main net launch... but if you do that, aren't you eligeble anymore for the ONG airdrops? Like how does this works? Is it possible to sell and buying back in after main net and still be eligeble for the ONG airdrops?

I know that you can make tons trading, but most folks don't.

Let's say you have 100 ONT tokens. That means, for each one dollar movement of price, you can earn 100 dollars if trading at perfect timing. For purposes of conversation, let's say you do this five times and earn 500 dollars. *Unless you re-invest in the same token every time* (which is hard to do, as you may be waiting for a re-entry point that will never happen). This also requires your time, attention and other non-tangible assets to be on reserve.

Now, let's say you hodl through the fluctuations and ONT doubles, going from the 7-ish range to 14 (like OMG did, like NEO did, like ETH did). This is a 700 dollar profit from doing absolutely nothing. And ""double"" is a conservative estimate, considering the market as a whole is way down.

So, in the above example, you can earn 500 by timing perfect trades five times and being glued to your screen all day, or you can fah-gittaboutit and just check back in next month and earn 700. These numbers are just for purposes of conversation, so imagine if you have some zeros attached to em.

Also, I used 14 as a target. This coin is an easy 50 dollar coin. There are repeat ""perfect storms"" in crypto and this one, the project, the community, etc., feels much like ETH, our brother NEO, OMG, etc. It's not a shill cult and it's not an ICO with a use case so abstract that only PnD schemes arise from it.

Naturally THEKEY is a partner of the Ontology network. Ontology focuses on cross chains solution but THEKEY will focuses on IDV and serve as the underlying layer of the Ontology.

I was a firm believer since day 1 that ONT would become something big considering the NEO ecosystem thrives off ONT and vice versa, theres alot more to it than just that but lets just stick with the story.

So basically I'm a student, had a couple of grand saved up, missed the newsletter of 1000 ONT so I was just like meh, nothing I could do about that. All I knew was that I wanted to hold ONT till it hit an absurd market cap. I thought the initial price of it was going to be that of 10 cent each, but yeah I was planning on going all in  and hold till it hit like 2 dollars or something.

Anyways, that same week when I heard all the huobi announcements of ONT and etc, I also discovered leveraging. That was around the same time BTC was on a real weird bear run, apparently due to MT Gox dumping again... AND the patterns really peaked my interest, I leveraged at 100x and got like 0.1 BTC's out of it. I had a total of 0.48 BTC's initially. Now this was when the leveraging started to get out of hand. I put in 0.2 BTC's to leverage with at 100x, I only understood the basics. So basically I lost 0.2 BTC instantly due to the small margin's you would get at 100x. I tried chasing my losses and  I ended up losing everything. 

So basically, wanting to leverage to accumulate more ONT really backfired on me, and now the past 6 weeks its done a 600%+ increase. That would of cleared my student loan which sucks. Most days that I try study I have flashbacks of how debt free I could be.

Oh well, I've slowly accumulated a fraction of what I could of had if I held which isn't too disheartening considering the growth. But still... a part of me still can't forget about how I could of been debt free which keeps me up at night/distracts me from studying most days.

Some posters here should do more then scratch the surface of the Smart Economy (which ONT is a crucial part, as is NEO)

NEO is still the public gateway to the ecosystem with a large dev community and a whole bunch of projects lined up.

It has been said before, but Ill say it again - NEO and Ont complement eachother, each has its space and will be successful in it, they will be interoperable. 

I hold large positions in ONT since the start, but never abbandoned my NEO holdings. I support NEO 100%, and want ONT to suceed 100%.

I see NEO ecosystem as one with the strongest fundamentals in whole cryptosphere - certainly the strongest in China cryptosphere.

First we must consider that ONT just came out on Binance March 8th, 2018 and is a very new coin to hit the market.  As well ONT became public during a bear market and has hold strong during the time it has came out. It is a fact to say that ONT is a very successful Coin reaching minimum 2x gains for now.  Also lets consider the origin of ONT having come from the great minds from Onchain who also came out with NEO project and we all know how well that coin is doing and will continue to do in the future.  Facts remain that ONT and NEO will be working together on each other respective platforms.  You can even consider how the total Market cap was cut in half due to misinformed information of the total current supply out in the market, yet ONT price still holding strong and rising.  ONT total market cap easily should be between $1\-3Billion and that is being conservative in that estimate.  Lets also consider how ONT team gave away 1000 ONT for subscribers and we can only ponder and guess what other airdrops they will provide to ONT holders.  Main net will launch no later then June 30th, 2018 and ONG gas will soon become passive income for ONT holders. So if you are reading this and have ONT or plan to buy ONT, unless your selling and buying back in on dips, then do your future self a favor and never sell ONT since it is Massively Undervalued!!!!!","false","8epxeu",NA,0,NA,"false",1529637659,"false","self","t5_4blrv","false","",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/OntologyNetwork/comments/8epxeu/why_ont_is_massively_undervalued/","t3_8epxeu",NA,NA,"","",0,0

Whats the deal with the Ontology Circulating/Total Supply ratio?

It looks like 11% is owned by people and 89% is owned by investors and team. Is that correct? Are all the tokens minted already or will they be over time? 	

With this ratio this actually looks like a coin with $5B cap, which makes it between NEO and IOTA.

People saying no way ONT can be 2/3 the market cap of NEO, bla bla bla.

Does anyone take a 3-5 year span? 

As anyone bothered to assess the size of markets that could potentially be disrupted by ONT? by NEO? I'll give u a hint - they are in the hundreds of billions. 

China's GDP is over $10 trillion and growing. 5% of that gives you $500B, and even if ONT can capture 20% of that value that still gives $100B in value. Assume a money velocity of 5x that's 20B in (P*Q) ""economic value.

Bla bla bla arguing about whether total supply is 250 million, 500 million, etc.... Let's just assume the worst that it is 1 billion. 

20B of value / 1 billion coins = $20 / coin. 

Or about 5.7x what it is today. 

Don't forget China GDP in 10 years could well be over $20T, so my estimates are conservative. And blockchain's value in this could be well in excess of 5%. 

ONT is partnered with Sequoia China, Danhua, Matrix, and Zhen Fund. Do you guys know who they are? They are some of the top VC funds in China and the world period. They are on the level of Goldman Sachs or Fidelity or Passport Capital.

So please think long-term. Don't be shortsighted. Short-term the market is a voting machine but long term is it is a weighing machine.

**Highlights**

* Other projects with sidechains used for specific use cases such as Loom Network and Aelf.
* Other projects using VBFT: Dfinity. This consensus could become computationally cheaper and faster finality \(i.e. 2 seconds\)
* Connects to multiple chains including Neo as one of those chains.

The number of subscribers and visitors will likely continue to go up very quickly, which will bring a lot of new people in.

A) There will be trolls- **don't feed them.**

B) Some people will ask naive questions- **be nice.** If you respond to someone's post, you are immediately representing this technology as a whole to that person (and others they interact with).

C) Do not deify the developers. I swear to God, Allah, FSM, whatever; **do not let this sub** turn into LTC Charlie Lee cult. It happens slowly over time, be aware of the signs.

D) Chill with the shill. A lot of hate will be gained for this technology likely because of people missing out, or their investments are elsewhere. If you're planning to post things on r/Cryptocurrency, **be humble.** Respond to comments cordially and help guide a discussion- if you're going to make a post, be prepared to effectively moderate your own thread.

* Edit : Bonus; looks like ONT is about to break a billion in MC. This also coincides with placing in the top 20.

I'm a long-term holder of ONT and hope for all the best of the project. I would like to raise awareness to the fact that the circulating supply of Ontology on coinmarketcap is incorrect. This has to due with Coinmarketcap using a different methodology to calculate circulating supply which the Ontology team does not agree with this. See this snapshot from Telegram: ([Click here](https://imgur.com/a/Hk6j7))

The ontology team has actively reached out to Coinmarketcap to update but has yet to get a response. I would like to appreciate that this shows the quality of the Ontology team for trying to correct a mistake of Coinmarketcap. 

  

  The real circulating supply is 537.5 million instead of 241 million. Please read this article for more information on the circulating supply of ONT: https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontologys-ont-token-distribution-and-circulating-supply-da96d5540827. 

  

  **This means that the current market cap of ONT based on the current price of $3.76 is actually 3.76 * 537.5 million = 2.021 billion USD as opposed to 908 million USD. This gives it 2/3th the marketcap of NEO.**


**I am posting this for the reason that I want Ontology to succeed in the long term and not take a potential big dump when people find out the circulating supply is much higher then stated on coinmarketcap.**

Everyone talks about industry and manufacturing on the blockchain, but what use is any of that without identity. For the blockchain to be useful in industry we need to be sure of the provenance any object.  This is the primary missions of ont network.

Ont has a strong team&amp;project

4 major partnerships going to be announced soon

Ont will rise in price until main net launch (very sure of that)

With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I'll rise.

Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.

Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I'll rise.

Did you want to see me broken?
Bowed head and lowered eyes?
Shoulders falling down like teardrops.
Weakened by my soulful cries.

Does my haughtiness offend you?
Don't you take it awful hard
'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines
Diggin' in my own back yard.

You may shoot me with your words,
You may cut me with your eyes,
You may kill me with your hatefulness,
But still, like air, I'll rise.

Does my sexiness upset you?
Does it come as a surprise
That I dance like I've got diamonds
At the meeting of my thighs?

Out of the huts of history's shame
I rise
Up from a past that's rooted in pain
I rise
I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,
Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.
Leaving behind nights of terror and fear
I rise
Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear
I rise
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.
I rise
Moon
I rise
Lambo
I rise.

1) ONT did not have an ICO, the entire supply was initially held by Onchain/Fosun/Neo Council(Neo Foundation now) - they are not and should not be liable to the non-dev community as to how these are distributed (and will later tell why this is my opinion, and why I think its prudent of them)

2) they let into circulation via airdrop to the wider community about 23mil tokens now, and another 6,5mil will be let go when main net goes on+ another undisclosed amount (am guessing 10-20mil) will be airdropped, the rest of the circulating supply was liquidated into the 3 main exchanges (their cold/hot wallets) - Binance, Huobi and Kucoin
CmC is right to draw data from this supply liquidated into the markets

3) Ont team is using an updgraded tech derivate of Onchain DNA (based on). Its new, its oriented to securing distributed trust chains, on which apps could run and private side chains to companies/entities connected via protocols to ONT main and further to NEO main

4) Ont team is highly professional, quite large and funded by Fosun/Onchain FIAT (ie not by their tokens), they plan to provide ONT to companies needing ont for technical working of the side chains (and to ensure these technical provisions of legal contracts/partnership agreements) 

5) ONT project aims to be essentially an SCP with focused ecosystem (part of the NEO Smart Economy) and side chains, it does not aim to be digital cash or that its prime focus is POS token staking (it uses different mechanism anyway)

All being said:

A) The primary reason ONT is even liquidated into the market is to provide visibility of the project to the wider crypto community. Da Hongfei stated CMC visibility is important essentially for marketing purposes

B) There is a rumor that Fosun/NGC is running a market watchdog project to prevent malicious accumulation (might be one of the reasons ONT seems to shoot up during BTC dips and alt drains) - you should look at top 3 wallets and see their accumulation activity during these BTC dips (just 3 days ago 900000 ont was txed in that direction from Binance NEO hot wallet)

C) All being said ONT is a unique and great project that already enjoys support of the wider NEO community here, I like it that they limited circulating supply as I tend to trust NEO/Fosun/Onchain more with the majority of the supply, as they do not view ONT tokens as source of income, but as a source to reward dev community primarily (they are funded by fiat as I said). Whales have no scrupules once they aquire substantial amounts of supply, and see this alleged involvement by Fosun/NGC as a great thing in crypto market (a venture watchdog)

Im happy to hold onto my ont, and see it raising considerably prior to main net launch.

This means that there is an emperor which can overwrite the generals. They don't solve the deecentralization problem.

2) Deploying a smart contract costs [500 Gas](http://docs.neo.org/en-us/sc/tutorial.html). This is expensive compared to other Smart Contracts platforms.

Does Ontology has any of the systems above? 

Thanks

What is so special about this project that keeps jacking up the price in a bear market????? I’ve concluded it’s not the project itself but because there was no public sale. 

Experienced investors know that after an ICO there is a dump in price after the coins hit exchanges which most likely dips near or below ico prices before it goes back up again. With the right timing you can sell/trade some of your coins for profits and keep the rest long term. In ONTs case it’s backwards. There was no public sale meaning everybody had their money ready when it hit exchanges, or found an airdrop of ONT in your wallet from hodling NEO and bought more. Then the FOMOs saw the little green numbers next to ONT compared to the blood bath in the rest of the market and they bought too creating a coin that is on a bull run in a bear market. One could argue how great the team and project is like we haven’t heard the same story with every other coin, but no team or project is that good to beat the bear by themselves.

Ontology is a part of neo not neo is the part of neo think about it about sec :) !","where are rest 76% ontology. Many people don't know that, Ontolology did'nt go through the ICO. Only subscribers got the airdrop and then binance did the airdrop. And after doing the total i can assure you that the total airdrop is not over 20 million out of 1 billion. Ontology is 10:1 to NEO in total supply. One interesting thing mostly people are forgetting that Ontology allocates 10% of total circulation to neo's community, Other 20% to some other long term partners, but neo only did the 20% airdrop out of that. So, the question is where is the rest of them.

I am pretty sure that, rest 80% of ontology Neo has are also going to airdrop on neo token holder's in coming days. Just like they did 20% in 2 different dates not on the same dates. 

2- Ontology also has it's 500million tokens plus the rest of approx 16 million bcz of no public sale. So, i am also expecting some airdrops from ontology side too for Neo's holder. 

3- We can see Ontology github and their team. You people can find many neo developers are also working in ontology. 
Ontology and Neo are twins:
So don't u people feels like neo is extremely extremely undervalued right now. How can a NEO economy can be if ontology is just a part of neo. 
I wrote all this because, i met someone on telegram and he didn't even knw that ontology is a part of neo, they are partners. Both have many same team members. I think you should not hodl one of them. HODL both of them. Just hodl them. if u really want lambo. Bcz don't sell neo and ontology and hodl. One thing i am telling u. NEO is most undervalued right now. We can easily see 1400$+ minimum in the end of this year. This is 28x ur money.
U people are thinking how 1400$. Ethereum was just 15$ in january 2017 and make a high of 1400$ in jan 2019 appx in one year. Just think of second. Neo was 180$ approx. if we go like ethereum then we can hit 5k at the end of year, Neo has much more potential then ethereum bcz neo did'nt even started yet. Just look at the neo team, no words. More quality dapps are now coming on neo. Look at NEX.

Don't think good projects are overvalued. This is open market anyone in the world can buy. if amazon can get 700billion mcap in stocks then in open market sky is the limit. 250billion market cap of crypto is like 1 billion amazon.

Out of the distribution of tokens, we know that not all of community tokens have been airdropped yet (second NEO drop q2.) This would put us somewhere around 60 million tokens, plus what was given to institutional investors (280 million)..  Everything else will be locked.  The question becomes, out of the institutional investors, are any of those tokens actually available on exchanges, I would hypothesize that very, very few are which means we are all fighting over maybe 150 million tokens or something.  What are the thoughts on this or am I missing something?

When the news first broke that circulating supply was actually over double what’s currently listed on CMC, I expected a significant sell-off and for ALH buyers to get burnt pretty badly. The rationale being that a $2.2B+ market cap on a brand new project that hasn’t demonstrated results just yet is far too high – so downside/upside potential is skewed the wrong way. This rationale applied back when ONT was around $3. I just looked at my blockfolio, and my jaw almost hit the floor… we’re knocking on the $5 door right now. 

What the hell is going on here, guys? Sure, ONT is an extremely solid project, but to perform this well in a bear market where prominent projects have been slaughtered and sitting on almost 90% drops kind of defies logic.     

I’m about to give up on the idea that ONT will experience a correction. Can you imagine how it would be performing in a bull market? Crazy. 

I held off FOMOing big in at $3, so I think I’ve well and truly missed the boat – at least for now (but still don’t see this going down, because it seems that conventional wisdom need not apply).

Mining Ontology
Mining in cryptocurrencies is the process of confirming transactions for a reward. In some cases such as with Bitcoin, mining is used to release new coins into the market. Ontology uses Proof-of-Stake consensus model that requires users to own some stake in the network to be able to confirm transactions. A total of one billion tokens were created in the genesis block. The tokens are not dividable into smaller tokens.

The nodes spread in the network will get rewarded with a different token referred as ONG (Ontology GAS). The ONG tokens will be divisible up to one billionth parts and will be earned for 22 years. Note that ONG are used as rewards for confirming transactions and holding a stake in the network.

This implies that any person with a standard computer can mine the Ontology network. You only need to buy ample ONG from the markets and hold them to be rewarded. By running as a node, you will be queued to confirm transactions and get rewarded with ONG.","false","8b1pei",NA,0,NA,"false",1529570935,"false","self","t5_4blrv","false","",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/OntologyNetwork/comments/8b1pei/ont_is_not_divisible_big_deal_i_say_yes/","t3_8b1pei",NA,NA,"","",0,0

&amp;nbsp;

The app is using the official API from coinmarketcap.com, and here is why you should at least try it:

+ **It's a hidden notification, only way to see it is if you drag your notification tab down, you don't even know it's there.**

- It's a lot faster than going on coinmarketcap.com.

* It's free and requires no permissions so it's safe.
 
- Can **set Alarms** and it have **Aggressive Alarm mode**(optional) - perfect when you wanna wake up  during nights

- Can view prices in BTC/USD/EURO.

- View notifications for Top 50 crypto currencies

- ‎Customize your portfolio and view notifications of **your portfolio stats**

&amp;nbsp;

Most of the times people thanks for sharing the app because they didn't knew about it, so why would you downvote this? It helps me and other  users everyday,  why not try it yourself.

I really like ONT, I’m a hodler, and looking to increase my position. On ONTs side of things they’re doing everything right.

However, we’re consistently going up 10/20/30% day over day in a bear markets. There’s massive hourly candles then dumps right after. In addition, we’re one of the only tokens going against the market grain.

While much of this could be attributed to ONts marketing and launch strategy I also don’t think it’s the sole cause.

What’s everyone’s thoughts?

It’s all time high in price was $190 briefly. As of today NEO is worth $68.73 so if you invested $1,000 1 year ago you would have $429,000 TODAY!!! Wonder what more money and more coins would be in a year from now or 2,3,4,5 and beyond years ����!!! This is why I put all my money on Ontology because if we missed the ride on NEO then ONTOLOGY is our next space ride to the moon!!! \(BTW we still haven’t missed the ride with NEO\) Ontology did not have a ICO because they sold out to private investors in which these investors  bought in at $5. Ontology came out on Binance March 8, 2018. For every NEO holder got free .01 Ontology coins ONT which they released there coins prices bought and sold as high as $8.32 in the first day that’s a lot of free coins and money they gave to the community of NEO Holders and it is still trading high at $1.45 \(we’ll actually very very low to its TRUE VALUE!!! NEO And ONTology are together as partners that will create on blockchain technology a smart ecosystem and trust, Identity, Data, Dapps, where these 2 projects are platforms run by the community of coin holders. And in time we will decide how much GAS is required to have to pay from Developers all over the world to add there coins on there platforms as of now NEO has 36 ICO/COINS on there platform with many many many more to come and while yes Ethereum has thousands of coins on there platform we can honestly say a lot of those are coins that will not exists in a couple of years and many many scams, pumps and dumps, and projects that never really take off for a variety of reason\) plus in order to write code on there platform you will need to learn a whole new computer language where as with NEO you can use C\+\+ and JAVA and many others and many more to come. Although I believe it cost 2,500 GAS to build on NEO which is very expensive but brings the real projects with real visions and teams and experience. \(Who would want to pay that much for a pump and dump or scam just a thought\) Also every NEO NeP\-5 token that is on the Platform has strict restrictions to participate in there ICO with KYC “Know Your Customer” where they need to verify your identity very securely to prevent frauds and 100&amp;#37; secures your Digital assets you own. NEO is similar to Ethereum where there will be coins running on there platforms but that’s where the similarities end. First NEO is a non\-profit community\-based blockchain project.  NEO is capable of 10,000 transactions per second versus Ethereum which is capable of 15 transactions per second. Ethereum uses Proof of Work so computers are mining the coins showing proof of work where in NEO it is Proof of Stake \(Just holding NEO Generates GAS a duel coin they provide which is used to pay to run Dapps on there platform and used for very small transaction fees plus you are able to purchase any of there ICO with NEO coins or GAS. As of today GAS is valued at $22.09 with a max supply of 100million and will run out in 22years. Meaning no more GAS EVER created. GAS all time high price in January 2018 was around $79.76!!! The beauty of this system is with the more holdings of NEO coins it generates you GAS that you are able to collect every 5 minutes. Then with GAS you can use it on the open market buy and sell crypto and even better buy more NEO to generate even more GAS until it all runs out. It built like this so you don’t have to sell out of your position on NEO for purchases. For example and this is coming from NEO Founder and I am paraphrasing “So imagine you own Apple stocks and you want to buy a iphone then in order to buy the product you need to sell out of your shares with Apple those losing value in your investment. where in NEO being a coin holder you are not required to sell out and will be generating GAS and by the way GAS is #64 coin on coinmarketcap is a market cap share of $220\+million!! NEO is also Quantum computer proof and where in the future once’s Quantum Computer are being used other coins and platforms will have serious issues, the first and only coin of its kind that is Quantum proof. NEO is also unforkable meaning there can’t be another coin to take over NEO community or a another coin created from NEO. NEO is also hosting their 1st NEO Dev Competition where they are the host and Microsoft yes bill gates Microsoft is the Co\-organizer In a completion will the great developers of the world compete for there ideas and projects powered by blockchain technology NEO and ONTology!!! We have here developers writing white papers presenting code and ideas of building a smart economy. Get this the judge panel are Da Hongfei NEO Founder as well as Erik Zhang NEO Founder &amp; Core Developer, next we have Jun Li who came from Onchain and ONT Founder also side note Onchain is a separate company with Chinese government support  and CEO of Onchain is Da Hongfei that same Da who is NEO Founder. So Jun Li ONT Founder came from Onchain and with him over 60 engineers and many other  well established professionals on a massive team with 5 white papers out and more to come. They are part of same Team to be side by side in the future of crypto currency and blockchain technology. ONTology will be more involved with identity, trust, data Dapps onto there platform and have 12 partnership announcements that will be on there platform where you see Onchain helps companies and people build blockchain technology itself and ONTology will do that as well. Plus soon they will also announce there duel coin system where as with NEO you will instead generate ONG and that hasn’t even came out yet wonder what the prices of ONG will be? ONTology provides coins into there supply by having air drops and rewarding exchanges for adding them to their exchange and in return have trading competitions for holders and traders!! Getting back to ONT prices as of now it is at #45 coin ranking on coinmarketcap with a market cap of $351,727,570 and counting and only came out March 8,2018 and as of now trading at $1.46 with only 1Billion total supply ever in circulation and as of now only 241,236,451 In there circulating supply. This project is easily going to have a $1 Billion market cap which should put the price at around $5. Getting in on ONTology now is like getting in on NEO when it was around $14 so this is the next space ship to ride. They will bring out massive partnerships and NEO Onchain and ONTology are together the future of cryptocurrency!!! By 2020 NEO will be the world #1 crypto currency and ONTology will be right on top as well bringing along with the ride GAS &amp; ONG!!! By the way Say NEO will be #1 coin in the world is coming straight from the genius and NEO Founder Da Hongfei!!! Knowing all this and it’s beautiful structures and way of doing things where do you think the best of the best developers would rather have there projects on, many of them are already turning to NEO platform and we can only imagine what ONT will bring as well working together next to NEO!!! Where do you think mass adopting will happen first in the United States or China, well if I was a betting man and I am my bet is on China!!!! NEO is backed by the Chinese government and will be the first to bring mass adopting to the most populated country in the world by far!!! We are early adopters in the crypto world and projects like NEO and ONT will bring us to financial freedom!!!! Onchain ranks among KPMG’s Top 50 Fintech Companies I’m China for 2016\-2017 and soon to be 2018 and beyond. Onchain is the father that gave birth to NEO and ONTology, they are a community from the same tree of knowledge that are friends creating a massive massive project to use the power beautiful tech of Blockchain Technology!!  Make no mistake about it crypto currency are Digital ASSESTS that are finite and will only appreciate in value over time!!! We are cutting out our financial institutions, banks, government, corporations and putting the power back in the people where it belongs. All over the world people will be connected with out borders in a permission\-less system to control there own assets and use a global currency that build wealth to all no matter of where you were born, no matter your race religion or creed, as a citizen of planet earth we will live a decentralized way of living free from oppression, uniting the world!!!! I have so much more knowledge and information on a lot of projects and will continue to share and keep everyone updated on my favorite coins especially NEO &amp; ONT, I’m not asking for any handouts but if you are able to donate any bitcoin I promise to use it to further expand on sharing knowledge and wisdom with the time and energy I put in everyday in crypto world. Please feel free to donate to my bitcoin address anything helps where in return we can all make serious wealth and I will dedicate my time and energy to understanding the market reading TA charts and graphs and let you know of when is the right time to buy and when is the right time to sell. Also I will only be providing buying opportunities to the best of the best projects that are connected, established and doing the right thing!!!

This will be 288,000/day.

If the ONG is distributed to only the circulating (unlocked) ONT that would be 288,000/123,000,000 = 0.002341463414634 ONG per day per ONT. If someone had 5,000 ONT they would get 11.7 ONG/day.

If the ONG is distributed to all ONT that would be 288,000/1,000,000,000 = 0.000288 ONG per day per ONT. If someone had 5,000 ONT they would get 1.44 ONG/day.

Does anyone know if the locked ONT will receive ONG? And do my calculations look right?

Neoology?","https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2018/05/neo-ontology-going-merge-neoology/

We have recently seen reports coming from NEO, that describe some new movements within NEO and Ontology, that pair the two currencies up, in preparation for moving in a new, common direction. This isn’t a partnership as such, nor is it a merger, but it could indeed lead to some quite exciting developments in both the future of NEO and Ontology.

How does NEO look at the moment?

At the time of writing, NEO is valued at $60.86 and is up 0.25%, nothing spectacular, but given the state of the markets recently, and positive climb should be welcomed with open arms.

How does Ontology look at the moment?

At the time of writing, Ontology is valued at $7.39 and is up 1.57%. Again, this currency has suffered in a negative market recently, although current movements suggest that finally, a recovery could be underway here.

So, where is this merger coming from?

NEO and Ontology have recently signed a ‘Memorandum of Understanding’ this is a formal agreement that can be used to establish a formal partnership. It is not a legally binding contract as such but does signify that the two parties do have serious intent towards working together, something that could eventually lead to an official partnership between the two currencies.","false","8krjuy",NA,0,NA,"false",1529746502,"false","self","t5_4blrv","false","",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/OntologyNetwork/comments/8krjuy/are_neo_and_ontology_going_to_merge_neoology/","t3_8krjuy",NA,NA,"","",0,0

To speed the process up, large short traders usually deploy FUD (upbit is a textbook example which will turn out to be a routine control - my company had one a month ago for example)

Small-mid traders follow. Usially it all breaks down on the newcomers.

1) What to expect from this subredit until monday:

-large amount of fud that will range from delisting rumors, team breakups, tech findings regarding upcoming product (main net)

2) What you should do sith the info:

-do not make rash trading decisions, do not let the fud overcome reason

- once you start researching you will see there is no substance

3) a word of warning about mainstream media:

Crypto reporting is not journalism. Its mostly based on rumors/unamed sources/influencers

Mainstream media is extremely lax in checking reports and bloomberg/wsj and cnbc in particular are willing to report coindesk or ccn stories which later end up being unaubstantiated. 

Mainstream news outlets work for the same VC companies currently opening crypto trading desks and trying to enter the market with nice positions.

Final advice. Try to stay away from checking prices until next wednesday.

Given Ontology's current market cap is $10bn, a daily increase at 5% for another 58 days, will bring market cap to $169bn, overshadowing Bitcoins $165bn current market cap.

Note: the above was based on Ontology's ""Total Supply"". If you are only taking into account of the ""Circulating Supply"", then the current Ontology market cap of $1bn will take 105 days to grow to $168bn

So ONT is the venture arm that will aim to interoperate betwen the central, public platform (NEO) and the side chains.

Current problem with data storage is expenses, it is very expensive to run a central server/backup solutions, services that aim to target sensitive public and private data 

Example of public/private side chain interoperability:

-potential public notary network(ont provided side chain 1) integrated to the land deed registry(ont provided side chain2) with to enable seamless legal circulation of real estate onchain would be an example of 2 public side chain integration + you coul interoperate them with a real estate agency running a dapp on NEO for example)

Its just one example, but companies behind ontology (onchain/Fosun) have large resources at their disposal to research product placement (inbound product marketing research), and drive a “blockchain solution wedge” into an existing centralised solution.

This adoption in essence means cost-cutting for companies, and in some cases higher funcionality.","false","8h676w",NA,0,NA,"false",1529681740,"false","self","t5_4blrv","false","",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/OntologyNetwork/comments/8h676w/ontology_use_case_example_to_provide_use_clarity/","t3_8h676w",NA,NA,"","",0,0

&amp;nbsp;

*Exchange specific* 

&amp;nbsp;

**Q** - Do I need GAS to send my ONT from my NEON wallet to an exchange wallet? 
&amp;nbsp;

**A** – You will need 0.00001 GAS to send your ONT, however your GAS will not be consumed.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Q** – Will ONT be tradable on more big exchanges like Bittrex? 
&amp;nbsp; 

**A** – Ontology team is in contact with other exchanges.   

&amp;nbsp;

**Q** – When will the rest of the supply be released and available for trading? 
&amp;nbsp;

**A** – The rest of the supply will be released in batches in the coming 4 years. Please refer to this Medium article: https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontologys-ont-token-distribution-and-circulating-supply-da96d5540827

*Other* 

&amp;nbsp;

**Q** - What is the circulating supply of ONT
&amp;nbsp; 

**A** - Please note that Coin Market Cap's definition of circulating supply refers to all tokens that are unlocked and in the hands of the public. This definition is different from Ontology's definition in the Medium article above. Ontology’s (ONT) circulating supply of 53.75% refers to all ONT without lock periods (ONT that can be transferred, but not necessary ONT that can be traded at the moment).
&amp;nbsp;

Ontology and Coin Market Cap's definitions are both accurate according to their definitions.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q** - Where did this circulating supply come from? 
&amp;nbsp;

**A** - Below is ONT's distribution proportion with the circulating supply (Ontology's definition) in brackets: 
&amp;nbsp;

- Ontology Community: 12% (12%) 
&amp;nbsp;

- Institutional Partners: 28% (6%) 
&amp;nbsp;

- NEO Council: 10% (10%) 
&amp;nbsp;

- Ontology Ecosystem Development: 25% (12%) 
&amp;nbsp;

- Ontology Technical Community Reward: 10% (10%) 
&amp;nbsp;

- Ontology Core Team: 15% (3.75%)  &amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Q** - Is Ontology (ONT) a NEP-5 or ERC-20 token? 
&amp;nbsp;

**A** - ONT is temporarily a NEP-5 token until the release of MainNet, when it will be a native token.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q** - Will my ONT generate ONG as soon as I receive them? 
&amp;nbsp;

**A** - ONG will be generated only after the MainNet release and swap from NEP-5 ONT to native ONT.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q** - When is MainNet going to launch?
&amp;nbsp;

**A** - Our Mainnet is scheduled to be released in Q2 2018 (by 30 Jun). No further information on the exact date/month that this will take place. You may follow our development milestone progress at https://github.com/ontio/ontology/milestones

&amp;nbsp;

**Q** - How can I do the swap?
&amp;nbsp;

**A** - Please refer to the Medium article - https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/mainnet-ont-token-swap-notice-%E5%85%B3%E4%BA%8Eont%E4%B8%BB%E7%BD%91%E5%88%87%E6%8D%A2%E7%9A%84%E8%AF%B4%E6%98%8E-4cd38c2fc55b

&amp;nbsp;

**Q** - What is the ONG generation rate and total ONG per ONT? 
&amp;nbsp;

**A** - https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/triones-node-incentive-model-dbcb175f4728  

&amp;nbsp;

**Q** – Will there be an ICO for the ONG token?
&amp;nbsp;

**A** – No, you can either buy ONG from the market or hold ONT to generate ONG.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q** - When is the next round of the reward program and how can I subscribe?
&amp;nbsp;

**A** - The next round will take place in Q2 2018 after the release of MainNet. It will not be based on any kind of subscription. Stay tuned to Ontology's social media channels for more infomation in the future.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Q** – When will we receive the second half of the NEO council airdrop?
&amp;nbsp;

**A** – The second half will be distributed after the MainNet launch in late Q2.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q** - What was the block height for the NEO Council airdrop and when will I receive my airdrop? 
&amp;nbsp;

**A** - Snapshot was taken at block height of 1974823. The distribution of the tokens took place in the weeks following March 1st, 2018.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Q** - Does Ontology have any partners yet?
&amp;nbsp; 

**A** - Ontology has already begun many technical partnerships, and several enterprises plan to build applications on Ontology.  

&amp;nbsp;

AKA kadudu888, please STFU.","So kadudu888 and some other FUDsters really like to talk about how ONT's ""true"" market cap is $8 Billion. They get this math by multiplying the total supply, 1,000 mil, by the current price ~$8. There are a few problems here.

First, none of the other market caps on CMC are calculated this way. They are calculated based on CMC's definition of circulating supply, which excludes locked, reserved, privately allocated, and team controlled tokens. In other words, it excludes all tokens that were not bought or given to the public. The basic idea here is that CMC wants to get a close approximation for how much money has flowed into a project. Other's may define circulating differently, and they do. What's important, however, is that there is a consistent method for calculating MC within a given system so that relative valuation can be achieved.

If these FUDsters were being intellectually honest, they would at least be consistent with their critique and would be going around to numerous subs screaming about the incorrect market caps. For example, if we use total supply to calculate market cap, then these coins also need to have their market caps ""corrected."" As homage to our resident FUDster prince, I'll simply refer to this new market cap as 'MC-Dudu,' which I think has a nice ring to it as it evokes the same substance that he/she often spews.

Just a few examples. All numbers in billions.

Ripple - MC-Dudu = $83 (CMC=$32.8)
Tron - MC-Dudu = $9.3 (CMC=$6.1)
NEO - MC-Dudu = $8.4 (CMC=$5.4)

I could go on, but the basic point is if one were to use total supply instead of circulating supply that's fine, but the entire market cap of crypto space would need to be recalculated this way. Moreover, what do we do with the mineable coins with no cap on max supply. Do we give ETH a market cap of infinity?


Second, a lot of this confusion comes down to the awkwardness of using a valuation metric designed to measure the value of a publicly traded company, and applying it to a decentralized currency. A stock has things like profit, tangible assets and free cash flow, which enables investors to tie the value of the company to something a bit more real. So when someone says something like, ""X coin has a market cap of Y!! That's 5 times the value of Z company! What a joke!"" You can safely dismiss them as a moron (or more forgivingly, simply ignorant).  In crypto, if market cap has any utility its for RELATIVE valuation. Since outside of MC-Dudu's world, market caps are determined using a consistent system, we can still use the misplaced metric to determine the rank order valuation of a company.

So when I look at ONT from a relative value perspective and compare it to the other coins in the top 50, it seems to me that it has a lot of room to grow. Most of those coins are shit coins and in 5 years they will likely be completely irrelevant. 

Lastly, where our FUDsters can make some legitimate argument is by saying that ONT themselves declared their circulating supply to be ~538 mil not 113 mil. This is true, ONT defines circulating supply differently than CMC. The 400+ mil difference that should not be overlooked is that while these coins are unlocked, the majority of them are under the direct control of Onchain. So, while it is theoretically possible that Onchain could suddenly flood the market with 4x the supply and tank the price, the likelihood of this happening is exceptionally low. These are very intelligent people. If they can figure out how to create a cross-chain platform, I'm sure they understand supply and demand well enough to avoid doing this. Especially because tanking ONT's price would be devastating to their brand, which is far too valuable to them. 

This isn't a situation where a coin had a massive ICO and sold off all their coins to a bunch of whales, and now we're all just waiting for them to come in an crash the price. ONT kept their coins in-house so they're the only ones who can crash the price. Now if you're don't have enough faith in the Onchain team to believe they wont do this, then you really shouldn't invest in ONT. Moreover, you really should't waste your time spamming a Reddit sub about it. Here are the choices for MC-Dudu and his/her ilk. One, go educate yourselves and come back with constructive criticism based on facts and logic. Two, go away and direct your energies towards finding a project you believe in. And three, call your mommy and cry about how the mean market went and made money without you until you feel better. 

Good luck to all you ONTers out there!","false","8gd988",NA,0,NA,"false",1529667220,"false","self","t5_4blrv","false","",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/OntologyNetwork/comments/8gd988/a_guide_to_addressing_ont_market_cap_fud_aka/","t3_8gd988",NA,NA,"","",0,1

Ontology


Ontology (ONT) – Smart contracts are great and can help businesses cut on costs. That’s because they eliminate the need for middlemen in some of the contracts that businesses engage in. But why aren’t business making use of smart contracts at scale?  The reason is simple, they are complicated! Smart contracts are complex and it takes some high level understanding of computer programming to create one. This has been a serious barrier for most business looking to create and execute them. Ontology is designed to solve this problem and take smart contracts to the masses.

One of the key aspects of Ontology is that it has standardized smart contracts that any business can use to create a smart contact of their choice. This is a major step towards the adoption of smart contracts because any business owner can create and execute a smart contract, without much cost or time involved.","false","8gdduu",NA,0,NA,"false",1529667282,"false","self","t5_4blrv","false","",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/OntologyNetwork/comments/8gdduu/what_it_is_about_and_why_is_it_pumping/","t3_8gdduu",NA,NA,"","",0,0

ONT is a very new coin to hit the market and is back by Onchain and NEO so you know big things await for projects that come from these great minds. ONTology has the advantage to learn from past projects from the good and bad and expand on that plus have new ways of implicating blockchain technology. Many coins have whale manipulation but it seems that ONT is the exception to the rule since most is lock up and there was restrictions from the beginning in private investors.  Once out to the public the price is determined by the demand and oh boy the demand is huge. This is one coin in 2018 and beyond that we are about to TRUST the project itself and especially the team behind it as well. ONT will have a similar rise like NEO if not even more so since they are working together and ONT is solving the problem of TRUST and bottom line is we as a community can sleep good at night knowing that big things will come from ONTology into the future and beyond.

Ontology provides new high-performance public blockchains that include a series of complete distributed ledgers and smart contract systems.

Ontology blockchain framework supports public blockchain systems and is able to customize different public blockchains for different applications. Ontology supports collaboration amongst chain networks with its various protocol groups.

Ontology will constantly provide common modules on the underlying infrastructure for different kinds of distributed scenarios, such as those for the distributed digital identity framework, distributed data exchange protocol, and so on. Based on specific scenario requirements, Ontology will continue to develop new common modules.

Ontology uses a dual token (ONT and ONG) model. At first, ONT is a NEP-5 token and does not release ONG. After the launch of Ontology's MainNet (Late June 2018), users will be able to exchange NEP-5 ONT for ONT on the Ontology MainNet, which will start to release ONG periodically.","false","8mxb0u",NA,0,NA,"false",1529785323,"false","self","t5_4blrv","false","",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/OntologyNetwork/comments/8mxb0u/for_newcomers_what_is_ont/","t3_8mxb0u",NA,NA,"","",0,0

It’s all time high in price was $190 briefly. As of today NEO is worth around $80 so if you invested $1,000 1 year ago you would have $429,000 TODAY!!! Wonder what more money and more coins would be in a year from now or 2,3,4,5 and beyond years ����!!! This is why I put all my money on Ontology because if we missed the ride on NEO then ONTOLOGY is our next space ride to the moon!!! \(BTW we still haven’t missed the ride with NEO\) Ontology did not have a ICO because they sold out to private investors in which these investors  bought in at $5. Ontology came out on Binance March 8, 2018. For every NEO holder got free .01 Ontology coins ONT which they released there coins prices bought and sold as high as $8.32 in the first day that’s a lot of free coins and money they gave to the community of NEO Holders and it is still trading high at $1.45 \(we’ll actually very very low to its TRUE VALUE!!! NEO And ONTology are together as partners that will create on blockchain technology a smart ecosystem and trust, Identity, Data, Dapps, where these 2 projects are platforms run by the community of coin holders. And in time we will decide how much GAS is required to have to pay from Developers all over the world to add there coins on there platforms as of now NEO has 36 ICO/COINS on there platform with many many many more to come and while yes Ethereum has thousands of coins on there platform we can honestly say a lot of those are coins that will not exists in a couple of years and many many scams, pumps and dumps, and projects that never really take off for a variety of reason\) plus in order to write code on there platform you will need to learn a whole new computer language where as with NEO you can use C\+\+ and JAVA and many others and many more to come. Although I believe it cost 2,500 GAS to build on NEO which is very expensive but brings the real projects with real visions and teams and experience. \(Who would want to pay that much for a pump and dump or scam just a thought\) Also every NEO NeP\-5 token that is on the Platform has strict restrictions to participate in there ICO with KYC “Know Your Customer” where they need to verify your identity very securely to prevent frauds and 100&amp;#37; secures your Digital assets you own. NEO is similar to Ethereum where there will be coins running on there platforms but that’s where the similarities end. First NEO is a non\-profit community\-based blockchain project.  NEO is capable of 10,000 transactions per second versus Ethereum which is capable of 15 transactions per second. Ethereum uses Proof of Work so computers are mining the coins showing proof of work where in NEO it is Proof of Stake \(Just holding NEO Generates GAS a duel coin they provide which is used to pay to run Dapps on there platform and used for very small transaction fees plus you are able to purchase any of there ICO with NEO coins or GAS. As of today GAS is valued at $22.09 with a max supply of 100million and will run out in 22years. Meaning no more GAS EVER created. GAS all time high price in January 2018 was around $79.76!!! The beauty of this system is with the more holdings of NEO coins it generates you GAS that you are able to collect every 5 minutes. Then with GAS you can use it on the open market buy and sell crypto and even better buy more NEO to generate even more GAS until it all runs out. It built like this so you don’t have to sell out of your position on NEO for purchases. For example and this is coming from NEO Founder and I am paraphrasing “So imagine you own Apple stocks and you want to buy a iphone then in order to buy the product you need to sell out of your shares with Apple those losing value in your investment. where in NEO being a coin holder you are not required to sell out and will be generating GAS and by the way GAS is #64 coin on coinmarketcap is a market cap share of $220\+million!! NEO is also Quantum computer proof and where in the future once’s Quantum Computer are being used other coins and platforms will have serious issues, the first and only coin of its kind that is Quantum proof. NEO is also unforkable meaning there can’t be another coin to take over NEO community or a another coin created from NEO. NEO is also hosting their 1st NEO Dev Competition where they are the host and Microsoft yes bill gates Microsoft is the Co\-organizer In a completion will the great developers of the world compete for there ideas and projects powered by blockchain technology NEO and ONTology!!! We have here developers writing white papers presenting code and ideas of building a smart economy. Get this the judge panel are Da Hongfei NEO Founder as well as Erik Zhang NEO Founder &amp; Core Developer, next we have Jun Li who came from Onchain and ONT Founder also side note Onchain is a separate company with Chinese government support  and CEO of Onchain is Da Hongfei that same Da who is NEO Founder. So Jun Li ONT Founder came from Onchain and with him over 60 engineers and many other  well established professionals on a massive team with 5 white papers out and more to come. They are part of same Team to be side by side in the future of crypto currency and blockchain technology. ONTology will be more involved with identity, trust, data Dapps onto there platform and have 12 partnership announcements that will be on there platform where you see Onchain helps companies and people build blockchain technology itself and ONTology will do that as well. Plus soon they will also announce there duel coin system where as with NEO you will instead generate ONG and that hasn’t even came out yet wonder what the prices of ONG will be? ONTology provides coins into there supply by having air drops and rewarding exchanges for adding them to their exchange and in return have trading competitions for holders and traders!! Getting back to ONT prices as of now it is at #45 coin ranking on coinmarketcap with a market cap of $351,727,570 and counting and only came out March 8,2018 and as of now trading at $1.46 with only 1Billion total supply ever in circulation and as of now only 241,236,451 In there circulating supply. This project is easily going to have a $1 Billion market cap which should put the price at around $5. Getting in on ONTology now is like getting in on NEO when it was around $14 so this is the next space ship to ride. They will bring out massive partnerships and NEO Onchain and ONTology are together the future of cryptocurrency!!! By 2020 NEO will be the world #1 crypto currency and ONTology will be right on top as well bringing along with the ride GAS &amp; ONG!!! By the way Say NEO will be #1 coin in the world is coming straight from the genius and NEO Founder Da Hongfei!!! Knowing all this and it’s beautiful structures and way of doing things where do you think the best of the best developers would rather have there projects on, many of them are already turning to NEO platform and we can only imagine what ONT will bring as well working together next to NEO!!! Where do you think mass adopting will happen first in the United States or China, well if I was a betting man and I am my bet is on China!!!! NEO is backed by the Chinese government and will be the first to bring mass adopting to the most populated country in the world by far!!! We are early adopters in the crypto world and projects like NEO and ONT will bring us to financial freedom!!!! Onchain ranks among KPMG’s Top 50 Fintech Companies I’m China for 2016\-2017 and soon to be 2018 and beyond. Onchain is the father that gave birth to NEO and ONTology, they are a community from the same tree of knowledge that are friends creating a massive massive project to use the power beautiful tech of Blockchain Technology!!  Make no mistake about it crypto currency are Digital ASSESTS that are finite and will only appreciate in value over time!!! We are cutting out our financial institutions, banks, government, corporations and putting the power back in the people where it belongs. All over the world people will be connected with out borders in a permission\-less system to control there own assets and use a global currency that build wealth to all no matter of where you were born, no matter your race religion or creed, as a citizen of planet earth we will live a decentralized way of living free from oppression, uniting the world!!!! I have so much more knowledge and information on a lot of projects and will continue to share and keep everyone updated on my favorite coins especially NEO &amp; ONT, I’m not asking for any handouts but if you are able to donate any bitcoin I promise to use it to further expand on sharing knowledge and wisdom with the time and energy I put in everyday in crypto world. Please feel free to donate to my bitcoin address anything helps where in return we can all make serious wealth and I will dedicate my time and energy to understanding the market reading TA charts and graphs and let you know of when is the right time to buy and when is the right time to sell. Also I will only be providing buying opportunities to the best of the best projects that are connected, established and doing the right thing!!! If you lose money then I will be losing money, what I believe in is what I invest in. Thank you for reading my opinions and thoughts and many many more wise word to come stated turned and we are going to the Moon and beyond!!!!!��","false","8g4sxk",NA,0,NA,"false",1529663057,"false","self","t5_4blrv","false","",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/OntologyNetwork/comments/8g4sxk/why_ont_is_rising_and_will_continue_to_rise/","t3_8g4sxk",NA,NA,"","",0,0

The market is in the red today, with bitcoin dropping below $8000.  While this is making some people skeptical about the crypto market, this is actually the best time to invest in good crypto projects. One project that looks heavily undervalued at current prices is Ontology (ONT). At the moment, Ontology is trading at around $6.48, after losing close to 11% in the last few hours. This is a good entry point for a project that has the potential to hit $100 and above in the future. Just in case you are wondering why Ontology has the potential for such a high valuation, let’s go through some of the reasons that will take give it a major boost.

One of the greatest strengths to Ontology is that it is meant to allow business that have no experience with blockchain technology, comfortably integrate this technology into their systems. Ontology has built a decentralized infrastructure, which makes business on-boarding to blockchain easy and efficient. Considering that decentralization is the future, which is why big business is taking interest, on-boarding blockchains like Ontology will play a central role in the future of business.

How did ONT outperform the market so spectacularly?","Like many peeps here, I'm a longtime NEO fan who got into ONT at the start and have watched in awe and joy as the value has quickly catapulted upwards. What an epic run we've seen over the past couple weeks! 

Based on the success of the Antshares/NEO rebranding, and the subsequent evolution of the Smart Economy, we knew Da Hongfei to be a savvy and shrewd player in the crypto space. But I don't think any of us foresaw the strength and velocity of this early ONT success. It has become apparent that Da and Jun Li have orchestrated a brilliant, atypical coin rollout that all but ensured a triumphant debut for ONT.

Now of course the ONT fundamentals are super strong, and an early glance through the multiple whitepapers or the extensive and detailed website would have confirmed that to any interested observer. None of this would have happened if ONT is not a carefully thought\-out project with abundant real value for businesses. But I'm talking more about marketing/finances here. How did ONT outperform the market so spectacularly?

First off, there was no ICO, which is a rare luxury afforded to projects that aren't reliant on public funds for their buildout \(or who raise funding privately\). Of course with NEO valued in the multi billions, and presumably all the ONT principals already wealthy, seed financing was never the issue for ONT. They raised their funding privately, in fiat currency, from savvy venture capitalists.

Then they embarked on a massive campaign to GIVE AWAY Ontology! First to early subscribers of the newsletter \(I missed that one, d'oh\), to attendees at NEO DevCon \(I missed that one too\), and to holders of NEO \(caught that one thankfully\). Giving away free tokens—with actual value, not some worthless crap—instead of asking for investment is the most brilliant counter\-intuitive move ever, and it ensured that interested parties would have a vested interest from the start.

Turns out those were the most generous airdrops in crypto history—1000 free ONTs are worth north of $10k as I write this, which is just incredible. Smart followers who maybe didn't have the bankroll are now on the greatest freeroll ever. I know some of these people sold out around $2, where ONT stalled for a bit early on. It took patience and determination to wait out the minor downswing, like all good things in life and crypto.

Then, they ran a super\-generous contest on Binance that gifted 1000  ONTs to folks who held a high amount \(I stupidly missed that one too\). So a few sharp investors basically got $20,000\+ for just clicking their mouse a few times. Of course, only a team with the deep connections of NEO could have gotten that instant Binance listing and carried out that contest so smoothly.

And now today, with the new Upbit listing and a new contest \(limited to Korean nationals\), there's another giant incentive to purchase and hold ONT in one of the world's most active markets, which is driving up the price and adding value for all of us.

There have been rumors floated that some of the original ONT investors have literally made sure that ONT stays on the upward trajectory by pumping money in when the market was tanking. I have no idea if this is true, but it was very interesting to watch on a number of days last month that ONT was the only coin in the green when BTC, NEO and all the big ones were down. I speculated that maybe some big announcements were coming... and to be clear ONT has announced a steady stream of important partners and new developments.

The only negative \(and this has been raised, discussed and debunked many times already in this community\) is the circulating supply, the large amount of tokens being withheld by the principals \(90&amp;#37;\). To that I say: I trust the principals, I trust the project, I trust Da and Jun, they've taken us this far so quickly. Why would they ever do anything to hurt the value of ONT? And moreover, how can anyone complain after this incredible run? That 90&amp;#37; withholding hasn't hurt ONT prices, has it? Again, in a counter\-intuitive way it seems to be boosting the price, making each liquid ONT more valuable. In fact I believe there's a strategic reason for this approach that has not been revealed, and will be become clear to us down the road. 

As for myself, I'm up over 450&amp;#37; and will continue to hold for higher prices, for Mainnet and for the ONT/ONG rollout. I took some small profits on the way up—sold like 10&amp;#37; of my position which seemed smart at the time but now I wish I held it. 

With a super\-strong product in the works, the most genius team in crypto, big announcements every week, there's every reason to be super bullish about the future of ONT. Whatever their ultimate plan is, it's working.","false","8gu5i2",NA,0,NA,"false",1529675660,"false","self","t5_4blrv","false","",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/OntologyNetwork/comments/8gu5i2/smartest_coin_rollout_in_the_history_of_crypto/","t3_8gu5i2",NA,NA,"","",0,1

While we can see the market clearly plummeting, Ontology (ONT) is refusing to take on the latest trend in the market, which means ONT makes up for one of the rare top coins that are currently being traded in the green. However, there is more up to this case than sheer luck. So, let’s see what the top reasons for having Ontology trade as one of the rare coins that are doing great even despite the negative market trend are.

One of the greatest things that always go by inertia while affecting a certain coin to sky-rocket to the moon is having the mentioned coin listed on a new exchange. That is precisely what happened to Ontology (ONT) as it just got listed on Upbit.

The Upbit listing came in the late March of 2018 when the majority of currencies were going down by following the active trend of having a long market crash, which made ONT gain some exposure while consequently collecting gains in the market.


On May 2nd of 2018, Upbit announced via their official Twitter account that they will be giving out additional ONT units to all ONT holders that, in the time of taking snapshots, have their Ontology coins kept safely on their account. Maximum payouts on weekly basis go from 1000 ONT to 125.000 ONT units.

As most people know NEO has been hugely successful when they rebranded from Antshares and then started generating GAS.

Now comes the second chance if you missed NEO's rise.

Ontology (ONT) is the trust network that will connect Blockchain to the real world making it easier for institutional players to come into the space.

Also as NEO generates GAS, Ontology will also generate ONG (Ontology Gas) This is an amazing system and its on discount now.

Don't forget they didn't have an ICO so whales can't buy up a crap load then dump it on exchanges. Keep that in mind. The value is extremely good and with the mainnet 4 weeks away I hope you can pick it up cheap.

 \[In reply to Sivan Botani\]

We're in communication with ledger to provide hardware wallet support in our ONTO client. Please register your interest with ledger to help us expedite the process: [https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/requests/new](https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)  


So I sent them an email yesterday and I just got this response back. Doesn't sound very promising.  


Hello ,  


Thank you for your email.  


Integration for ONT MainNet has not been planned yet, but since Ledger is open source we always welcome anyone                   
who wish to collaborate for an external development.  


You can find our future integration on our official [road map](https://trello.com/b/5nQ1mdzt/ledger-roadmap).   


Kind Regards,  
Nicole

Must read for Ontology hodlers!","Ontology [ONT] partners with CarBlock, steps into automobile industry!

Today, Ontology, a distributed trust collaboration platform, and public multi-chain project announced their partnership with CarBlock, a transport system solution provider based on blockchain and smart contracts. CarBlock has nearly 410,000 active vehicles, and claims to offer real-world applications, like peer-to-peer rentals, auto insurance, car maintenance, and repair, and also used car dealerships and car reports using CAR tokens.

The two companies will collaborate in core technology, integrate business resources, and cooperate in community operations. It was also announced that CarBlock will airdrop tokens to cars and their owners who are certified by Ontology.

As per Ontology’s real economy strategy, CarBlock would take up the task of building a platform to store the transport data, based on blockchain technology and vehicle network intelligent hardware. This platform will combine Ontology’s chain network platform with CarBlock’s intelligent hardware and IoT solutions to efficiently and fairly circulate vehicle data within the ecosystem.

This would usher in a brand new smart transport platform into the US’s automobile industry valued at $1 trillion.

Ontology has recently announced its partnership with COT on 28th May 2018. COT became the first strategic partner of ONT in technology and intelligence. The aim is to increase opportunities and improve their standings in the cryptocurrency world. 

The major concern is structuring the required hardware to compute IoT (Internet of Things) on the technology. This is of utmost importance as their multi-chain network will not function properly in the blockchain. Being a provider of IoT network, Chain of Things (COT) has an experienced technology faculty team in the field of intelligence hardware and IoT.

Chain of Things is looking forward to collaboratively build a platform on the network’s chain. The project will be guided by Ontology’s strategy. The newly built platform will focus on trust and transactions and thus strengthen business and the support communities. They will join their core technologies to solidify the platform. According to Wen Wang, the founder of COT, the objective of the COT cooperative public chain system is to address the areas in which businesses are facing problems. Partnering with Ontology means that they will jointly “establish a data exchange and digital identity collaboration platform to jointly promote the development and success of a system which fully integrates objects with our digital world.”",NA,"8ouk5n",NA,0,NA,"false",1536338720,"false","self","t5_4blrv","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/OntologyNetwork/comments/8ouk5n/ontology_up_8_partnerships_and_triones_seed_note/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

Ontology is one of the high-flying cryptos in the market. Though its rise was checked by the recent bearish market, its strong platform gives it a shot for another bull run before the end of 2018.

The platform offers users a public blockchain that provides an appealing tool for distributed ledgers as well as dApps and smart contracts.

The platform can also be customized to be used in any number of applications.

When it traded for the first time in March, ONT coins were valued at just over $1.2. However, it rose to reach $11 by early May. The slight drop took it to around $7 and now is looking to rally again to higher levels. It currently has a market cap of $1.2 billion and sees a daily trading volume of over $112.

Verdict:Ontology is in a unique position as it seeks to break above new highs. Its relationship with NEO and OnChain plus the dual token structure will be big factors going forward. Having moved from 35th to 19th position in a few weeks illustrates its potential.

Da Hongfei (NEO) , Jun Li (ONT).

Those three individuals started their own project which you might already know : NEO and ONTOLOGY and now NKN.

NKN  is aiming at decentralizing the internet layer at the protocal level.  It is a long term hold, but in a few days they will release their source  code and updated roadmap, just like Ontology did.

Knowing  how the Onchain DNA architecture is  what inspired NEO and ONT, i am  assuming NKN will be of very high caliber as well, and maybe pull a ONT  run when people realize who is behind this project.

I also wouldn't be surprised if future announcements and collaborations between NEO, ONT and NKN are in the works.

WHat do you guys feel? It seems the community is sleeping on this project.

As I previously mentioned, THEKEY has made another significant progress in last 3 weeks since the AMA dated Jun 5th.

I am glad to announce that the recent 20th of June 2018, THEKEY, the Information Center of the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security (MHRSS) and the China Social Insurance Association (CSIA) have reached a cooperative agreement in researching social insurance blockchain applications.

The application of blockchain technology in social insurance industry is unprecedented.

So far, blockchain application mainly focuses on the issuance and payment of cryptocurrency and generates profit from the token price fluctuation. It has rarely been applied in any industry on a large scale. Only if blockchain technology can be utilized in the major industries, will it realize its social value and then its commercial value. To be applied by the world’s largest insurance payer in services to 1.4 billion Chinese people, it is anticipated to fundamentally change the healthcare industry. It will surely be a global breakthrough signaling the real world value and use of blockchain technology for the social good.

On the 30th of June the official kick-off meeting related to launching this research was held in Beijing with high-level government officials from the relevant departments within MHRSS, THEKEY and other vested interest social organizations, enterprises, experts and scholars.

In support of the above research agreement, and in order to overcome the technical and regulatory obstacles of this challenging research and commercialization task ahead, THEKEY has launched a scientific research fund totaling 20 million USD that will be deployed with the relevant academic and commercial institutions/personnel. The Fund is dedicated to developments and applications of blockchain technologies in social insurance services.

Announced during the press conference of the Fund Launch, the 2018/2019 Projects of The Racing Plan under the Fund is calling for Expression of Interests. Relevant instructions and application forms will be downloadable on THEKEY official website by July 15th 2018.

We are confident that the Fund will facilitate the research and development required to build new technologies, business models and efficiencies in social insurance service to the Chinese, then global masses.

Regarding the new situation and progress, I will hold an AMA on Reddit at 8:00 pm (GMT +8) July 4th, welcome to join me through the link below: [https://www.reddit.com/r/THEKEYOFFICIAL/comments/8u5yx7/thekey\_ama\_at\_800\_pm\_july\_4th\_gmt8/](https://www.reddit.com/r/THEKEYOFFICIAL/comments/8u5yx7/thekey_ama_at_800_pm_july_4th_gmt8/)

I checked the block explorer at the time and everything reflected what was shown in my wallet. 

I managed to find a generous person who donated 0.01 ONG so i could send the ONT to myself.  Once i completed my transaction my ONG balance dropped by 100 and a small balance was left that was claimable. There is no record of this ONG going anywhere and its as if i never had them in the first place. I cant seem to get an answer from any dev, telegram moderator or twitter account. 

I have a theory that this claimed ONG was the accumulated portion of that, which i held on the exchange and possibly moved to the Binance hot wallet for redistribution.  What concerns me is there is no record of this transaction on my end. To add to the frustration after using the 0.01 ONG to create the first transaction i now need more ONG to claim my ONG. Does anyone here have a clue on what the F$#% is going on ?

Its been a very poor launch from this coin and the team especially in contrast to vechains launch which was seamless i hope they pick up there game.

since this morning, the ont explorer swapped the values for claimable and unbound ONT. So there is happening something behind the scenes I guess.

Stilll annoying that althoough I have 0.07 Cllaimablle ONT now, a claim still needs ONG at first. Also the unbound ONT keeps locked - no matter if I sent more ONT to my wallet. Outgoing transactions arnt possible.

If anyone has spare ONG for me to test please sent like 0.02 - ill refund with a little extra.

I have all my NEOs on my NEO wallet. I received my first airdrop on my NEO wallet (NEP 5 tokens).

For the second airdrop, i read that it would be received directly on the ONT wallet and that it will be ONT mainnet tokens directly.

So i dowloaded ONTO wallet, used import wallet functionnality, created a random ONT ID, then tried to import wallet with my NEO wallet private key OR keystore, both results as invalid. I read that we should use the same to access ONT mainnet tokens. Source :

Dear Community Members:

On the 20th of June 2018 – two weeks ago, THEKEY, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security (MHRSS) of the People’s Republic of China, and the China Social Insurance Association (CSIA) entered into a Cooperative Agreement on Research into Blockchain Applications for Chinese Social Insurance Scheme, which establishes a new National Laboratory dedicated to exploring Blockchain Technology applied to Social Insurance. This is the official launch of THEKEY’s application of blockchain technology in service to the world’s largest insurance entity.

Against this background, and in support of the above Laboratory, this same day I also announced the launch of a Scientific and Research Fund through which, over the next five years, we will channel a total of 20 million USD to both Chinese and global research institutes for the purpose of comprehensively addressing all of the challenging technical, management and regulatory issues that lay ahead for us.

With blockchain technology, and our proprietary BDMI (Blockchain based Dynamic and Multi-dimension Identification) platform as a competitive advantage, we at THEKEY are dedicated to fundamentally improving the management of China’s social insurance services and, consequently, the efficiency, resilience and health of its funds. We are working to do so from the following six perspectives:

1. Blockchain technology can systematically reduce the risk of distrust between the different institutions across the Chinese social insurance ecology. By nature, being “undeniable and unalterable”, blockchain technology is able to address the trust issues through betterment and improvement of integrity, reliability and accuracy of the insurance data, including profile and transaction records of insured.
2. The use of smart contract technology to automatically settle claims increases the efficiency of relevant transactions.
3. Records transacted on the blockchain are traceable, undeniable and unalterable, and thus are optimal for meeting the requirements of social insurance audits - further reducing fraud, abuse and waste of social insurance funds.
4. The use of Blockchain can and will greatly improve the efficiency of social insurance payments, transactions, clearance and settlement by enabling simultaneous clearance, settlement and data audits. Transactions that have historically taken days will now take minutes.
5. Blockchain will significantly reduce operational costs for the social insurance agencies. Currently, cross-institution and cross-department transactions plus associated internal audit procedures are extremely tedious, time-consuming and expensive. By simplifying social insurance procedures and reducing the foreground and background interaction through blockchain, the social insurance agencies will increasingly be able to deliver far better service to consumers at far lower cost.
6. Finally, the deployment of blockchain will also facilitate the increased commercialization, application and general value of social insurance data by ensuring not only more secure data transmission and transactions across various stakeholder institutions.

We are greatly honored to have this unique opportunity to serve the Chinese social insurance. What is most exciting about this activity is that it is not only a breakthrough for THEKEY and its partners in China, but also a ground-breaking event for the global blockchain industry, which are now provided with an unparalleled real-world application scenario by the Chinese social insurance.

1. Chinese social insurance scheme currently covers nearly 1.4 billion people. It has collected invaluable real-name social insurance data across China’s entire population. Providing optimal protection and use of these data across the different vested interest entities through blockchain technology can realize value via these data, which represents a very clear and lucrative business model for THEKEY.
2. The existing Management Information System of the Chinese social insurance can be used by THEKEY, with slight modification, for the application and promotion of blockchain technology nationwide, which will greatly reduce our investment in the corresponding infrastructure.
3. As the largest payer in country, the Chinese social insurance has very strong power to lead the society to reach a positive and healthy consensus, from which THEKEY will be greatly benefited.
4. China’s social insurance system delivers universal coverage to all of its citizens. More significantly, it is an indispensable and frequently used component of the lives of all of our nearly 1.4 billion citizens. Therefore, the related blockchain products can be promoted quickly and widely to form an extremely large user base of THEKEY at very low cost.

To date most blockchain applications have mainly focused on the issuance and transactions related to cryptocurrency and profit generation from speculation related to token price fluctuation. As such the application of blockchain cannot be considered a significant social revolution.

But to the extent that the unique and evolutionary advantages of blockchain technology can and will increasingly be used to address fundamental social issues related to people’s livelihood, quality of life and national economy, the evolution of blockchain will realize ever greater magnitudes of social, economic and commercial value and recognition.

I strongly believe that the THEKEY is in the process of delivering a historical breakthrough by being the first ever to use the blockchain technology to improve the lives of magnitudes of populations never before realized with this technology. Indeed we are confident that we are going to quickly emerge as the world’s largest social impact blockchain project covering the world’s largest population – and delivering the greatest measurable social and commercial value.

I am quite confident THEKEY is now on the right track, and that we are already beginning to enjoy a better tomorrow from a true value perspective!

Made the ONT swap a week ago using the ontology app that was pinned on the official telegram channel and I don't know if it's the reason. Also I have entered my private key at [neotracker.io](http://neotracker.io/) and now all my tokes are gone, I always use the keystore file or private keys to open my wallet at neo tracker but this is the first time that this catastrophe to my life happened. Found history that tokens were transferred to this address AbburVQZV8GG3BQispiYowyqFQHSkGPUfd . are there any way to recover the funds or atleast freeze the address or bank account where it was transfered to? 

These are my lifetime savings and I dont know what to do and how to go back up again :'( :'( :'( :'(. Here is my NEO public address Ad1agS8qdBqhCokJUXCPushepkBweySQJK. Please help me do recover the funds or atleast freeze the address it was sent to.

I'm a solid crypto believer specially NEO and ONT and I just can't believed this happened. I've already message the neo council, ontology council thru several social media platforms but no one responding. Seems like they don't care. . I've contacted [recovermycrypto.com](http://recovermycrypto.com/) as well but they only cater to 100k USD and above.Please help me recover this tokens are atleast freeze it

After some searches on r/NEO, I found a tool that does just that: https://github.com/snowypowers/ansy/releases (It runs offline, so it should be safe since your private key does not leave your computer.) Since I didn't see this mentioned here and since it gave me a bit of a headache, I thought I'd share.

How to use:

1. [Download the zip file.](https://github.com/snowypowers/ansy/releases) Version 2.0.0 worked for me. (2.0.1 didn't display the UI for some reason...)
1. Unzip the archive and open index.html with your favourite browser.
1. Make sure to select ""Convert"" (not ""Generate"").
1. Type your encrypted private key into the ""Private Key"" field
1. Optionally, type your public address into the ""Address (Optional)"" field.
1. Type your passphrase into the ""Password (Optional)"" field.
1. Click ""Convert"". Both the WIF private key (52 chars) and the hex private key (64 chars) are displayed. I think you can use either in ONTO, but I know that WIF works for sure.

Finally, a note of caution. **You should never put your private key into a tool without understanding what you're doing!** This is how people get phised. Don't take my word that this thing is safe to use, check for yourself: search what others have to say about the tool, look at the code if you're comfortable doing that, test it with another private key that doesn't hold anything of value first and check with your browser's developer console (F12 should open it) that it doesn't send any network requests.

The weird thing is that it doesn't generate any ONG (I first opened the ONTO wallet 3 days ago). So I can't send anything out. The balance for ONG still shows: 0.00000000000.

I bought some ONT today, 11 Jul 2018, they are now on the exchange,

from what i read, after 30 Jun 2018-mainnet launched, we don't have to do the mapping and setup the ONT ID ...

In summary, i don't need to do anything if i bought my ONT after 30 Jun 2018, am i correct ? all the ONT coins on all exchanges now must be the native mainnet coins and we just need to get them straight to our wallet once the wallets are ready in August 2018

Now about storing the ONT coins , other than the ONTO for android, or leave it on the exchange to wait for the Windows/IOS wallets, what do you guys do now if you dont want to leave them on the exchange ?",NA,"8xz6tu",NA,0,NA,"false",1536587880,"false","self","t5_4blrv","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/OntologyNetwork/comments/8xz6tu/bought_ont_today_11_jul_2018/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

First, the Ontology Mainnet is the core Ledger of Ontology, therefore just a part of Ontology?  

Second, does multichain mean many companies have their own chain and link them to Ontology Mainnet with modules? 

Third, what role takes the token ong in this ecosystem? On neo one uses gas for register assets or transaction fees, but ong @ Ontology?  

Fourth, are there chains yet which can be linked to Ontology? Does Zeepin, Deepbrainchain or other Neo ICOs use some aspects of Ontology? Can they be linked to Ontology with certain modules if they are complete seperate chains?

At the moment I holding them as ONT tokens in the NEON app and I am using a Mac and a Nano S. I have downloaded the latest ONTO app and I am following the instructions at [https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/mainnet-ont-token-swap-notice-%E5%85%B3%E4%BA%8Eont%E4%B8%BB%E7%BD%91%E5%88%87%E6%8D%A2%E7%9A%84%E8%AF%B4%E6%98%8E-4cd38c2fc55b](https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/mainnet-ont-token-swap-notice-%E5%85%B3%E4%BA%8Eont%E4%B8%BB%E7%BD%91%E5%88%87%E6%8D%A2%E7%9A%84%E8%AF%B4%E6%98%8E-4cd38c2fc55b) but they don't make sense, as I cannot even create an ID without funds in there.

​

If you can help, my questions are as follows:

1. What is the best method for transferring my tokens to mainnet under the conditions I describe above (Neon on Mac and Nano S)?
2. How do I then manage the second airdrop?

Thanks if you can help!

(and sorry if these questions have been asked plenty already, but I couldn't find clear answers in previous posts)

​

EDIT: I see in the ONTO FAQ that there may be the solution. Going to try it now, ie. create a burner account (as someone suggested in a previous post) and send the tokens to that address to swap, before sending to NanoS address finally. Will keep you posted.

​

EDIT 2: I have sent 2 ONT to the burner wallet and initiated swap. If that works, I'll send the rest. Perseverance!

Edit 3: It’s been about 20 hours since I initiated the swap, so should arrive in next couple of hours. Btw i would say it isn’t necessary to go through the ID process if this works. OK, it worked! Now to transfer to NanoS wallet.

- RPC interface: Can interact with the Ontology blockchain, including querying and sending transactions.
- Wallet: Can manage wallet file and stores the encrypted private key of the asset account and identity.
- Asset: Can transfer ONT/ONG, check account balance, withdraw ONT/ONG, and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

Looks like I have made two faux pas on a same day, both to do with ONT transfers.

I have been using Neon Wallet with Ledger Nano S for months. I have kept there both my NEO and ONT tokens.

Today I have decided to increase my position in ONT therefore I have bought some and transferred from Binance to my Neon Wallet (as I have several times before). I did not realise that ONT is kept on separate blockchain now. Would be good if Binance would stop such transfer but never mind. I have then transferred out my remaining ONT tokens (stored in Neon Wallet) to OWallet and these are gone as well.

&amp;#x200B;

So just to recap, I have following issues:

&amp;#x200B;

1)  ONT tokens transferred from Binance to Neon Wallet are gone (I can see them using [https://explorer.ont.io/address/](https://explorer.ont.io/address/))

2) ONT tokens transferred from Neon Wallet to new OWallet are gone (I cannot see them using [https://explorer.ont.io/address/](https://explorer.ont.io/address/)). I can see that transaction using https://neotracker.io/tx/. It went from my NEO account (which held NEO, GAS and ONT) to my ONT Address created earlier on today when logging to OWallet for the first time. Perhaps it will show up automatically in my OWallet with some delay (its been few hours already)?!?

&amp;#x200B;

I have only ever used Ledger Nano S to use both Wallets.

Can someone please help me or point me where to ask for help?!?",NA,"9af4dr",NA,0,NA,"false",1536808997,"false","self","t5_4blrv","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/OntologyNetwork/comments/9af4dr/ont_missing_transferring_to_both_neon_and_owallet/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

The sources have revealed that Ontology has partnered with Infinito wallet that has the capacity to support Mainnet ONT and ONG coins. The sources further revealed that these facilities will gear up by November of this year being the part of the roadmap.

**The Infinito Wallet is basically the world’s leading brands among crypto wallet that provides a proper mechanism for the crypto users and traders to maximize the use and power of the** **cryptocurrencies****.**

&amp;#x200B;

It is truly said that hard work pays off as the expert team of the said wallet has proved by actively embracing leading cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Litecoin, GAS, Dash, ETC, and Dogecoin.

In addition, the wallet also assists token namely ETH ERC2 and NEO NEP-5 standards. Nevertheless, the wallet will soon join Ontology.

Ontology is the power bank of services that enable high-performance speed, one of the most trusted platforms for collaboration, innovative projects, systematic strategies, protocols, modules and most importantly a good working environment with advanced infrastructure.

The interested users can download the Infinito wallet app from the play store app or app store in case of iPhone. The wallet mainly intends to create the ecosystem of active and practical blockchains services along with KYC/ ID source as well as services imparted by other blockchain businesses.

Moreover, the platform aims to show their active support to the community in developing the blockchain technologies and the related services. Thus, allowing the blockchain’s platform to build, explore, enhance innovative techniques and assets.

The expert team of Infinito wallet consists of 70 members including the market executives, developers, designers and so far.

**It’s a treat for the Ontology to have a partnership with Infinito wallet as it is the only wallet in the community that is part of the Infinity Blockchain Labs in Europe.**

The noting point is that both the platforms ‘Ontology and Infinito Wallet’ have their own specialty that will definitely give a new level to ONT as well as the wallet. The enthusiast and the user of Ontology are requested to stay tuned for latest updates.

I was not aware of the ONT token swap. So, I sent the ONT I bought yesterday on Binance to my NEON wallet like I usually do. When they did not show up that's when I found out about the swap.

1 - Command-Q doesn't work to quit the app, and there's no way to quit from the only two menu options. Luckily you can quit by right-clicking on the dock icon, but there should be at the least Command-Q functionality.


2 - The app doesn't log you out of your wallet. I entered a password while creating an individual wallet, but after quitting the app and re-opening I'm automatically logged into my wallet. I expected it to be like NEON where you need to enter you password each time. Seems like it's much safer that way with the added login.

**Q: Can I transfer ONT to exchanges after I have completed the token swap?**

A: Please do not transfer straightaway to exchanges after the successful completion of token swap on ONTO or other wallets. You first need to double check in with your exchanges if they have completed token swap and if they support MainNet ONT deposits. After confirming you can deposit to the exchange.

**Q: Can I send MainNet ONT to an exchange?**

A: Do not send MainNet ONT to an exchange until the exchange has announced they have opened support for MainNet ONT deposits.

**Q: Which exchanges support the MainNet ONT token swap?**

A: Binance, Huobi, KuCoin, OKEx, and CoinEgg have officially announced their support for the ONT MainNet token swap (info correct as of July 1st, 2018). We will update this answer if there are any changes known to us.

**Q: Do I have to do anything to complete the MainNet ONT token swap on exchanges?**

A: Please follow instructions on supporting exchanges on how to complete the MainNet ONT token swap.

**Q: When do I have to send my tokens to the exchanges?**

A: Please follow instructions on supporting exchanges on how to complete the MainNet ONT token swap.

**Q: Will I get my ONG if I keep my ONT on exchanges?**

A: Binance has announced that they will be distributing ONG to ONT holders monthly (info correct as of July 1st, 2018). We will update this answer if there are any changes known to us.

**ONTO**

**Q: How can I create an ONTO wallet?**

A: You can use your NEO wallet private key or WIF on ONTO to obtain your MainNet ONT. On ONTO use the “Import a wallet” function. Enter your NEO wallet private key or WIF, create a password, and after you have created your wallet your MainNet ONT will be in your wallet.

**Q: Do I need both my private key and WIF to do the manual swap?**

A: You only need either use your private key or WIF to complete the token swap.

**Q: How long do I have to wait for my NEP-5 ONT to swap to MainNet ONT?**

A: The MainNet ONT token swap will take up to 24 hours.

**Q: How can I check the status of the swap?**

A: You will be able to go to the swap status check page ([https://swap.ont.io](https://swap.ont.io)) to check the status of your MainNet ONT token swap. You can enter your ONT wallet address to check the status. The mapping status will show the amount and status (waiting processing, currently processing, complete). Alternatively, you can go to the official Ontology block explorer ([https://explorer.ont.io/](https://explorer.ont.io/)) and enter your ONT address to check your mapping information.

**Q: Will I receive ONG after the token swap?**

A: Your ONT will start generating ONG after your token swap is complete, and you will automatically receive ONG your ONT has generated since the beginning of the Ontology MainNet.

**Q: Are there fees for claiming ONG?**

A: There is a 0.01 ONG fee for claiming ONG.

**Q: After token swap completed, where should I store my ONT/ONG? Can I continue to save it in my current NEO wallet?**

A: You can store your MainNet ONT in ONTO or O3.

**General**

**Q: Is there a deadline for the token swap?**

A: Users will have until October 1st, 2018 to complete the swap.

**Q: What happens if I don’t complete the MainNet ONT token swap before the deadline?**

A: If ONT is not swapped before the token swap deadline it will remain on the NEO blockchain and not be able to be transferred to the Ontology MainNet.

**Q: Will MainNet ONT be divisible?**

A: MainNet ONT is indivisible (the smallest unit is 1 ONT). If your NEP-5 ONT amount is not a whole number you can buy (or sell) some to round the number up (or down) before performing the ONT MainNet token swap.

**Q: How can Ledger users do the token swap?**

A: Since Ledger does not support private key extraction, we recommend Ledger users complete mapping via ONTO or an exchange. However, ONTO’s desktop version, scheduled for August, will have functions for Ledger users to complete the token swap and claim their NEO Council ONT airdrop second half by using their mnemonic phrase.",NA,"97fd33",NA,0,NA,"false",1536757519,"false","self","t5_4blrv","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/OntologyNetwork/comments/97fd33/ont_token_swap_summary/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

As I was away for I while I haven't done so yet, and I missed out on a lot of info. Regarding this I have two questions:

1. Can I send it to an exchange? I read that it might create an issue as the tokenswap already happened. (I'm not planning on keeping my ONT for now, so I want it to be tradeable)
2. I never received the other half of my ONT, I never got the second distribution. Anyone else have this issue? SHould I have done something to receive it, or to be able to see it in my wallet?

Maybe I fucked up already, fortunately it's not about a lot of ONT, I just need to know what steps to take now to move my ONT from NEON wallet safely (if still possible). I can't seem to find the exact info I seek on reddit or the web, hope to find some answers here. All input is welcome!

1. Sell your ONT for BTC or ETH.
2. Transfer the BTC/ETH to Binance or another exchange w/ their stuff together.
3. Buy ONT on Binance/another exchange.

It sounds and is so simple but some of us relative noobs get so angry after seeing the red ""Withdrawals Not Allowed"" in KuCoin that we forget that we can still sell the locked up ONT and transfer the BTC/ETH to Binance and buy. What's more, as the spread on KuCoin for ONT is crazy, you might even be able to garner a few extra ONT via arbitrage. Definitely worth a try if you're frustrated with KuCoin's ONT lockup.

Look, before you try sending and coin swapping on your own based off of something you might have read, skim through the page. We don’t need daily “what have I done?!” threads. Well, maybe we do but they shouldn’t be this frequent. 

I don’t like seeing all the panic, I’ve had that before. By now there are enough examples and posts of what to do and how to do it correctly that I hope you all take the time before rushing into swapping! It’s all new and kinks will work out. Maybe an ONG faucet if anyone feels like it would be a good idea? I just don’t know how much has been claimed already.

For me I bought in at $3 a little while ago and binance has withdrawals frozen until MainNet was all figured out, and then they also distributed ONG so that all went smoothing.  Lucky I guess. 

Soon enough ONG will be on more exchanges. Right now just CoinMex and I’ve sold some there. It’s going for like $1 right now which is pretty crazy. I’m glad to see that there is a lot of support here too as well with people sending gas to others. 

Anyway, stay safe and if we could just have a sort of one stop shop discussion here that would be cool too.

&amp;#x200B;

Somehow I managed to end up with a non-round number of NEP-5 ONT (0.9972552 to be exact) that I cannot swap to the mainnet due to the whole number restrictions.  So basically I am short  0.0027448 ONT (0.6 US cents worth).  I can't buy or send that much from any exchange as far as I know, so I was wondering if someone with a very low decimal amount of their own dust would be willing to send me enough to get to 1.  I'd be happy to send back the ONG needed for the transaction (plus some more to make it worth your while).

&amp;#x200B;

It would be great to get some sort of trading marketplace to people to match up and clean up their indivisible dust which would be useful otherwise.

&amp;#x200B;

Unless you guys know of another way to clean up NEP-5 dust.

See my post here to see what problems I had: https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/comments/9fkuaq/ont_token_swap_with_ledger_nano_s_i_guess_i/?

Use the website https://coranos.github.io/neo/ledger-nano-s/recovery/ **For security reasons download it to your local hardrive and disconnect from the internet or use it on an offline computer.**

Enter your Ledger Nano S Seed Words seperated with spaces in the field “BIP39 Mnemonic”. **Change Coin from 888’ (NEO) to 1024’ (ONT).**

Click “Find WIF”

It should look like this after: https://imgur.com/a/mIg39hH (The seed words are just an example :-))

After that you will see many Addresses with their private keys. For me the first one was the right Address.

With the private key you can unlock your wallet with “add wallet” in O3 Desktop and make the token swap.

&amp;#x200B;

im new to ONT and to Neo and i have a few question in my mind. 

1. When all ONG got distributed by holding ONT why would i continue to hold ONT?
2. Is the only usecase of ONT to hold to produce ONG? 
3. When i make transactions i need to pay ONG. Who receives those ONG? The seed nodes? 

I have those same Question for NEO 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for your answers :)

Thanks for any help!

Edit: In this support topic in the O3 Board others also have this problem: https://community.o3.network/t/cannot-unlock-wallet/844/16 
A solution ccould be to use a BIP39 Tool to get the private key for ONT from our ledger like it can be done for NEO: https://coranos.github.io/neo/ledger-nano-s/recovery/ But I do not know how you can do it with ONT.

just swapped \~28ONT to receive \~0.5 ONG.   That equates to about $60 USD to about 50 cents worth of a swap (given value of ONT is \~$2, and ONG is \~80cents).   So the swap kinda seems worthless from that perspective.

&amp;#x200B;

My question though:  will the ONT tokens still remain active on October 1st?   Or will it only be the ONG main net tokens that are active?  Basically I'm wondering if I should just sell my ONT to then buy ONG.

Interestingly the 2nd half of my ONT airdrop wasn't visible as NEP-5 token in my NEON wallet to begin with. It also isn't visible on the Neontracker (besides 0,5 ONT which I donated to 03) - but under my address *removed* I can see it on the ONT explorer. 

In the O3 wallet (under the mentioned address) there is no option for a NEP-5 token swap - just ""main net"". Am I right to assume that I don't need to swap anything anymore because it's already on the ONT mainnet?

Who can send me 0,01 Ong to get started? I'll send 0,02 Ong gladly back to you. Address as mentioned!

Hi everyone!

I've been waiting for almost 1 h for 10 ONT transfer from O3 mobile wallet to OWallet. I can see the transaction as ""Pending"" in the O3 transaction tracker but I was wondering for how long it's going to be there.

Does anyone know how long this kind of transfers take? Is the blockchain delayed maybe?

Thanks!

I finally realized that I had to get my first air drop of ONT on the main net. I read that you could import your wallet into O Wallet and use your private key/password.

I wasn't a fan of this idea as I hold a lot more NEO than ONT and felt uncomfortable giving this information out. I found out I could create a new wallet on the O Wallet and transferred my first airdrop there and did the swap feature.

This worked fine except now I realized the new O Wallet knows nothing about my 2nd air drop of ONT since its linked to my NEO address.

Is there any other way to claim the 2nd airdrop in lieu of importing my NEON wallet with sensitive information? Is it safe to give that information out to O Wallet?

Another idea was to create a new wallet in NEON, move my assets into there so my original one is empty and then can import that into O Wallet.

I downloaded OWallet and used lastpass to generate a massive password and create a wallet, then moved it from Neon. Stupidly, when I copied the OWallet address, I over wrote the copied and pasted last pass password without saving it (just so used to it saving automatically but still, stupid).

I have the dat file and I have OWallet open so I can see that it's there, is there anyway I can regenerate the wallet and create a new password? When I choose import the dat file it asks for the password and if I try to use private key it asks for a 52 bit WIF. The file says it has a private key which is 64 bit so this throws an error. The key is some data and then a + sign and a bunch more, if I delete the stuff before the + it's 52 characters long but this still doesn't work.

I'm not gonna cry over it if it's lost as it genuinely is hardly any but still, if I could save it that'd be great.

""The current ownership of ONT is the highest concentrated ownership of any token that DAR has examined. Moreover, DAR discovered that the project has released 19.1M more tokens to institutional partners than what the project has previously reported. Still, only 120.1M ONT has been distributed to the community, far less than the 538M tokens that have been unlocked.

There is debate within the cryptocurrency community regarding the measurement and definition of the circulating supply of ONT tokens. Our research shows that how this supply is defined and measured is inconsistent across public sources and ranges from 151M ONT to 538M ONT.”
