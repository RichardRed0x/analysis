I understand sharding allows multiple blocks to be validated in parallel. Completed blocks are then added to the mutual (central) blockchain. 

Is it that whichever block is deciphered and validated first, is added to the mutual blockchain? So it's all chronological, but it's just that multiple blocks are being worked on?

On BTC, many miners work on a block and the winner gets the reward, meaning inefficient use of the other miner's computational resource and effort. With sharding, does this now mean miner power is spread to become more efficient, or doesn't that matter because of some other concept coming into play (PoW vs Proof of stake)?

Correct me where I'm wrong:

- The supply is 12.6 billion ZIL. There's mention of [""The tokens in Group 3 are mostly vested for 3 years""](https://blog.zilliqa.com/more-details-on-zilliqas-token-generation-event-4e1b78e0cf5a) - but ""mostly"" doesn't give a lot of information, 3 years isn't much time anyway.

- A lot of that 12.6 billion ZIL have already been sold OTC to crypto hedge funds, which for some reason appear on their website at partners - those aren't some great partners to have. You won't see a serious foundation like Ethereum anouncing hedge funds that bought tokens as partners.

- The project is run by a for-profit company, not by a foundation.

- The for-profit company gets 10% of the ZIL supply. Another 12% goes to a research foundation with many common members with the company. Another 5% goes to some specific persons from that company. 3% (0.63 billion) to various agencies and advisors. That's a lot, because you have to remember that much of the money raised from the 30% community round went to that company as well.

- Smart contracts aren't implemented yet.

- State sharding is not in the 12-months roadmap.

- Only 3 developers on the team page; this seems true because there are only three important contributors on GitHub https://github.com/Zilliqa/Zilliqa/graphs/contributors.

- Huge competition, one of which might already be at the point of no return, unbeatable. I'm talking about Ethereum of course.

- Irrelevant marketing and media presence.

- No mainstream visibility, after all... we only buy tokens on the Ethereum network. There's no developer using the Zilliqa network for anything, anytime soon.

- Not lead by a business-oriented CEO (for example like Cardano).

- It still uses PoW for some stuff.

- They launch in the same time as EOS, but they don't beat its TX throughput.

I'm new to blockchain and trying to understand what Zilliqa is offering as part of it's sharding solution.'

Ethereum has also proposed sharding as an upcoming solution. 
https://www.coindesk.com/vitalik-first-part-ethereums-sharding-roadmap-nearly-done/

How do you think this would compare and compete with what Zilliqa has to offer? If ethereum sharding was successful would that mean the inclination for new ico's/projects to stay on etherueum would be strong?.. or is there any other incentive to moving towards Zilliqa?

appreciate your answers.

Think again (opinion and discussion)","Zilliqa is a protocol type of project with huge potential, I want to talk about my perspective only in terms of market capitalization, which is the most important indicator to understand prices.

At current levels of $0.079 with a circulating supply of ~6.2bn that results in a market cap of 489,800,000 USD

Now let's look at what the market offers at that market cap range:

50	Dragonchain	$601,836,582  
59	Kyber Network	$489,195,359  
68	Aion	$392,527,256  

This is a project that has been developed since 2015, not a project that recently began.

I think this has at least a position on the top 35 (&gt; $1bn market cap), comparing its potential to other academic projects like Cardano ($16bn) you can really see where this will head eventually.

If you aren't convinced to invest, think once, if you hodl and want to sell now, think twice.

I believe Zilliqa is unfairly being tagged as overprice, but people are not considering the fact that the market already has projects which are at similar levels of development and close or over to $1bn (EOS, Tezos, Rchain).

What market cap range do you think ZIL should be at?

2. If i do not need ETH in huobipro to pay for GAS when buy Zil in huobipro, does it mean that i can transfer bitcoin from elsewhere into huobipro and sell the BTC for ZIL? then how will the transaction fee be deducted? in terms of ZIL or in terms of BTC? 

3. Suppose its now a few months later in 2018 and i have ZIL stored in Myetherwallet. And i want to sell my ZIL. Do i need some ether in that same Myetherwallet address, to pay for GAS so that i can send the ZIL back to huobipro to sell the ZIL? (this is related to question 1)

&amp;nbsp;

* Likely to be the first project that will implement sharding, addressing the need for scalability


* Unlike most other scalability projects that claim they will have thousands of transactions per second, Zilliqa is fully permissionless (anyone can join the network) as opposed to dPOS projects which rely on validators

* Some Ethereum dApps may switch to Zilliqa if it’s a better fit for them (think multiples of Cryptokitties' amounts of transactions)
 
* **Strong team**, they know their stuff, very strong academic background (check out those publications below!), communicate professionally, listen to the community

* Publications of the CEO Xinshu Dong: https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=kYzU2AkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en
* Prateek Saxena, Chief Scientific Advisor (this guy is the professor of Loi Luu, CEO &amp; Co-founder of kyber.network, see below): ​https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~prateeks/ 
* Yaoqi JIA, Blockchain Architect: https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~jiayaoqi/
* Amrit Kumar, Crypto Lead: https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~amrit/
* Loi Luu, Advisor, CEO &amp; Co-founder of kyber.network: https://comp.nus.edu.sg/~loiluu/
* DYOR: https://www.zilliqa.com/team.html These guys are academic professionals. 

* Mining consumes less power, more equitable mining rewards


* Partnership with Mindshare, large ad agency that is planning to use their blockchain to test various solutions for problems they are facing.

* Modest raise for a project of this scope


* FGB and Deep Brain partnerships could push Zilliqa’s profile in Asian markets


* New blockchains are doing amazingly well. Comparable with ICON, Wanchain, EOS etc.: Zilliqa is a third generation blockchain. 


* Will have privacy and cross-chain features in the future. Amrit even published a paper about the traceability of Monero, which spurred discussion about the topic and resulted in proposals for fixes (Warning, PDF! : https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~amrit/papers/monero-analysis.pdf)

&amp;nbsp;

Neutral:

* Programming language for smart contracts will be data flow based, non-Turing complete. May limit the type of possible dApps.

&amp;nbsp;

Negative:

* Zilliqa’s sharding has the drawback that running a full node means terabytes of data are required. They want to mitigate this by partnering with blockchain distributed storage providers such as Genaro or Bluzelle.

I'm looking to get some ZIL but the current price is incredibly high. From what I gather, the price is ~35x that of the ICO, accounting for ETHs rise I know that it's less than this on the ratio, but still significant. 

In addition, most of the tokens were sold prior to the ICO at an even cheaper price... I don't know how much this discount was (would be great if someone could fill me in). 

I've made the mistake before of FOMO'ing into a coin straight off the BAT ($0.28 bag holder) where only a handful of people got into the ICO, inflating the price upon listing... so i'm trying to avoid doing it again with ZIL. 

So... for all of you who are waiting on the sidelines, and more experienced with post-ICO price movement: **What is your entry point?**

""We have set the cap for our contributors to 48,889 ETH, or US$22mm at a locked rate of US$450 USD/ETH.""

and...

""The formula to calculate the price is 21,000,000,000 * 30% / (48,889 + Total_Bonus).

For illustration, if we receive the maximum of 44,444 ETH from early contributors then their bonus tokens (at 10.0%–15.0%) will correspond to 4,444.4–6,666.6 ETH. If we also receive the maximum 4,445 ETH from our community contribution round then the denominator in the formula will be 53,333.4- 55,555.6, resulting in a ZIL price between 118,124 ZIL/ETH and 113,399 ZIL/ETH.""

So...

At the locked rate of USD 450 / 1 ETH, you get between USD 0.0038 and 0.0040.

At the current rate of USD 990 / 1 ETH, you get between USD 0.0084 and 0.0087.

The price of USD 0.099 seems to be circulating a lot around here.

USD 0.0099 was calculated at the rate of (roughly) USD 1150 / 1 ETH a couple of weeks ago.

At the time of purchase, if investors went straight from USD to ETH to ZIL, they paid between USD 0.0038 and 0.0040. Not USD 0.0099.

Neither am I a financial advisor, nor is this meant to be financial advice. Whatever follows, just reflects my understanding of the project, and my personal opinion on its future outlook.*

Recently we have seen a lot of debate surrounding scalability of public blockchains, partly stemming from the [CryptoKitties fiasco](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42237162). [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/) is an online game, created by Vancouver-based Axiom Zen, that allows users to purchase, trade, and breed digital kittens. Soon after its public release on November 28, the game took the cryptocurrency world by surprise, accounting for about 11% of total transactions on the [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) network, the blockchain that the CryptoKitties application is built on. The volume of traffic on the platform within the first week of its release was enough to put serious strain on the Ethereum blockchain, clogging the network, causing significantly slower transactions times and higher transaction costs for all the blockchain users.

Some may argue that having an application like Cryptokitties on the Blockchain is frivolous, since the application is a non-coin related gaming platform. However, I think that this is a great application of the Blockchain technology, and why the technology is so disruptive. In fact Ethereum Co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, himself [tweeted](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/937628849084309504) in support of the application, emphasizing on the value that the blockchain technology brings.

So, maybe instead of asking the question: *‘Should we have an application like CryptoKitties on a public blockchain?’*, we should really be asking the question: *‘Shouldn’t public blockchains be more scalable to real world application?’*. The fact is that, **as of today, blockchains are limited in their ability to scale**, which some argue is the biggest technological barrier to global adoption of the technology.


**WHAT LIMITS SCALABILITY OF BLOCKCHAINS?**


Consensus protocols on existing public blockchains (Ethereum, Bitcoin, Neo, Ripple etc.) have a critical requirement for validation of transactions: **every participating node on the network has to validate each transaction sequentially, and then store transactions on the ledger, a copy of which is maintained by each node.** This requirement is what imparts, to blockchains, their key characteristic —*‘decentralization’*.

However, in such a decentralized system, as the number of transactions on the network increases (with, for example, blockchain adoption), the need for additional nodes, to process and store transactions, also increases. As the number of nodes on the network increases, the data for each transaction has to travel a lot more before being validated and stored by ALL the nodes on the network. Therefore, the network does not scale well as more nodes are added to the network due to the inter-node latency that increases logarithmically with each additional node. In effect, **blockchain scalability reduces as the network size increases.**

Public blockchain consensus protocols, that operate in this fashion, are forced to choose decentralization over high transaction throughput.

Today, approximately 900 distributed applications (dApps) are built on the Ethereum Network. With a transaction throughput of about 15 transactions-per-second (tx/s), Ethereum is barely capable of handling the current transaction volume, and would have to scale significantly to be able to handle the expected transaction volume in the near future. The Bitcoin network is even worse in terms of transaction throughput, processing only about 4 to 7 tx/s. Similar is the story for all the existing public blockchain platforms, with some being slightly more scalable than others, but all glaring into a future where **blockchain transaction throughput could be a severe bottleneck, hindering mass adoption of the blockchain technology.**

Researchers from the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](http://www.nus.edu.sg/) have founded a blockchain startup called **[Zilliqa]**(https://www.zilliqa.com/). This new blockchain uses the *‘sharding’* technology, that is set to achieve Visa and MasterCard level transaction throughput of about 4000 tx/s.


**HOW IS ZILLIQA A GAME-CHANGER IN THE DOMAIN OF PUBLIC BLOCKCHAINS**


Zilliqa is a high-throughput public blockchain platform designed to scale to thousands of transactions per second. The reasons, I believe, Zilliqa stands out as a public blockchain platform suitable for global adoption are as follows:

* **Zilliqa is linearly scalable.** Linear scalability means that as the number of participating nodes in the network increases, the transaction throughput also increases at an almost linear rate. Although it may sound intuitive, the fact is that, for most blockchains, the opposite is actually true, i.e. as the number of participating nodes in the network increases, each transaction now has to be broadcasted to a greater number of nodes before being validated and added to the ledger, thereby limiting transaction throughput. This is the reason why many solutions to increase transaction throughput depend on restricting the number of participating nodes on the network, which comes at the cost of a reduced degree of decentralization.

* **Zilliqa is the first public blockchain to implement sharding.** Sharding is a concept that has existed for distributed systems for a long time, where it is used to improve scalability, performance, and I/O bandwidth. However, the concept has not yet been implemented on any public blockchain. Sharding is the process of automatic splitting of a network of nodes into parallel chains called ‘shards’, where each shard processes a small portion of all transactions in conjunction with other shards, resulting in a microblock from each shard. These micro-blocks are then merged into one complete block that is added to the blockchain. Zilliqa is now leading the way in implementing this automatic network parallelization for public blockchains.

* **In October 2017, running with 3600 nodes and 6 shards, Zilliqa has already recorded a peak throughput of 2488 tx/s on its internal testnet.** This is already about 250 times higher throughput than Ethereum. With the first version of Zilliqa’s public mainnet scheduled for Q2 2018, this is a remarkable feat, and goes to show how Zilliqa is well on track to make the blockchain technology practical for high throughput applications, and hence global adoption.

* **Zilliqa uses Proof-of-Work (PoW) just to establish mining identities, and not as a consensus protocol, thereby significantly reducing the overall energy footprint.** This is fundamentally different from other PoW blockchains, like Bitcoin, where PoW is performed to mine every block, making the mining process energy intensive.

* **Zilliqa uses an optimized practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant (pBFT) consensus protocol which gives finality to transactions.** In other words, unlike PoW-based consensus, where multiple confirmations are required, pBFT does not allow temporary forks due to the consensus protocol, i.e. once a block gets committed to the blockchain, no other block can share the same parent as the committed block. As a result, no confirmations are required.

* **Zilliqa’s pBFT based consensus allows for efficient management of storage requirements.** Because of finality, the entire transaction history does not have to be saved on the blockchain. Instead it is sufficient to store only the latest state. With smart contracts, however, the storage requirements increase significantly. But Zilliqa is exploring collaboration opportunities with distributed cloud storage networks such as Bluzelle and Genaro Network, to be able to utilize their storage for storing blocks and fetching them, when needed, for the execution of smart contracts.

* **Zilliqa’s smart contract language is easier to reason and less prone to bugs.** Unlike Ethereum, Zilliqa’s smart contract language is not Turing complete, and instead it uses a non-Turing complete language, which makes it simpler, easy to understand, and more receptive to formal methods-based verification.

* **Zilliqa is the only blockchain protocol that is truly scalable without sacrificing security or decentralization.** There are other blockchain protocols that claim to have higher transaction throughput, but they achieve this, either by restricting the number of participating nodes on the network, thereby increasing the degree of centralization, or by making the blockchain more vulnerable to attacks, and hence reducing the security of the blockchain.


**HOW DOES ZILLIQA COMPARE AGAINST ITS 'COMPETITORS'?**


Although Zilliqa’s team does not see the other existing public blockchains as competitors, and rather takes a more open approach towards them, facilitating a healthy environment of learning from each project and developing on it, I use the term ‘competitors’ here in the conventional sense to be able to compare Zilliqa head-to-head against the existing blockchains. The following comparisons are based on the information shared by Zilliqa’s team with the community.


**Zilliqa versus [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/):**

* Bitcoin network processes about 4 to 7 tx/s, whereas **Zilliqa has already processed about 500 times more transactions per second** on its testnet.
* Since Bitcoin uses PoW as a consensus protocol, it applies PoW on each block, making mining of blocks much more energy intensive. Zilliqa, on the other hand, uses pBFT as a consensus protocol, with PoW just being applied for miner identification. Therefore, **the high energy costs associated with PoW will not apply in Zilliqa.**
* Unlike Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism, **Zilliqa’s pBFT gives finality to transactions**, requiring no confirmations, which significantly reduces the storage requirements.
* Unlike Bitcoin, **Zilliqa has smart contract functionality** and it supports the building of dApps on its platform.


**Zilliqa versus [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/):**

* Ethereum network processes about 10 to 12 tx/s, whereas **Zilliqa’s transaction throughput is already about 250 times higher.**
* Just like Bitcoin, Ethereum also uses PoW as its consensus protocol. Therefore **Zilliqa’s pBFT consensus protocol makes it much more energy efficient.**
* Ethereum’s PoW-based consensus does not protect it against temporary forks, and hence requires a certain number of confirmations before the block is committed. However, **Zilliqa’s pBFT gives finality to transactions,** requiring no confirmations, which significantly reduces the storage requirements.
* Unlike Ethereum, **Zilliqa uses a non-Turing complete language for smart contracts,** making it less prone to bugs, and more receptive to formal methods-based verification.
* Ethereum is still exploring Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and sharding as alternatives to improve scalability. However, Zilliqa has already chosen, and implemented sharding as its approach towards solving blockchain scalability constraints, possibly allowing it to run high throughput applications long before Ethereum. **Zilliqa has the first mover advantage in the arena of truly scalable blockchains.**


**Zilliqa versus [NEO](https://neo.org/):**

* As a consensus protocol, NEO uses delegated BFT (dBFT) that requires a sub-set of nodes, called book-keeping nodes, to run consensus on behalf of the entire network. These book-keeping nodes are also required to deposit and lock a sufficiently large collateral. The disadvantage of this approach is that if the number of book-keeping nodes is too large, it significantly reduces the liquidity from the market due to the locking up of a large collateral; and if the number of book-keeping nodes is too small, it reduces the degree of decentralization of the blockchain, making it less secure from attacks. On the other hand, Zilliqa uses pBFT for consensus, with a significantly large number of nodes that are not required to lock up any collateral. Therefore, **Zilliqa’s consensus protocol reduces neither market liquidity, nor the degree of decentralization or security.**
* NEO deals with the challenge of scalability by running dBFT on a subset of the nodes, thereby reducing decentralization and security. Zilliqa solves the scalability challenge by using sharding the network and the transactions into parallel chains, each chain processing its own micro-block, to be merged into a final block. Thus, **Zilliqa is truly scalable, while maintaining decentralization and security.**


**Zilliqa versus [EOS](https://eos.io/):**

* EOS uses delegated PoS (dPoS) as its consensus protocol, where a subset of 21 nodes, called block producers, are used to propose blocks. This does yield a high throughput with scalability, but induces significant centralization and security risks for the network. **Zilliqa is scalable without compromising the decentralization or security of the blockchain.**
* **The dPoS of EOS does not guarantee transaction finality, the way Zilliqa’s pBFT does.**

**PROJECT ROADMAP**


The highlights of Zilliqa’s roadmap are as follows:
* Zilliqa has already released **public testnet v1.0**
* **Public testnet v1.5** release is scheduled for **Q1 2018**
* **Public mainnet** release is scheduled for **Q2 2018**
* **dApps** release scheduled for **Q3 2018**

Zilliqa has a very active roadmap ahead, with the biggest event being its mainnet launch.


**PRICE SPECULATION**


At the Token Generation Event (TGE), Zilliqa set the cap for contributors to 48,889 ETH, or **US$ 22 million** at a locked rate of US$ 450/ETH. Zilliqa’s tokens are called ‘Zillings’, or ZILs. **ZIL price at the TGE was US$ 0.003877**. Zilliqa has a finite supply of 21 billion tokens, of which only 60% (12.6 billion tokens) are generated at the TGE, and the remaining 40% (8.4 billion tokens) would be mining rewards over the next 10 years. The details on Zilliqa’s TGE can be found of [Zilliqa’s official blog post regarding TGE](https://blog.zilliqa.com/more-details-on-zilliqas-token-generation-event-4e1b78e0cf5a).

The market cap of Zilliqa has grown from about **US$ 22 million** at the TGE, to **US$ 49 million** as of this writing, due to the increase in ETH price. Zilliqa’s public mainnet release is scheduled for Q2 2018.
Considering the improvements Zilliqa’s public blockchain protocol adds to the technology in terms of performance, security and governance, and the experience and competence of the team behind the Zilliqa project, there is a huge upside on the price potential of ZIL.

In the short term, by the time Zilliqa’s public mainnet is released in Q2 2018, I think its market cap could easily be in the range of US$ 3 to 7 billion. With a circulating supply of 6.3 billion ZILs, this would mean ZIL price could be in the range of **US$ 0.5 to 1.1**, that is **roughly 12,000 to 28,000% increase (120x to 280x) from the ICO price in US$ terms.**

In the long-term, it is next to impossible to predict ZIL price with any considerable level of certainty, due to the sheer number of factors that could influence the growth and adoption Zilliqa’s public blockchain. Any attempts to make such predictions would be merely speculative, and should be considered so. However, it would be fair to say that for any public blockchain platform that is able to truly scale with global adoption, has a large developer community, is one of the preferred blockchains to host high throughput dApps, and does all of this in a decentralized and secure manner, having a market cap in excess of US$ 100 billion in the long-term would be a reasonable prospect.

**The bottom line is that, for Zilliqa, truly, sky is the limit.** And this is what makes Zilliqa’s future potential so exciting and worth keeping an eye on!

**Full disclosure:** I am invested in Zilliqa for the long-term, and I plan to buy more when Zilliqa trading goes live.

I also don't understand the whole idex balance, then you have to transfer it, to trade and buy. Does that mean it is safe to just keep it in idex?

Basically I have about 4000 ZIL on Huobi and I'm a little worried I need to withdraw. I just need a few questions answering.

1. Do I need ether in huobi for the fee of withdrawing.

2. Is it as simple of just withdrawing from huobi to my myetherwallet wallet address or do I have to go through some process of setting up a custom token.

3. Once I have withdrawn to myetherwallet what happens when the ZIL changes over to the native currency? Will it be safe?

4. If I was to then want to withdraw from my ether wallet to potentially sell my ZIL etc would I need eth in myetherwallet to complete the fee? If so how can I do this as my eth is tied up in Altcoin on binance and huobi whos minimum withdraw is 0.1 and I wouldn't want to potentially sell my coins at a loss to be able to transfer my ZIL back from myetherwallet. Could I purchase a small amount say £5 worth on coin base then send that to myetherwallet to cover fees?

5. If I need eth in myetherwallet to withdraw, What would happen if I tried withdrawing from my ether wallet with no eth in there. 

Again I'm a noob and I really appreciate any help anyone can give I'm sorry for asking so many. Thanks.

If so, I congratulate you. This is the most exciting project of 2018. Adoption for cryptocurrencies can only be achieved if technology works for mass adoption, and Zilliqa is the best project so far to achieve this.

It seems we don't have a realistic roadmap outside of the one posted here 5 months ago... 

""Jun 01, 2017: Project Zilliqa started

Aug 10, 2017: Whitepaper released

Sept 01, 2017: Experimental result release of internal testnet v0.1 (crypto, PoW, data layer, network sharding, consensus)

Oct 01, 2017: Experimental result release of internal testnet v0.5 (+ tx sharding &amp; processing, storage, incentives, new nodes joining)

Nov 15, 2017: Releasing design documentation on smart contracts, compiler, and app framework; Experimental result release of internal testnet v1.0 (resilience &amp; recover, wallet, optimizations)

Dec, 2017: Releasing public testnet v1.0 and source code (public miners can join and test, feedback &amp; bug fixes)

Feb, 2018: Releasing public testnet v1.5 (with basic smart contract support)

Mar, 2018: Releasing public testnet v2.0 (with computational sharding)

Q2, 2018: Launching Ziliqa public mainnet

Q3, 2018: Releasing dApps""

My question is : 

What version of the test net are we in now?  Someone in Telegram states 1.0, which would put us behind on this rough roadmap.

If it's V 1.5, I'll be a bit more at ease, but in the NEO Dev Con video he states : 

""In summer or autumn, maybe, we can release our Main Net""

Q2 is rapidly approaching.  

Do we have any other information on this?

Not trying to FUD, but want to be realistic here.  He doesn't seem very confident about a Q2, or even Q3 Main Net release in this video.

If we're in for a longer wait, maybe these calls to wait until 0.03-0.05 cents are warranted.  BTW - Coin Market Cap just updated.

Just trying to save those on the fence from the realistic possibility of bag-holding for 6 months.  It's happened to me, and it is not fun.

#Welcome!

*******

We warmly welcome everyone to r/zilliqa. Please protect this community's philosophy by respecting our rules (see sidebar or scroll down). 
We would like to highlight two key points:

- Keep price discussion and market talk to unofficial subreddits such as [r/ziltrader](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZILTrader/).
- Keep the discussion on this subreddit around Zilliqa's technology.

[Zilliqa] (https://www.zilliqa.com) is the first high-throughput public blockchain platform that implements sharding. Sharding ensures that the transaction throughput increases as the mining network expands. The platform is tailored towards enabling secure decentralized apps, designed to meet the scaling requirements of real-world applications. Zilliqa has been under research and development for two years. It has powered several ground-breaking deployments commercially to date. Tokens in Zilliqa are called ZIL.

It looks like the use of sharding in Zilliqa splits the transaction verification work, but not the bandwidth usage: at least the DS nodes still have to hear about all the blocks/transactions. And actually bandwidth usage seems to be much worse with the elaborate protocols in which every nodes has to hear about 2/3 of the other nodes in its shard. I thought the main scaling problem in e.g. bitcoin has to do more with bandwidth than with transaction processing, so is this really solving anything?

Zilliqa does not do state sharding, meaning each node stores the entire transaction history. Only big mining servers are able to accommodate data of this scale. There are two potential solutions I find Zilliqa team is proposing in the technical faq.
 &gt; Because of finality, the entire transaction history does not have to be saved on the blockchain. Instead it is sufficient to store only the latest state.

If a node only gets the latest state, how does it independently verify it’s valid? In Bitcoin and Ethereum, any node can download the entire history and replay all transactions ever happened since the genesis block, not depending on anybody else to verify its integrity.
&gt; We are currently in touch with distributed storage network platforms such as Bluzelle and Genaro to see how we can leverage their network for storage.

If we store data off chain, we have to trust a 3rd party, defeating the purpose of using a blockchain in the first place.

 2. amrit has a twitter handle that does not mention about his involvement in the project..what is his involvement at this point 


3. how competitive is their roadmap to plasma and casper release on ethereum? unless they move fast--they risk being second.

Along with the turbulent investment boom, the concept of cryptocurrency was deeply rooted in people's minds, but few projects actually landed on it. 

In 2018, as the underlying foundation for the promotion of many blockchain projects, the public chain has ushered in the outbreak period, and the landing project has emerged. Zilliqa, which is committed to **“creating a new generation of high-throughput blockchain platform”,** has adopted many projects. 

The characteristics of ""fast and safe"" appear. Zilliqa CEO Dong Xinshu:**“Zilliqa aims to solve the problem of scalability of public chains. The focus and difficulty of the project lies in the pursuit of speed while ensuring the decentralization and security of the entire chain. Zilliqa currently uses fragmentation technology to achieve Thousands of transactions per second, this divide-and-conquer approach helps improve network processing speed.""**

&amp;nbsp;

**Fragmentation Technology Divide and Rule to Solve the Problem of Public Chain Expansion**

As the bottom-line application of the development of blockchain, the public chain has always been concerned and favored by the industry. With the development of the project, problems associated with the public chain appear. Among them, the problem of scalability is particularly obvious. In the face of an increasingly large transaction scale and the establishment of future blockchain ecological projects, the throughput of the public chain has become a difficult problem for the development of the industry. In this context, Zilliqa's **""slicing technology""** has entered the people's field of vision.

**Zilliqa CEO Dong Xinshus said that Zilliqa is the world’s first public blockchain platform for scalability and security, supporting thousands of transactions per second. It is tailor-made for secure data-driven distributed applications to meet the requirements of large-scale, high-throughput applications such as digital advertising and electronic asset management.**

As we all know, Ethereum has previously proposed a fragmentation algorithm to improve scalability, and attempts to achieve a better balance among the three indicators of decentralization, scalability, and security. In response, Dong Xinshu pointed out: ""Slicing technology is the essence of Zilliqa maintaining high throughput, which is obviously different from the segmentation of Ethereum's plan. Ethereum is directly using stateful slicing. 

Zilliqa's slicing is on the Internet. Layers, transaction layers, and computational layers, but store the current final state at the storage layer or at all nodes.In simple terms, Zilliqa's sharding technology can circumvent some cross-slice communication and use other techniques to optimize the storage aspect. Top slicing technology divides a network node into many different parts. Different parts can handle different transactions. This forms a divide-and-conquer, parallel-processing situation. For the entire network, the transaction processing speed will be greatly increased. As nodes increase, fragmentation increases, throughput increases, and overall scalability is achieved.""

&amp;nbsp;

**Smart Contract Procedure Automatic Verification Ensures Network Security**

Zilliqa truly realizes the scalability of the main chain and efficient transaction processing. Zilliqa does not depend on centralized nodes to handle the fragmentation process while maintaining decentralized positioning and protecting system security. Dong Xinshu pointed out: **""For security reasons, Zilliqa uses a proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism to ensure the security and decentralization of the entire blockchain protocol.""**

Currently Zilliqa's initial network tests are targeted at some simple transactions, but when future blockchain applications are built on Zilliqa, they will inevitably encounter smart contract issues. According to the current Zilliqa's idea, there are corresponding security considerations for smart contracts. Dong Xinshu said: **""Today's smart contract construction has been very complicated, it is often difficult to verify its problems, and it is also difficult to judge whether it meets the various needs of the construction project. Given the complexity of smart contracts, unpredictable behavior and Without formal proof and other factors, Zilliqa has developed a smart contract language that ensures that the system will provide automatic verification when the user writes a smart contract program, which is a great improvement for security.""**

In addition, Dong Xinshu also stated: ""Zilliqa's security is based on the Byzantine assumption. All security guarantees are based on the cryptography level, and mathematical probabilities and cryptography can be used for inference analysis.""

&amp;nbsp;

**Strengthen application cooperation to promote the ecological improvement of the blockchain**

It is understood that Zilliqa has set a clear project development path and is currently implementing **""slicing friendly""** to promote the operation of the test network, adding more new features, conducting intensive testing and optimization, and regulating the details of smart contracts. 

It is expected that Q3 will release the main network in 2018 and Q4 will release decentralized applications in 2018. The future planning of Zilliqa is also reflected in three aspects: 

1. continuous research and development
1. support for decentralized applications requiring high throughput and high security
1. scientific research cooperation with the community.

With regard to the latest developments of the project, Dong Xinshu told Golden Finance that **“One of the current priorities of the project is to strengthen cooperation with applications. The first application of Zilliqa is to cooperate with Mindshare, a leading global media company. Solve the problems faced by the advertising industry and implement accurate advertising.""**

It is worth mentioning that Zilliqa, as a public chain, faces a competitive environment that cannot be overlooked. In response, Dong Xinshu said: **“The current competitive environment cannot be avoided, but I think this competition is benign and competition should aim to make a certain contribution to the ecology of the blockchain. After a certain period of time, the industry may There will be several public chains, each with its own merits and demerits, which will focus on the entire ecosystem, and the various projects and applications will be selected according to their own circumstances.Of course, in the process, we hope that the team within the industry will not Only focusing on competition leads to vicious competition. What is more important is that we can strengthen cooperation to promote the improvement and development of the entire ecosystem.""**

I'm a current bag hodler with long-term intentions, but this post got me wondering what's a good target amount of ZIL to hold given the current price and number of coins. Of course, the standard DYOR and ""Don't Invest More Than You Can Afford To Lose"" rules apply, but I just wanted to get the community's sense of ""ideal"" bag.

With test net around the corner I'd like to track the progress of amount of nodes joining, tps etc. I don't possess all the skills needed. Let's create a website together to track the progress of zilliqa. Resources in terms of money is no issue. Participation in terms of ideas, requirements and/or skills is being encouraged.


I'd like to pitch an idea and I'm curious how other people think about it and if we can work something out as a community:

First of all one of the reasons why I like Zilliqa so much is that beside the cutting edge technology and beside the level of professionalism and inclusiveness from the Zilliqa team it's the community that is open, supportive to newcomers and tends to be technology focused rather than price focused (I love it how we nailed the Binance community vote though)
In short, it's the whole package of technology and the community combined that makes me like Zilliqa so much. 


With the upcoming test net in mind a lot a Zilliqa adepts (including myself) are eager to run a node to help show the possibilities and potential of the Zilliqa project.
If I'm correct the release of the public test net will allow us to (partially) demonstrate the capabilities of Zilliqa if more and more nodes are joining.
And while thinking about the significance of the release of the public test net the next thing that came to mind was: ""I would like to track the progress during the testnet phase in terms of growth of nodes and tps of course"" and then I thought: this is something we can achieve (and fine tune) as a community.


While following and trying to read every bit of information in the blockchain space for some time I'm currently having one day a week to focus fully on blockchain (can be stretched if needed). Almost daily I work with relational databases (enterprise CRM software) but I don't have any experience in creating websites nor setting up servers with 'mining' software.



I was thinking of a mixture of something like ethstats.net where the initial focus would be on aggregated statistics rather than being a blockexplorer like etherscan.

A general idea of what would be needed in my opinion:

* defining which statistics are relevant to be measured (and can be measured as it's a test net)

* a website of course with some database functionality to store 'snapshots' of the progress over time (and to be able to present it visually)

* a server with a node running to retrieve the data from

* perhaps a knowledge base with several in depth articles about the workings of zilliqa/twitter feeds etc.


I do have the resources in terms of enthusiasm, eagerness to learn new things, money and time to coordinate the creation and maintaining of such a website. 

What are your ideas about this, what kind of skills would be needed to create such a thing and would you like to contribute?

Zilliqa uses sharding. It’s the centerpiece of zilliqa’s scaliablility technique that divides the entire network into smaller subspaces and processes transactions in parallel. 


IOS is using a dynamic validators-to-shards assignment protocol during epoch transitions while maintaining system operability. It also uses a two-step atomic commit protocol that guarantees transaction atomicity.


I think Zilliqa and IOS can work together. I feel like a partnership coming.","","865d6g",NA,0,NA,"false",1522336644,"false","self","t5_3nl60","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/zilliqa/comments/865d6g/i_found_zilliqa_little_sister/","","",NA,"","",0,0

Well, it seems like I won the lottery and the grand price at that. At first I thought it was a scam because you can never be too careful in the crypto world but then I looked closer and it actually said that I had to send 0 ETH to this address and not 1 ETH or more, like all the other scams.

Since they also knew my name I took my chances and had a Skype call with one of the employees. Turns out my name and my given ethereum address corresponds with the data I entered for the binance voting and now I got 500.000 more ZIL in my hodl wallet.

I mostly voted because I believed in the project but now I am more than certain that Zilliqa is one of the best things that happened to me.

So had to let everyone that they didn´t forget us, the community. Thanks Zilliqa and cheers to everyone reading this

Thank you!","1/ Single-shard takeover attacks - what if an attacker takes over the majority of the collators in one single shard, either to prevent any collations from getting enough signatures or, worse, to submit collations that are invalid?

2/ State transition execution - single-shard takeover attacks are typically prevented with random sampling schemes, but such schemes also make it more difficult for collators to compute state roots, as they cannot have up-to-date state information for every shard that they could be assigned to. How do we ensure that light clients can still get accurate information about the state?

3/ Fraud detection - if an invalid collation or state claim does get made, how can nodes (including light nodes) be reliably informed of this so that they can detect the fraud and reject the collation if it is truly fraudulent?

4/ Cross shard communication - the above design supports no cross-shard communication. How do we add cross-shard communication safely?

5/ The data availability problem - as a subset of fraud detection, what about the specific case where data is missing from a collation?

6/ Superquadratic sharding - in the special case where n &gt; c^2, in the simple design given above there would be more than O(c) collation headers, and so an ordinary node would not be able to process even just the top-level blocks. Hence, more than two levels of indirection between transactions and top-level block headers are required (ie. we need ""shards of shards"").

a. Zilliqa is the worlds first public, permission-less blockchain that has successfully implemented sharding to scale to thousands of transactions per second. If a blockchain can, in fact, handle 2500 TPS to 10,000 TPS, we can see actual real-world use cases tested on blockchains. If Zilliqa can prove it’s technology with some real word enterprise applications,  Zilliqa could become the de facto backbone for enterprise blockchain use.

b. The team behind Zilliqa are some of the brightest minds in the blockchain space, and they are at least a few years ahead of other teams attempting to solve scalability in blockchains. The CEO, Xinshu Dong, has significant experience working on the security and scalability of blockchain.

Other notables include the highly influential Loi Luu, founder of Kyber an official Advisor to Zilliqa.

c. COMPARISON to other existing blockchain platforms:

• **NEO** claims to be a permission-less network, whereas in reality, they are a permissioned network. NEO is centralized with the nodes being completely managed by the NEO team. (based in China, a country infamous for lack of social freedom)

• **EOS** goes the same way as NEO: the nodes are completely under the control of the EOS team only allowing trusted parties to act as nodes.

• **IOTA** through the DAG consensus (an alternative consensus algorithm to blockchain) does allow high-speed transactions, however DAG is not completely proven as of yet, and there are several challenges to be overcome. Blockchain is by far a more secure and well-known technology.

d. **WHY ZILLIQA STANDS OUT**

• Sharding implemted NOW; not just mere promises or vapourware.

• TX speeds increases linearly i.e the network's throughput capacity increases as new nodes join the network.

• Very Secure Network - Zilliqa has a very secure &amp; unique consensus algorithm Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT).

• Environmentally friendly - With Zilliqa, Proof of Work is only used to establish identity and one POW writes to multiple blocks at a time (rather than 1 single one) resulting in less energy used (vs Bitcoin or Ethereum) and higher rewards for the miners.

• Lower Transaction Fees - Ziliqa’s unique POW + PBFT algorithm allow for much lower transaction fees than competing blockchains like Ethereum and NEO.

• Smart Contracts - Zilliqa includes a smart contract layer (currently being built and due in Q2\) on top of the blockchain layer. This smart contract layer will include a Scilla a Solidary-like language. 

CONS

a. **Non Turing Complete Language** - Turing complete languages allows more complicated apps in comparison to Non Turing Complete language. So there will be a limitation here in the type of applications that can be developed as a dApp on the Zilliqa blockchain.

b. **Storage Challenge** -Due to a high throughput (thousands of TX per second), Gigabytes of data will be needed for storage. Zilliqa does transaction sharding, not state sharding, which essentially means each node has to store all the data. This is only possible with terabytes of storage available. The question is how Zilliqa manages to do it and if they can do it in such a way that does not negatively impact the high throughput ability of their blockchain.

c. **Non State Sharding** - Zilliqa implements sharding, but the sharding is transaction sharding, not state sharding. This is under research and nobody has come up with a working solution (yet).","false","8dkckl",NA,0,NA,"false",1529616542,"false","self","t5_3nl60","false","",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/zilliqa/comments/8dkckl/a_comprehensive_look_into_the_pros_and_cons_of/","t3_8dkckl",NA,NA,"","",0,0

The volume has dropped off over the past 23-36 hours which can be a concern if no news comes out. However, there is a lot of news worthy events happening in the Middle of May to the end of May. This could push the price up significantly. 

MACD is showing divergence and is now in oversold territory which is confirmed by RSI.

ZIL needs to move up and over the MA (25) for a short term confirmation of recovery and a continuation of a price increase.

Possible accumulation now until the next news event or until the next large buy or sell.

This can be done on Coinbase or a similar website. r/cryptocurrency will help decide which site is best for your country.*

**START HERE** if you have traded before

**Step 1:** Create an account on Kucoin and register with Google 2 step authenticator.

**Step 2:** Send ETH or BTC to your Kucoin account (I suggest using ETH as it generally has lower fees). You can find your ETH wallet address by clicking the deposit button next to the ethereum option in the assets tab.

**Step 3:** Once your ETH or BTC has been transferred to your Kucoin account, search for ZIL in the Markets tab and put in a buy request for either the current lowest sell price (this will be an instant buy) or set your own price and wait for the market price to drop.

ZIL value at time of post (May 4th 01:33 GMT) $0.127180 USD or 0.00001324 BTC or 0.00016656 ETH

My question is, why does no one talk about ZIL on the main Crypto sub?
It’s all about Ven, ICX, IOTA, Walton, etc...
I think in the last 5-6 weeks since I started reading I’ve seen ZIL mentioned once, and no one even blinked. No shill, no fud, nothing.

I contact you again and this time through social media because I got no response from you when I contacted you by email.

As I was pointing out so I sent 100 zilliqa on your wallet online. I never received them.  Today \(07 05 2018\), I will see again on the online portfolio and there I find posting that the portfolio is under test and that you should not make a deposit, this is something you never reported when I tried to deposit the zilliqa on the portfolio.

Here is for proof the transaction carried out: [https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9ed0769bcd67bbaf90fc6243b465523020e30832d76c69a200e3261ab3343afb](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9ed0769bcd67bbaf90fc6243b465523020e30832d76c69a200e3261ab3343afb)

2) Zilliqa has an announcement that is coming soon this month where sharding is one of Zilliqa's strength. i believe both ethereum and zilliqa can work together to build sharding technology to a whole new level. 

Zilliqa has the most potential to grow as their mainnet is approaching very soon.

All these posts are written by butt hurt people who are either afraid of zil taking a piece of the pie away from their chosen coins or trying to suppress price etc.  

There are many great projects and blockchains in crypto and zil is one of them. this is not a zero sum game - if it was there would only be one platform instead of hundreds all gaining market cap.

Don't sell because you see one stupid 'is this competition a problem for zil etc' and I encourage you to call out people pretending to do unbiased comparisons while essentially telling you you should be selling zil and buying something else

Zilliqa Project Update #9 has been published. In this update, we recap the Zilliqa: Sharding in Action &amp; Security by Design on 23 May 2018. We have also been around the world hosting meetup not only in home ground Singapore but also New York, Stockholm, Romania, China and Vietnam. 

The development team has been working on large-scale testing of our testnet and implementation of an interpreter as well as blockchain interfaces for our new smart contract language Scilla.

And we are proud to announce Vaivaswatha Nagaraj has joined as a compiler developer.

Looking forward to updating everyone else soon!

Articles I have read show that once the nodes are expanded (match to ETH) the limit would be similar to 10000txs.

However other currencies are shooting to beat VISA (60k txs) or serve a larger integrated service (IOT) at 1mil+ txs. 

Are there incentives or plans to push the txs past 10k with sharding? If so anyone have some good resources that would indicate this?

Would be cool to see 1mil txs like the ico (quark coin) 

in looking at estimates, there is roughly a txs to node ratio 70%. (2500txs/3600 nodes)
ETH has 36000 nodes (per zil white paper)... so the estimate would be 25000txs. 

is that impressive enough? is it possible to have 100000 nodes to get closer to visa 60k txs? 
would it really require 1mil nodes to get 700k txs or does sharding start making it even better?

white paper:

""A global payment network
would likely require tens of thousands of Tx/s in capacity.
Can we build a decentralized and open blockchain platform
capable of processing at that scale?""

""We present ZILLIQA— a new blockchain platform that is
designed to scale in transaction rates. As the number of miners
in ZILLIQA increases, its transaction rates are expected to
increase as well. Specifically, ZILLIQA’s design allows its
transaction rates to roughly double with every few hundred
nodes added to its network. As of this writing, the Ethereum
mining network is over 30,000 nodes. At Ethereum’s present
capacity, ZILLIQA would expect to process about a thousand
times the transaction rates of Ethereum.""

At 11:08 he mentions speaking with ""people"" at consensus about a rumor that Zilliqa might have hit a brick wall with their sharding technology and looking to scrap it and start over. He doesn't go into any details, but just sprinkles everyone with this info and moves on. This strikes me as odd. First because he is taking a rumor and throwing it out there without any confirmation, which feels a bit irresponsible on his part as a purveyor of credible information. I mean that's how dis-information campaigns get started... ""you didn't hear it from me, but I heard..."" and secondly, it feels strange that a company would about-face on their cornerstone tech and then, if true, somehow allow that info to get out there like that.

* Zil will be more powerful than ETH, atleast few thousand times more than ETH
* Zil has 2500 Transactions per second, ETH is around 10\-20 TPS and BTC is around 2 TPS
* Zil is more than half way in its development and implementation
* Zil already tested with 2500 TPS in testnets
* Zil is soon changing its cryptos from ERC\-20 to its own blockchain
* Zil's speed is as good as Mastercard's or Visa's TPS
* Zil is born in NUS, and it is one of the asia's TOP 3 universities
* Zil was originally a paper and after the researches done by scientists from Computer sciences department, they started this project, which is already half a success
* But Zil is not yet ready and will take few months
* But Zil is not fully adapted like ETH as it is not available for use
* But Zil is not as famous as ETH
* Then, Zil is affordable at this moment
* Then, Zil has lots of room to grow than ETH, very very long room to grow
* Then, ETH had just started to think about Shrading to overcome scalability, where as Zil already implemented it
* Then, ZIL has its own programming language and it is very easy to use and more fail\-proof than the one which ETH is built on. ETH cannot change their programming language as ETH was built on the conventional programming language.

One can do their own math to find out the pros and cons of Zil over ETH. That being said, I forecasted the Zil's price. Note that I dont have so much Zil and I am not a whale. I still hold a decent number of Zilliqa and trying to accumulate more till it reaches few dollars.

calculations are based on Zil @ 20 cents and ETH @ 700$ USD.

Zil Supply is 12.6 Billions and ETH supply is 100 Millions.

Zil/ETH=12.6B/100M=126. So, Zil has 126 times more supply than ETH. 

700/126=5.55$ USD

But ETH ranked @ #2 and Zil ranked @ #20, so Zilliqa's popularity and usage is not at par with ETH **at this moment**, so lets deduct 60&amp;#37; from Zil's price forecast to be fair. 

The current price on Zilliqa should be more than 2$ now.

IF Zil launched its mainnet and if it many cryptos moved from ETH to ZIL, then it should be more than ETH, because ETH cannot pull more than 20 TPS, where as ZiL can do 2400 TPS. So 1 ZIL = 120 ETH's Speed. Zil's Price of 5.55$ should be atleast 20\-100 times more than ETH. 

Again, all these calculations are based on ETH@700$ USD, if ETH price increases, so does the Zil price in the above calculation.

Overall, Zill has to be minimum 100$ per coin in 2020. ","false","8je2og",NA,0,NA,"false",1529721910,"false","self","t5_3nl60","false","",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/zilliqa/comments/8je2og/how_to_calculate_zilliqa_future_price/","t3_8je2og",NA,NA,"","",0,0

Obviously the true test of Zilliqa will be when it launches its own mainnet, but for now we've got to work within Ethereum's network, so lets see what data we can reveal...

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Lets get **Marketcap** �� out of the way first. Currently ZIL is sitting on **$494M** , which makes it **7th most valuable ERC20 token**.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Holders** ✊ - a highly respectable **29,924** addresses. ZIL is solidly placed in the 'Different Blockchains' category, in terms of marketcap and holders still behind Tronix, VeChain + ICON.

\*\*Top 20 addresses hold 70&amp;#37; of supply (\*\*obv. this mainly includes exchanges + team, but I've yet to figure out a way of identifying them then filtering them.)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Daily Active Users + Transactions**

[Amount of DAUs is quite high, although it does fluctuate a lot](https://i.redd.it/qebye5xp5t511.png)

There doesn't seem to be much of a pattern or stability with DAUs for ZIL.  It trends up for a few days, then trends down, with the occassional bigger spike.  Its certainly one of the more active tokens, often appearing near the top of the rankings for this metric.  As the project matures, I expect to see more holders and traders coming onboard, and thus this DAUs should increase over the coming months (\*\*A note on what I define a Daily Active User - a unique sender that sent the tokens using ERC20 transfer() method. *Only includes onchain transactions*.)

**Total Users for the last month** �� (May) was 15,914.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here's a fun metric I devised - make of it what you will!?

**Marketcap/MAU = $32,373**

I see this as a 'hype score' for a token. Its basically the value of a Monthly Active User to the network considering the Marketcap of the token. So in order to justify its marketcap, this is how much value would have to be extracted from each user. The more people that use the token, the lower this number will be, but equally, the higher the marketcap climbs without adding users, the more 'hyped' a project appears.

**By this metric ZIL outperforms Tronix, Vechain + ICON.**

What do you reckon - is this a sensible metric? Need feedback on this!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The site is still an **ugly beta**, but if I scrape together more funds or have some interest, then I can get a bigger stick to beat the code-monkey �� I have locked away, and I can do a much needed UI/UX overhaul.

Currently **data is pulled from a Parity node** and fed into a database. Its non-trivial to deal with all the shit tokens �� out there, so i've only made profiles for a few hundred. If you think of any details/metrics/data that would be useful to analyse ZIL let me know - i'll see what I can do!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Its also possible to check addresses and transaction history �� (its no Etherscan, but as i'm pulling all this data may as well!). You can save addresses without login (data stored in your browsers local storage, not our servers), so maybe a few of you will find this useful??

We are excited to announce Zilliqa Testnet v2.0 – Codename: D24 to all of you. In D24 we are unveiling a number of exciting features, including a working environment for developers to begin testing our secure smart contract language - Scilla. D24 will also allow developers to begin testing smart contract applications live on a testnet.

Specific features in D24 include:

1) Documentation https://scilla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ to begin programming applications in Scilla
2) Scilla Blockchain Integrated Development Environment (IDE), an integrated environment connected to a dedicated blockchain testnet, where users can a) write smart contracts, b) upload them to the blockchain, c) send messages to smart contracts and d) receive messages from them. The link to the wallet with smart contract functionality is available at https://wallet-scilla.zilliqa.com and the explorer for the dedicated Scilla testnet at https://explorer-scilla.zilliqa.com.
3) Scilla Interpreter Integrated Development Environment (IDE) https://ide.zilliqa.com where developers can write their Scilla programs and upload using the dedicated testnet in the Blockchain IDE above
4) An upgraded version of our existing testnet (1000 nodes) https://explorer.zilliqa.com and wallet https://wallet.zilliqa.com
5) Opening up the testnet for new nodes to join https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSesn-MxThl4ocKCrjUYSPGc463E7-1I1O1v_GGccYbqfFr7zg/viewform

Those price predictions that you see everywhere starting at a (conservative) $.50 and that go up to $1-$4 per coin by the end of 2018 are no joke, and fairly universally accepted, because Zilliqa's already proven itself to be technologically capable of outperforming so many others in transactions per second, by adding its own programming language (Scilla), and the fact that it can be easily adopted to any other blockchain.

TL;DR:  
Stop worrying about short-term swings, and just keep focusing on growing your stack.  
You WILL reward your own self in the (actually, not-so-distant) future.  

Edit: the *least* optimistic projection I've seen pegs it at $.36 at the end of 2018, so the possibility of growing your stack at 9-10 cents (if that's even possible again) would *still* make a huge difference rather than doing it at 12-13 cents.",NA,"8prnus",NA,0,NA,"false",1536354469,"false","self","t5_3nl60","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/zilliqa/comments/8prnus/the_best_way_to_view_zilliqa_you_should_be/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

Zilliqa Project Update #11 has been published. We have been busy preparing for the release of Testnet v2.0 end of this month that will begin to support Scilla, the new smart contract language that Zilliqa will be using. To encourage developers to build for/on the platform we have opened applications for the USD5m Zilliqa Ecosystem Grant. You can read about it here https://blog.zilliqa.com/buildonzil-introducing-the-zilliqa-ecosystem-grant-programme-6ccb98892712. 

On the tech front, the team has been focusing on the implementation of the coinbase mechanism to reward miners, NAT resolver for new nodes joining and the smart contract layer. We look forward to sharing with you on Testnet v2.0 very soon. Cheers!

New announcements, another exchange, moving ahead of schedule...they all combined today to put Zilliqa back on track, giving it a 'top leading gainers' position on Binance today, which will bring back the volume it was lacking for a while.  
It's going to be an interesting few months ahead, to say the least!
  
Edit: I didn't even mention what may be the biggest step: acceptance and use for smart contracts in the insurance industry. That's one of Zilliqa's main goals, and that alone could give it a *huge* pump in value.

 is the decentralized database service for dApps(Zilliqa dAPPs Q4 2018). Just as decentralized services like Filecoin and Storj are needed for file storage and management, Bluzelle is needed for data storage and management. It makes the decentralized internet complete, complementing these other components and solving a major infrastructural need.

Bluzelle combines reliable ‘swarm’ technology, boundless scaling ability and dynamic performance to ensure the decentralized Internet can scale and run efficiently.Zilliqa is blockchain protocol focused on delivering high throughput – scaling to thousands of transactions per second. Bluzelle and Zilliqa are working together to provide an integrated solution so users building dApps with Zilliqa as the underlying blockchain can use Bluzelle for decentralized data storage.

Bluzelle is headquartered in Singapore and has an office in Vancouver, Canada where they do most of their research and development. Singapore puts the team within a couple hour flight of a lot of key markets like Japan, Korea, and India. Bluzelle has a money service license in Canada, allowing them legally to handle money under Canadian FINTRAC (Financial Transactions and Report and Analysis Center). Singapore has become a big spot in the Fin Tech industry and has welcomed many crypto asset and blockchain startups.

***ENIGMA (ENG)
One of the most important functions of Enigma is that it creates an off-chain storage for private data. This off-chain storage of private data is attached as a second layer to an existing blockchain. People involved can run and store computations on the data without the possibility of viewing the content. They can only view the content if the existing blockchain grants access.

By using a Turing-complete language, each node is scripted with a stand-alone piece of probably random information so that the complete date is not in the hands of a single party; this part of Enigma allows privacy to remain truly decentralised.

By using smart contracts to implement this function, Enigma allows users to send encrypted data using smart contracts. This all happens without the comprising of their computation and also prevents any single party from viewing all the content.
Enigma Catalyst

Catalyst aims to be a one-stop shop for quantitative trading. It will allow analysts (quants) to develop trading algorithms, back test their strategies with real data hosted on Enigma, and deploy their strategies for live trading. Besides using their own money for live trading with their algorithms they can also market their algorithms and earn a ‘royalty’ fee when their algorithms are used. Catalyst will be the first app to be built on top of Enigma. The term “Catalyst” is chosen because it’s meant to accelerate the adoption of the Enigma platform.
Enigmas’ team

Enigma has a team of MIT graduates and the cryptocurrency ENG is backed by an impressive academic whitepaper and they also have a equally impressive group of advisors including CEO of Abra, Bill Barhydt and director of MIT media lab, Prof. Alex Pentland.

We gotta trim the clones. Remove and/or point the posters to the oldest most active original post.

I use Cryptopanic for the latest news and the majority of news is pointing to this subreddit to nothing but clone posts. Im looking at your ethereum game dapp migration. Cool news but we do not need reminding every few hours.  

Or start a daily discussion mega thread and point people there to talk about the repeated topics. Lets keep the core posts for ""New"" news.

I noticed that *every single one* of those projects is listed on the Crypto Index Funds [chart](https://i.imgur.com/o3eWAl1.jpg) that I posted the other day.

I then decided to make a 'fake portfolio' using exactly $1K worth of only those coins, ""bought"" today at their market prices on Binance.
(I made sure each one is not currently in a runup or a beatdown).

(I did ""spend"" (not with actual money) *exactly* 1K on each coin; THETA just pumped right after, that explains the current value discrepancy.)

* Zilliqa claims a relatively low energy foot print due to the PoW and pBFT setup where PoW is really only performed 12h per month for a participating node. What I don't get is how this lowers the energy footprint. Considering that all future block rewards are known, miners can estimate exactly how much computational resources they ought to point at Zilliqa during the PoW time period. Will the summed computational cost (electricity and hardware) during this small period not in the end sort of equal the consequent summed block rewards that a miner is entitled to should he/she pass the PoW anti-Sybil threshold (which ought to quickly adjust to high-difficulty levels)?
* What role does ZIL tokens have with regards to the pBFT algo? Am I correct in understanding them as irrelevant in the sense that passing the PoW threshold is enough for a node to be able to claim newly minted ZIL during the pBFT block building process, and that the amount of already owned ZIL has no importance whatsoever? What I am getting at is whether Zilliqa differs from PoS coins where the rewards generally are proportional to number of (staked) tokens.",NA,"8w4c0s",NA,0,NA,"false",1536482990,"false","self","t5_3nl60","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/zilliqa/comments/8w4c0s/question_on_zilliqa_pow_and_pbft/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

Fundementdal Analysis:  Firstly lets look at their market cap and supply of coins available. the last couple of ears crypto currencies have increased the supply of coins and at first deemed as a negative we can look back to recent market price action and compare coins with similar if not more supply. one example would be ripple. ripple has a circulating supply of  39,262,097,329 XRP  thats over 500&amp;#37; more in circulation than zilliqa and thats only circulating supply. when we look at total supply ripple has 7.9 times the amount of ZIL ( 99,991,924,336 XRP ). why is this important? one of the main selling points of crypto is scarecity. scarecity allows for currency or monetary systems to become rare. the more rare the more valueable in some cases. 

now lets look at market cap. currencty zilliqa is 26th on coinmarketcap, so investors are aware of the coin. additionally its only 1/32th of the market cap of ripple. to me this sounds as if the coin is undervalued based on those three fronts. now you must be saying bro wtf are you talking about ripple and zilliqa are completey differnt coins have complety different protocols partnerrships etc. and your right! so ill foocus more on tech and forget ripple. 

Circulating supply -  7,575,893,444 ZIL 

Maximum supply -  12,600,000,000 ZIL 

market cap -  $597,059,193 USD 

Current Price -  **$0.078810** USD/ 0.00001193 BTC 

the tech: zilliqa coin might be new but the team has worked diligently in the space even co authoring the scientific paper on blockchain sharding in 2015. here is a excerpt from their website briefly explaining their consensus protocol  **The protocol has novel advances over what has been published by Zilliqa team members in scientific conference papers. It comprises of the overarching layer of directory committee, and a refinement of the PBFT protocol in each shard. Zilliqa employs Elliptic Curve Based Schnorr Signature Algorithm (EC-Schnorr) with multi-signing or signature aggregation. This means that the size of the signature stays small even when a lot of miners sign a block.** **Moreover, by leveraging efficient network topology, Zilliqa's consensus scheme reduces the communication complexity to O(N), i.e., linear to the size of the network.** 

why is sharding so important? zilliqa has proven its able to do over 2800 trasnactions a second with only a few shards. projects like etheruem hope to move to sharding adn casper in the near future and we can use that information to discern that 1) the most valuable alt coin wants to implement it and 2) zilliqa already has giving them the upper foot. another reason for them being undervalued. i could go into their enegery saving solutions to mining or how they prevent dao hacks or even how they solve decentralized storage with one their partnerships but ill save that for another day. lastly ill leave you with the price prediction.

using all the info above if zilliqa were to obtain the evaluation of that of ripple (yes that is possible. ripple can even stay where is) we can conclude that the price would be back to .13 cents and if it were to 4x its market cap we can assume is would follow suit and become .50 cents. so by end of 2018 i can see zilliqa being somewhere around .30 cents if all is natural growth over time and the team continues its phenomenal run.

below i linked a chart of zilliqa with a few possibilities for the short term future

&gt; **State sharding.** With increase in ZILLIQA’s user base and
its high transaction throughput would come the following
challenge: How to efficiently handle the continuous influx of
blocks that modify the global state. This is also referred to
as state sharding in the literature. In essence, state sharding
will alleviate full nodes from storing and receiving all blocks
and transactions. This way it can further reduce the storage
and communication load for nodes, and thus constitute another
scaling-up factor to the throughput. However, it is non-trivial
to design a secure and efficient state sharding scheme, as
cross-shard communications arising from state sharding may
outweigh the performance gains. More research needs to be
done to address such additional complexities.

Earlier on the white paper talks about how transaction sharding works:

&gt; Sharding transactions based on the sender’s account address
natively allows shard members to detect double spend as every
transaction from a sender will be processed within the same
shard.

My question is, has any thought been given to the idea of not sharding based on account address, but rather treating shards as fully independent stores of value?

This would be a scheme whereby every account address would conceivably have a balance in more than one shard.  Sending tokens to another account would either create a new account for the receiver on that shard if none already existed and then update its balance accordingly.

A consequence/feature of this scheme would be that every shard would always have a fixed number of tokens that would/should never change.

This comes from the white paper too:

&gt; A user of our blockchain who would like to submit a
transaction for acceptance can then check the information
on sharding to get the shard responsible for processing her
transaction.

So instead what would need to happen here is that the wallet that the user is using would need to differentiate between network transactions and shard transactions and know how to format the former into one or more of the latter as necessary.  The user typically only sees the network transaction.  The nodes making up a shard only see the shard transaction.  Making the wallet do more work lets the network scale better?

I've been giving this some thought and the only downside I can see is that every node has to contend with larger account tables, but wouldn't it be the case that its storage used up front that buys you savings down the road in reduced block counts?",NA,"8y1hwj",NA,0,NA,"false",1536588976,"false","self","t5_3nl60","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/zilliqa/comments/8y1hwj/questionsuggestion_about_state_sharding/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

My co-founder and I along with a few researchers built a site that explains hundreds of coins.

We wrote short tight summaries, researched the teams, show a score based on Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook activity, found the best explainer videos, categorized all of them. 

We did all this so there would be a free resource to introduce new users to blockchain projects and grow the communities. 

Lots of long hours and late nights... may have missed a thing or 2. Will you guys take a look at the ZIL page and let us know if any of the info is wrong, anyone not listed from the team, generally anything you think we missed.

Grateful for the help in making this info accurate and useful for introducing new users to the community.

We are happy to announce that we have published a new blog post that explains how to run smart contracts on a sharded architecture like Zilliqa: https://blog.zilliqa.com/provisioning-sharding-for-smart-contracts-a-design-for-zilliqa-cd8d012ee735.

Running smart contracts on a sharded architecture brings into picture some exciting research problems that the blockchain community has been looking into lately. In this blog post, we present our solution to the problem that we refer to as “Deterministic Transaction Assignment”. The post also presents the status of the implementation. Give it a read and let us know your thoughts.

**About ZIL**  
Zilliqa is a new blockchain platform that is designed to scale in an open, permission-less distributed network securely. The core feature that makes Zilliqa scalable is sharding — dividing the network into several smaller component networks (called shards) capable of processing transactions in parallel.

**About AXNET:**  
[Asset Exchange Network OÜ (AXNET)](https://ax.net/) is a licensed virtual currency to fiat exchange with a licensed virtual wallet platform based out of Estonia. We service our traders worldwide by giving them the first hybrid trading platform that offers both a Centralized and Decentralized exchange that allows our traders to toggle between the two.

As we all know, the market is crashing right now and some of our favorite alt-coins are reaching ATLs since launching. My purely intuitive rationale for this is that we've reached a temporary saturation for the current level of development in the space. We saw a huge influx of ICO money in 2017 and rampant price escalation via BTC price speculation. For the ICO portion, we're now in a wait and see period as the various teams work to develop their tech for implementation and adoption. Eventually, many of these projects will emerge with products, dApps, and some form of utility for regular people and enterprises alike. Until these events unfold, the prices will likely not move up as drastically -- which, in my opinion, shouldn't be discouraging at all. The money came in too fast from FOMO and now there isn't as much capital coming from the layman FOMO investor, so the same FOMO layman investors are now panic-selling themselves back-out. Layman investor panic, along with the ETF futures and various shorting-mechanisms, as well as deliberate suppression and manipulation, could all be significant contributing factors to the continued downtrend. The price has been steadily going down, and that simply isn't attractive to anyone looking to invest in the space.

That said, we're approaching a time where more merit based price movements can occur. Movements will not be based as much on price speculation and FOMO so much as real-world use, adoption, and demand as the current capitalization moves from coin to coin. For Zilliqa holders, this shouldn't be a point of concern -- especially when ZIL is compared to its counterparts in the crypto-space. Here are some of the things that have me feeling good about Zilliqa:

\- Zilliqa has a partnership with Mindshare. For those of you that don't know, Mindshare is a gigantic media and marketing consortium. That said, there's a lot to be excited about for Zilliqa beyond brand-name recognition here. To make a long story short, integration with Zilliqa's public blockchain can save Mindshare and Mindshare's clients a ton of money every single day. See this article for a very well-written synopsis of the problem and solution that well positioned blockchain technologies (like Zilliqa) can provide:

[https://cryptobriefing.com/blockchain-advertising-coming-fast/](https://cryptobriefing.com/blockchain-advertising-coming-fast/)

\- Zilliqa is partnered with DELOITTE (one of the big four professional services companies in the world) as well as some massive insurance companies. Similar to digital advertising, insurance companies or companies seeking large-scale risk aversion can realize huge benefits by integrating with advanced blockchain technologies like Zilliqa. But don't take my word for it, get it directly from the lion's mouth here:

\- With high throughput greater than that of traditional centralized financial competitors and drastically lower settlement fees, Zilliqa can and will emerge as the preferred method for local and cross-border B2B, consumer/vendor, and personal transactions. Oddly enough, many of the mainstream articles coming out are still fixated on dismantling the entire crypto-space as a payment system on account of the notable shortcomings of BTC and Ethereum. While that's keeping the layman investors shy, it won't for long as Zilliqa and its transaction advantages become more known and ubiquitous as marketing and business development efforts ramp-up closer to and after the establishment of Zilliqa's mainnet -- enter Yiling Ding (former Head of APAC Regional Marketing for Google Pay). This can't be understated as a Head of Marketing for Google Pay left the gigantic company that is Google for an up and coming, and favourable payment technology that is Zilliqa.

All things considered, Zilliqa's real use cases cannot and will not be dismissed -- they will prevail. Yes it sucks to see the price go down, but that is just a momentary aside from an obviously disruptive and promising blockchain/crytocurrency project on the rise. As far as price is concerned, remember that if you're selling someone else is on the other side buying, why might that be the case? As always, DYOR but for the layman investors acting as if there is some sort of warranted apocalypse of blockchain and cryptocurrency, a simple search of the use cases for public blockchain and cryptocurrency might have you feeling rightfully positive and informed.

The Zilliqa team is committed to building a secure, scalable and decentralized blockchain platform. Amongst all existing solutions to achieve scalability such as off-chain, sidechains and others, we believe that sharding is a very promising one towards linear scalability. We are happy to have made sharding a reality by releasing the first testnet network that is sharded.

We have also finalized the design to run smart contracts on a sharded architecture which will be incorporated in the first production release of Zilliqa. This design ensures that transactions involving smart contracts can be processed in parallel across shards and the directory service committee. The entailed protocol will have no restrictions on the type of Scilla smart contracts that can be run. We will soon be releasing a blog post to explain the architecture that we have started to implement.

Since the release of our technical whitepaper back in August 2017, we have come a long way and have modified part of the initial design and implemented new techniques to make the protocol more performant and more secure. For instance, we have merged the two PoWs (as outlined in the whitepaper) into a single PoW. We have also replaced raw transaction data sharing with state-change sharing. Oftentimes, such modifications to the protocol design required a complete re-design of certain parts of the system.

In the past few weeks, we have had extensive discussions to review the timeline in light of these enhancements. Unfortunately, we will need more time to ensure that the code gets properly tested by the core team, the community and last but not the least, established auditing firms. We will also be leveraging the additional time to:

- Conduct thorough security audits
- Prepare for and execute the token swap
- Integrate with wallets
- Develop toolchains 
- Bring more dapps onboard


We will be updating the community about the mainnet timeline along the way. At this stage, we are targeting end of this year or January 2019. We apologize for the delay but we firmly believe that it is in the best interest of the long-term future of the project and would like to seek your support and understanding.

Sincere thoughts,
The Zilliqa Team",NA,"950i15",NA,0,NA,"false",1536716550,"false","self","t5_3nl60","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/zilliqa/comments/950i15/new_update_regarding_mainnet/",NA,"","false","","",0,1

Perhaps that combined with the effect of the impending mainnet release?  
The frequent updates of news from the team members?

Next will be financial settlement; the best part is Zilliqa won't need the help of the SEC or wall street to get there.

Eth can't survive without BTC and favourable SEC determinations, NEO is at the mercy of the Chinese government, Zilliqa is in its own class -- especially following the release of the main net.

Grateful I chose Zilliqa.

EDIT: I guess I should clarify: short-term all projects are reliant on the survival of blockchain and cryptocurrency which is predominantly indicated by the health of BTC during this bear market.

Long-term: Zilliqa will put its use case into practice and develop its own economy and ecosystem that can exist apart from BTC and Ethereum based on Zilliqa's advantageous fundamentals.

We have had an exciting two weeks and I am excited to share what we’ve been up to in Zilliqa Project Update #17. From our first-ever Scilla workshop in Cluj, Romania to our new browser-based IDE, we’ve been working hard at making Scilla easier to use for developers. We also announced our partnership with Mindshare and other leading companies to explore some of the major challenges facing the digital advertising industry.

In addition, we are seeing our ecosystem grant awardees make great progress in building wallets, tools, and libraries for Zilliqa. One of our web extension wallet grantees, [Appberry extension](https://github.com/appbery/Zilliqa-Chrome-Wallet), is already capable of sending ZILs over the Scilla testnet.

We will be at Consensus: Singapore this week, and hope to see many of you there!

On the technology front, we have been working on implementing dual difficulty levels of Proof of Work – a relatively easier level for joining as a node in a shard, and a more difficult level to qualify as a potential member of the DS committee. We’ve also been improving the stability of DS microblocks.

As always, eager to hear your feedback and suggestions. Let us know if there is anything you want to hear more of in our updates!

Below are some of the criteria:

Prototype: There is a working alpha or beta product on a testnet or mainnet.

**Definitely.. With mainnet coming in this EOY**

Practical Applications There are examples of real-world implementation or future practical applications.

**Yes. Currently it has partnership with some advertisement companies.**

US Securities Law: The asset is not classified as a security using Coinbase's Securities Law Framework.

**Still a gray area**

Nodes: Growing # of nodes on the underlying blockchain. The project has a globally distributed node network, meaning operating nodes are not contained in a single country or geographic region.

**Yes.. It's decentralized**

Team Ownership: The ownership stake retained by the team is a minority stake. There should be a lock-up period and reasonable vesting schedule to ensure the team is economically incentivized to improve the network into the future.

**Yes.. Based on the whitepaper..**

I have just joined the team as CMO and am excited to share Zilliqa Project Update #16 with you. We have just published details on our solution to one of the most challenging and exciting problems in blockchains today - supporting smart contracts in a sharded network. In addition, we are constantly looking to grow our ecosystem - if you are interested in building a blockchain-based game or Decentralised exchange, do reach out to us!

We will be at several events across the globe this month, from Romania to Berlin to Beijing, rounding off with Singapore.

Please also welcome Han Wen, who has joined as Developer Relations.

On the technology front, we have implemented new features – events (you can now automatically retrieve data from the blockchain), transaction generator and difficulty adjustment of PoW.

As always, eager to hear your feedback and suggestions. Let us know if there is anything you want to hear more of in our updates!

After a tokens ICO is finished, the tokens are typically sent to the investors immediately. Listings on major exchanges take a lot of time and money and are usually not a speedy process if they ever happen at all. A handful of ERC20 decentralized exchanges have popped up that allow for first access to these tokens. ERC20 decentralized exchanges however are difficult to use for the average person. You must use meta mask, constantly have ether in gas for any transactions, and sometimes the network is really slow and expensive to use. Since the processes to acquire these tokens is not easy, a lot of average crypto investors simply won’t buy them until they’re on a bigger exchange, and by then they have already missed out on big gains.

Ethershift wants to make the process of acquiring the newest ERC20 tokens as simple as possible for everyone.
