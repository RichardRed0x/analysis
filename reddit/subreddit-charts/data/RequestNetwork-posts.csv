The Request Network project was not actually in Y Combinator, from what I can tell. Instead, a totally unrelated project with the same founders was in YC just at the beginning of this year. Its called Moneytis and all it is is Booking.com for money transfers (helps you find the lowest fees).  

This is concerning because people were saying that Request Network is YC backed and they would ""shove it down the throats of normies in Silicon Valley"".

1. Pre-sale investors playing ico investors like chumps. They immediately sold for 20% gains at open causing a panic and setting their own buy orders at 0.00016. Easy money.

2. Noobs panicking and selling for a loss.

3. Whale manipulation on ED.

4. People cutting their losses and trying to flip Ripio (RIP)

5. Lack of exchange support didn't allow BTG alt bounce money to flow into REQ. If we were on polo or bittrex I believe we would be surfing the up wave for sure. ED is just too much of a pain to use.

6. OMG is set to announce a new updated roadmap this week, plus two new partnerships with Yuge Japanese companies.

7. It's crypto. Shit happens.

That would mean 1000 REQ = 1 ETH is the floor or 0.001 eth/req.

There is so much unsatisfied demand for req tokens out there, and I think if ico participants make it a point to not sell cheap it would be better for all of us. 

This has the potential to pull an OMG and people are already saying it's like the OMG of the West. So with that said 5x could be still selling low, but for those who want to de-risk their portfolio I think it is a good floor to set.

We can move to Kucoin to trade REQ more easily at very low trading fee.

Kucoin is a Professional and Reliable Cryptocurrency Exchange Platform with the following features:
Legal Compliance, Easy and Convenient, Advanced technologies, Solid System, Fund Safety, 7*24 Customer Service. I believe the price of KCS can reach 1$ before the end of Oct. 

 The trading fee on Kucoin is very low compared to most exchanges. You can go to  official registration @kucoincom for free KCS tokens and 80% trading fee discount in one month: https://www.kucoin.com/#/signup?r=E2OFDh. 
It has supported KCS, SNT, BTM, BHC, MTH, EOS, CVC, USDT, KNC, PAY, OMG, NEO,QTUM, BTC, GAS, ETH, LTC, WTC, HSR, and will list BBR, RPX in recent days. And will add dozens of other hot tokens in the coming month.

I think it is quite potential, and my analysis are:


1. The 80% discount trading fee for every coin on Kucoin, will finished on 27th, Oct. After that, the bonus by holding KCS will quadruple, i.e., 4X. At the same time, KCS holders still get 50% or more of the trading fees from Kucoin team as bonus. It will boom the price of KCS.

2.  Kucoin will list several more hot tokens with large market cap before Nov. This act, first, it will bring high trading volume on Kucoin, second, it will let more people know Kucoin and KCS. This will also boom the price of KCS.

3. Compared to Binance, Kucoin has higher experience feedback from users, while the market cap of KCS is just one third to half of BNB. When KCS price reaches $1, it just has half market cap of BNB. So it still has much room to boom. 

4. Most tokens listed on Kucoin has two or three time of trading volume than last day. As you can see, it is growing quite fast. It will deliver rapidly growing bonus to KCS holders. The team is willing to hear voice from users, and updated their work quickly.

5. Kucoin team is efficient and effective in platfrom developing and fostering community of users. The members of several Kucoin communities is growing faster and faster.

6. The official registration @kucoincom for free KCS tokens and 80% trading fee discount in one month: https://www.kucoin.com/#/signup?r=E2OFDh .

7. Kucoin exchange and KCS token has been added to CoinMarketCap, more people will know it. In addition, Blockflio has promised on their official twitter to add it just after CoinMarketCap.

8. Kucoin team is updating their whitepaper to describe Kucoin and KCS more clearly, and will publish a new version before next week.

9. Kucoin team is working on the development of Apps on mobile phones, i.e. Android and iOs version, soon will release them. It will be more convinient for users to use Kucoin. 

10. The price of KCS is growing steadily, it is not a bump and pump token.

•	Ycomibinator + ING Bank backed

•	Ycombinator lists this as the Paypal 2.0

•	Throws in an Amazon screenshot (they could potentially be working with amazon)

•	USA citizens not allowed - lot of people will fomo into this

•	Q4 2017 will already have a working product

•	20,000+ members in slack - one of the largest slack groups

•	Can’t be bought easily by whales so no price manipulation / walls

•	Has an eth domain

•	Built with 0x

•	Experienced and well known team (Moneytis)



Don’t sell your REQ tokens cheap. We are holding valuable thing here don’t undervalue it in any case. Even the flipers, sell high, hold your ground. We’ve been through a lot of difficult situations last month, appreciate that, don’t give your efforts for free.

---------------------

**Summary of my REQ whale watching** if anyone is interested: 

There were large presale whales and contribution pools (I tracked 46.6m REQ), REQ admins say 56m (https://imgur.com/a/dbOFe):

ICO price: 0.0002 ETH/REQ

Presale price: 0.00016 ETH/REQ (20% bonus)

Current EtherDelta volume is 57m REQ as of now (8 hours since the start of trading), if I count only tokens I have personally tracked, the 4 whales had sold  81% of REQ daily volume (if we assume that all transfered funds were already liquidated, which is unlikely), the rest can be attributed to daytrading  and weak hands (I personally did some day trading, love post Byzantium ED speed).

The average weighted sale price was 0.00018743 so average presale profit of 17.1% Which is a great result for most institutional investors as they aim at minimum risk results and can't risk entering the weekend with an open position.

What stuns me that price did not really crash even with institutional selling there is a huge buying pressure on REQ and bulls bough almost 10k ETH worth of REQ just on ED, personally, this makes me feel very positive. I trade on ED a lot and last time I have seen this kind of volume was with ZRX (same day 1 institutional selling)

My small piece of advice, when our lizard brain tells to sell because of emotions (we are programmed to flee from danger),  you can burn yourself, base your trading decisions on cold facts and logic. I am personally holding and not going to fall victim to FUD campaign and institutional profit-taking. My main reason for not selling at these prices is this: https://imgur.com/a/mDOJY

But everybody should interpret these facts as they wish and base their trading decision on their own strategy

PLS STOP?","While the price talk is total rabies, and I can't wait for us to move on to more exciting features when released, do indulge me this one time.

&amp;nbsp;

Discredit me for being relatively new to crypto (5 months), but I'd take my chances than to sell away my ICO-priced coins for 2x-4x on a project like Request. 

&amp;nbsp;

My entry into Antshares/NEO was $7 (peaked $50), OMG when it was $3 (peaked $13). But ask anybody who held their $0.20 OMG or $0.15 NEO, they'll laugh it off saying, ""You late AF, bruh"".

&amp;nbsp;

Request was one of the few ICOs that stood out to me, after going through at least a hundred different ICO projects that was a process that had me rolling my eyes, going **""wtf?""**, because they were gunna implement monthly lotteries, or had some weird target market in some obsecure part of the world or was yet another self proclaimed decentralized P2P-Bitcoin-Monero-Litecoin clone. 

&amp;nbsp;

And while it's **waaaaaaaaaay** too early to deem Request as 'Unicorn' tier or even top 20 at this point, consider this, projects with proper direction, backing and structure (whitepaper wise) and a viable target market for their future product, are really hard to come by.  

&amp;nbsp;

So flippers, do as you always have, the whales will thank you, investors who were quietly hoping for a day 4 firesale will have their wishes granted. People who weren't whitelisted will get their opportunity. and you'll get your profit. Everybody's happy, what's not to like?

&amp;nbsp;

Git ready and welcome the resident FUDsters, (if the coin was truly dead, there'd be no reason for them to post if you ask me.) A brand new cycle of getting rid of the impatient Moon-worshipping lambokids who threw in grammy's $100 in birthday money has just begun.

Its obvious the price has been heavily suppressed. This supression simply means that it will trend upward with even more momentum than we thought. It will be very interesting to see how it unfolds. Walton was heavily suppressed after being listed, and look how its doing now. I am confident REQ will be similar.

Not to mention ChainLink was sitting close to 200 million market cap for the majority of its time, and is still sitting just south of 100 million.

We’re going to assume a .5% tx fee, 50% stakers, and Request taking 50% of the fees.

Okay lets assume they can get to $10 billion in transaction volume (for reference paypal runs through $400 billion). With $10 billion in volume, a staker with 100k REQ tokens would receive $7,500

We can assume most investors will be looking for 7-8% ROI from staking alone so lets divide that $7,500 / .07 = $107,000. That means those 100,000 REQ tokens should be worth about $107,000, or about $1.07 per token. 

ICO price is .068 so 15.7x ICO would be a good place to start based on the above numbers, and assuming REQ can get to $10 billion in total volume.

Even if that $10 billion in volume is 1-2 years out, I still expect the REQ price to come close to that 15.7x based on future expectations ONLY.

There was a clear message to the community  before the ICO that they are up to fair token distribution and they don't want whales to get into it.  
It turned out to be lies - there were whales.
Furthermore it turned out that whales got at least 20% discount (we still don't know what discounts got seed and private investors).

I've seen the latter happen way too many times with other various coins and everytime the lack of exchanges and communication kills the particular given coin's value.

[Please read for some real discussion]","If you are interested looking for information and understanding of the merit of this project, and tired of the endless and inane chatter of the “ICO Price dump! No Moon = will sue!” comments, please read on.

Firstly, REQ is looking at getting into the most inefficient and problematic spaces of the Payments ecosystem that is poorly understood, valued and ignored (including by high level corporate decision makers).
Looking beyond just the price of transactions is critically important when understanding where severe inefficiencies lie in the Conversion-to-Cash Cycle (CCC) for both Buyers and Sellers in a B2B context (G2G and G2B context also).

There are numerous thought leadership pieces out there, where the most significant pain points of the Payment Process are clearly identified and quantified, primarily;

For Buyers;  
- Reducing Costs;  
- Increased Accuracy;  
- Increased AP Productivity;  
- Faster processing and payment Cycles;  
- Refocus of Accounting Efforts;  
- Enhanced accounts reconciliation;  
- Reduced Fraud, duplicates and Late Fees; and,
- Improved Supplier Relationships and Optimised Community Management

For Suppliers;  
- Faster Payments;  
- Reduced Costs;  
- Fewer rejected invoices;  
- Increased Productivity;  
- Enhanced Accounts reconciliation;  
- Improved Cash Management; and,  
- Alternative Financing Options

The value of these improvements reduce a fully burdened transaction from;  
-  ~€18 to ~€7 for Suppliers; and,  
-  ~€7 to ~€5 for Buyers.

This is no small change, noting that there more than 20bn B2B transactions in Europe alone, which could lead to annualised savings of more that €300bn in savings….and that is a conservative estimate
Moreover less than 60% of payments are YET to be fully digital – but with heavy regulation push from the EU (mandatory reporting in 2018) and desire from Central Governments for full reporting and visibility these numbers will explode.

And we are just talking Europe as an example…. 

If this isn’t enough to be piquing your interest, consider the focus of the biggest influencers in the Business Community.
Who?  
- Tier 1 Management Consulting Firms (McKinsey, Bain, BCG et.al) who are already publishing their ‘marine’ pieces to position for key Financial Transformation; and,  
- In the execution side where companies like Deloitte, PwC have ‘spin decks’ out there to focus on exactly the same thing.  

REQ – unlike MOST crypto offerings out there has probably one of the most compelling cases out there (maybe the biggest?). Massive real world application of NEED to solve an actual issue using the tech

So I've been reading up on REQ and for the most part am very impressed. My one point of concern though is the token usage. When I say ""concerned"", I mean in the sense that I hope a project as promising as REQ hasn't just slapped an unnecessary token on its product like so many other projects.

IMO the whitepaper wasn't very clear in describing REQ token usage (""participants will need to pay a network fee in REQ""). So I assume ""participants"" only refers to the sellers implementing Request network? Because I can't imagine that the average buyer would know how to/be bothered purchasing REQ. For example - merchant A decides to implement REQ on their website, do they need to purchase any REQ prior to this? Or are REQ fees automatically deducted from each payment?

Also read PoS mentioned but again it's not clearly described. If anyone knowledgable could help clarify it'd be much appreciated.

My current plan is to sell a portion of my stack once it hits exchanges and then buy them back. That way if for some reason the price doesn't drop I would still have a decent stack.

HOW!? 
OK so REQ was offered to the public during ICO for 0.0002 ETH, that is true. Whats lost on many posters is that it was also sold privately BEFORE the ICO went public- in a invite-only extra-discounted Pre-sale. From what I have read, this was at least ~20% less than the public ico, or about 0.00016 ETH. 

So yeah. Stop spreading this false narrative of panicked sellers selling at a net $ loss. We, the smart and patient REQ investor, know better than to sell off our REQ treasure but many a fool read these forums and fools are spooked easily

But that's my mistake and the fundamentals of the coin haven't changed so it's changed to a mid to long term hold for me instead of quickly selling half at a mad profit like I'd envisaged.

If you're in the same boat as me, stop crying for legislation that can't protect people from greed and laziness which are human attributes that will exist no matter how much red tape we try to strangle innovation with.  Man up, admit your mistake (if it was one) and sell out or hold for the longer term.

Amount of REQ being sold atm below ICO Price: 

•	EtherDelta (56% of market) = Approx. 6.000.000 REQ

•	Asuming the same for the other markets (Liqui – Gate.io – Decentrex) that represent the other 44% of market, will give us Approx. 4.700.000 REQ.

So we can say that 10.700.000 REQ Approx. is being sold below ICO price across all markets.

This represents only 1.7% of tokens being sold below ICO price. 

Meaning we will need an investment of 1800-2150 ETH ($540.000 - $650.000) to reach ICO price.

If we compare REQ to OMG, their fist 2 pumps were $7m and $40m approx. So is really a 1.7% buy wall really that high? That is making people panic and sell at a loss?

If you are here right now, high five, this is going to be a fun ride.

Much of this information is from a fellow Request Network Holder; Redditor Strifesfate. Wherever you are, thank you for helping to explain the prospects of Request Network and convince me to jump in on this exciting project.

Request Netowrk is supported by Y Combinator, the incubator that spawned AirBNB, Stripe, Dropbox, Coinbase, and others.

There is a rumor floating around that, because of the common incubator, Coinbase may one day support Request. Fingers crossed. - Not likely, but man if this happened I'll see you all on the moon.

Request Network gets described as PayPal 2.0: decentralized, inexpensive, secure, hopefully widely accepted throughout the e-commerce system and a bank agnostic way to send funds from peer to peer. 

I've also heard it referred to as the Omise Go of the West. Does anyone remember that small, no name coin called Antshares that was dubbed the ""Ethereum of the East""? Well, that little coin was rebranded as NEO and early holders were rewarded massively.

What a time to be alive. Let's quit worrying about the price action for this first week on the exchanges. We aren't even on any big exchanges yet. Once this coin hits Bittrex or Binance I'm confident we'll crack the top 100 on coinmarketcap.com. Once we are on the first page of Coinmarketcap, that will just further enhance the visibility of this project and therefore increase the price per coin. 

With a current market cap of only $26 Million, We could 4x our price from here and still only be at around $100 Million market cap (or ranked # 63 on Coinmarketcap). 

The future of Request Network is bright folks. Just hodl and reap the rewards for being early :)",NA,"78peub",NA,0,NA,"false",1510478309,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/78peub/im_sure_glad_i_found_this_coin_right_now/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,1

Even to buy Bitcoin we have to pay a huge spread to the one exchange that we currently have which is Luno. So I am thinking instead of paying another fees to change my Bitcoin to Ether before buying REQ , why not buy REQ with bitcoin itself? Do you guys see any risk buying REQ with bitcoin instead of Ether? 

What I am thinking is , let's say REQ goes up in price , but bitcoin is appreciating at the same time as well , doesn't that in a way cause REQ's price to stay stagnant? 

To simplify , let's say 1 bitcoin is worth 8000 USD today , and if we buy 1 bitcoin out REQ , we gets about 160,000 REQ. 

Price for REQ/BTC now is 0.00000593/0.05$ , lets say someday it goes up to 0.0000012 / 0.10$ , we will have to sell our REQ in exchange for bitcoin , but at that time bitcoin might now worth as much as 8000 USD anymore , in that sense do we lose some of our investment gains from REQ?

Granted, there are a lot of shills and people who don't know what they're talking about, however, there are still a few Youtubers who provide some valuable insight.

With that said, with Colossus on the Horizon, I think it will be greatly beneficial for both current and prospective investors to have Request Demo Colossus as well as have an AMA with a 'legit' youtuber. I am sure there are plenty of youtubers that would love to interview Request Network. I think seeing and hearing from the team will improve Investor confidence, clear up any confusion regarding Request platform and will help to draw in new investors.

Request network is currently the talk of the town, and if we can carry this momentum further, nothing like that! We've grown from 1768 subscribers to 3049 subscribers in 20 days. That's a 72.4% growth in 20 days even with the price being below the ICO rate most of the time. This shows how much people are interested in this project, and how much potential this project has.

I'm very happy with the growth of this community and the way things are taking shape, and I hope this growth reflects in the price sooner than later.

In the whitepaper, it says that future decisions will be made by a ""board"" which will be selected sometime in the future. My questions are:

1. how will this board be decided?

2. will there be some clearly defined proof of stake mechanism in place? (similar to Dash's MNO system perhaps?)

3. If not, how are concerns of centralization to be resolved?

Especially as you watch ICOs like POWR (same # of tokens, same ICO price, approx. same ICO time) go 10x within a shorter period of time *and* get listed on big exchanges like Bittrex.

What's preventing REQ from pursuing such listings? I know the standard answer is, ""we're focusing on the product."" But that doesn't sit well with me. Is that to say that projects like POWR are *not* focusing on their product because they achieved a listing on a larger exchange? Or is it to say that they spent all of their time pursuing exchange listings instead of developing? I think anyone who follows their project can say that that's not true. 

I hope the team understands that ICO investors are *not* traditional investors (for numerous reasons), nor should they expect their investment to behave as such--after all, it's not a traditional investment vehicle. In the same way that the team did not expect to conduct their seed round in the traditional way. They got very ""easy,"" very ""free"" money for their project--but ICO investors expect something in return for that. That ""something"" is an honest, transparent understanding of how the team is trying to look out for investor interests--in both the short and long term.

So my concrete question is this: Are big exchanges coming? Yes or no--that's all I want. I don't want timelines, don't want names--just ""yes"" or ""no"".

I see companies like Populous, PayPie, and others with a bigger market cap than REQ, yet REQ does exactly what they can, and more. 

I see multiple comments about how people with req are ""bagholders"" and it is a ""shitcoin"". yet they have not actually researched the product themselves. I see many people think this is a failed project simply because it is below the ico price. Yet I think that is FAR from the case. 

I think request network is going to be the ETH of crypto finance.

Perhaps it could one day be possible to use the Request Network to only pay insurance on your car when it is away from the safety of your home. Or there could be a small trickle payment to cover it from theft or damage at home and then an increased payment kicks in when you are actually using it.

Even better - imagine an insurance marketplace that could automatically choose the best rate for you on a daily basis and depending on the usage status of the car?

I think there are insurance companies out there already that offer a similar tiered structure for Uber drivers etc but would be great to see this approach available to everyone.

In the same way monthly wages don´t suit everyone, neither does having to fork out on large annual expenses like insurance in one hit.

Maybe I´m dreaming and the bureaucratic, legal nightmare of insurance would make this very difficult but it seems to me another industry ripe for disruption that Request could help facilitate through an efficient payment system.

""With the reputation system of Request Network, it is possible for companies (and individuals) to
improve their reputation as 'good payers' by paying their bills on time. This is possible thanks to the
visibility​ and​ ​transparency​ ​allowed by the Blockchain. In addition, the pending invoices and the
financial situation of a company is visible instantly thanks to the Blockchain. This allows the credit
applicant to get an almost instant rating. **Request allows to assign a score to a company or an
individual thanks to a system of reputation updated as regularly as possible.**""

Ok, so I've been delving more deeply into Request, and this is much more than Paypal 2.0. 

Imagine being able to do peer to peer loans, based on Requests reputation system. 

The reasons why I can see this being disruptive is: 

-The borrower may get the funds immediately, instead of 7 or greater days like with Lending Club for example. The interest rates will probably be lower than Lending Club as well, since the middlemen are cut out. This can be advantageous if the borrower is in a pinch and needs money immediately for rent, bond, family emergency etc.

-Continuous payments - Imagine if the loaner is paid daily, instead of monthly. The lender can then use that daily capital to make other investments in cryptocurrency, more loans, etc.

-Bad Credit - This system can also be advantageous for borrowers who have bad credit scores since the loan worthiness can be based on their Request reputation instead.

In a previous post I indicated some of the market sizing for REQ.  This time, I will reach in a little deeper on their new announcements and why most may have missed the point and the inherent value.  

The concepts around Continuous Payments and Continuous Invoicing, would be positioning itself as the disrupter not just to standard STP accounting processes of melding Payment to the AR/AP functions.  It would be an evolutionary step of the Convergent Charging and Invoicing systems currently in place.  

- REQ listed some basic use case scenarios, but these are just the easily digestible examples for most;  
- REQ’s best application is in the B2B and G2B sectors where one-many relationships are highly beneficial for the Buyers (user of their services);  
- REQ has been coy and understated. If their listed horizontal functions are the real target areas – it should be able to position itself as the first legitimate ‘Intelligent Payment’ option that welds payments and invoicing into a singular consistent framework for ANY consumable activity.
- In theory, this would extend into Utilities, Storage, Maintenance, Education and the new task based economy;
- In theory, the issues of cross-border banking become mute – which is the single biggest exploitable price differentiator in accessing global trade.
- In theory, it could position itself very easily as a direct competitor for preferential for Project Payment portals to remove incumbents like Ariba Pay.  

It is pretty clear that REQ is further along than they publicly admit. This is a good thing.  If an outsider can quickly pull the threads of their offer apart and see their massive potential, you can bet why smarter minds like ING (backed) and Ycombinator (backed) are excited to be on board.  

- The project makes too much sense for the now;   
- Is appealing to too many Governments and Businesses to unburden from current systems; and,
- Is needed to meet stricter regulations around reporting and detail in most jurisdictions worldwide

But here's the thing: at this point anyone who wants REQ can get it. If you want it that bad, there's literally nothing preventing you from signing up to Liqui or Binance, or just going to Etherdelta for it. If you're not doing that: you just don't want it that bad. 

What I'm afraid of is that the ICO price was substantially overvalued because 'demand' was artificially inflated through the amount of people investing purely to flip. So the *actual* value is probably around .00012 - .00015 ETH. In other words: I'm afraid that a Bittrex listing will not really make a big difference in price--maybe a quick pump as people get in, thinking it's going to pump--but no 3x, 4x, or 10x.

You'll notice that in the past two weeks, price has peaked on Thursday in anticipation of moon-worthy news. Which, in crypto translates to ""wen bittrex, wen huobi, wen product, or wen big partnership."" But you'll also notice that those peaks are reaching lower highs. This time it was .000189 ETH, two weeks ago it was .00023 ETH--which means peeps are getting tired of REQ's price shenanigans and they're moving on to different, more profitable tokens.

So why should you hodl? Well maybe you shouldn't, REQ might sink lower. But then again REQ can announce bittrex, huobi, Colossus, or a new partnership literally any day...it is not limited to their bi-weekly updates. IIRC, the Binance listing was outside of a bi-weekly update. If you didn't sell on Thursday night, then you *might* be selling the bottom here--or so close to the bottom that you'll just be constantly stressed about missing the rocket launch. The ATL of REQ was about .00011 ETH...we're not too far from there. My advice is to forget about REQ for a while.

There is also **NOTHING** you can do to hasten a Bittrex listing. Do you really? think Bittrex does not have at least one person (more likely a few people) whose responsibility it is to keep an eye out on new ICOs? Of course they are aware of REQ. They don't need your tweets or emails telling them about how awesome REQ is. If it's not listed there yet, then there's a reason for that.

I expect some news about new hires to come out, as well information about larger exchanges. Lastly, we should receive more information about the ING partnership and their extent within Request.


2) Q1 2018: This time period is what really gets me and many investors excited. They expect to have the first iteration of Request working on Ethereum main net (essentially the first full working product). I expect many huge partnerships to be announced during this stage (similar to Omise’s McDonalds partnership). There has been speculation about Amazon due to a screenshot on the website showing a “Pay with Request” button on Amazon’s checkout page, and I believe many more companies will be publicly announced as working with Request as a major payment option. Request’s backend audit and accounting services will be utilized by many companies as well, and I expect some major partnerships regarding that front.


3) Q4 2018 and beyond: Hopefully by this period, Ethereum will have some working iteration of Casper POS protocol, and with that many of us long term hodlers will be able to stake our tokens for POS consensus confirmation of Request payments. This will bring with it many new investors as well as the prospect of a annualized % return based on total network volume on Request Network.


Based on the points discussed above, this stage right now is an AMAZING opportunity to snag REQ tokens. I can guarantee that come Q1 2018, even the base ICO price will look tiny. $300-$400 million market cap will not be out of question with some big partnerships being announced and a growing team. Please ignore the short term FUD and take a look at the roadmap, and what the team is doing. They are AHEAD OF SCHEDULE folks, hodl and relax, because this journey is only just getting started.

I would like to present to you the **cheapest** and best way to buy (or sell if you really want to) request tokens. At the moment, the best trading platform that offers request trading is Binance. This is a very good exchange with currently the lowest market taker commission: you only pay 0.1% trading fee, which is lowered to 0.05% if you hold enough Binance coins (I recommend you do that).

The reason I am sharing this with you today is because I am the admin of [BinanceReferral.com](http://www.binancereferral.com) which is basically a 25% cashback offer on your Binance trading fees. Let me explain how it works (more on my website): We get 50% of your trading fee if you sign up with our link on Binance, and from those 50% we keep 25% and pass 25% to you on a monthly basis, to the ethereum address of your choice. **What used to be the lowest trading fee of 0.05% is now even lower: 0.0375% is what you will effectively pay with our offer!**

Trust is of course paramount here, because you don’t know me and I could be flying away with your referral fees. It’s true, it’s a risk, but we already have 160 members that trust us and some have already received their first cash back payments!  

I hope you will consider registering on Binance with us to buy those sweet REQ tokens! 

If you have any questions or concerns, I will be happy to answer them. ",NA,"7fgviq",NA,0,NA,"false",1512305509,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/7fgviq/cheapest_and_best_way_to_buysell_req/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

 * https://github.com/vrolland/request.js

From browsing these files and the little Solidity/Javascript I know, it looks very completed and ready for deployment in  test phase capacity.

Additionally a branch of master called **Elliotbranch** has been updated within the last 2 hours

1. Buy $ETH using Coinbase or GDAX or your preffered exchange.

2. Head over to Binance (binance.com) and follow these instructions to register and get the ETH address to deposit your newly purchased $ETH (https://support.binance.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000622212-How-to-Register-and-Deposit-on-Binance)

3. Once your ETH is deposited and confirmed, you will see it in 'Deposit Withdrawals'

PRO TIPS:

- If you are planning to hold your $REQ on Binance, add Google Authenticator 2FAC (check your security settings on Binance to add this)
- If not, you can store your $REQ tokens in your Ledger Nano S ETH address or use MyEtherWallet (https://www.myetherwallet.com)

WHAT IS REQUEST NETWORK

“Request is not an app but a financial platform on which many projects can be developed. It is a layer on top of Ethereum simplifying the development of many features in the crypto finance space. We want to structure cryptocurrency payments, finance and accounting areas. Our goal is to build a platform to operate payment requests applicable for every financial flow, and structure it by allowing external systems and software to plug into the platform through the use of our APIs. Thanks to a decentralized payment request, we can recreate all the platforms existing in the FIAT world and apply financial features in the crypto world such as invoicing, salaries, payments and many others.”

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$REQ - Request Network token is available on the following exchanges (note: this guide is only for Binance)

- Binance
- EtherDelta	
- Radar Relay
- Kucoin	
- Liqui
- Gate.io
- Decentrex
- Mercatox
- COSS
- IDEX

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Limit order:** you specify how much of the asset (in this case REQ) you want to buy or sell, and the price you want. If there are matching orders on the book (e.g. someone who wants to sell at the same price, or lower, as the price at which you want to buy), your order will be filled immediately. If not, your order will stay on the book until matching orders arrive (which could be never). (It is also possible for a limit order to be only partially filled)

**Market order:** you only specify how much of the asset you want to trade. Your order is then filled immediately at the best price currently available on the market. For instance, if you place a market buy order, you will be matched with the current lowest-priced sell order on the book. If that order is not large enough to completely fill yours, the next-lowest sell order will be used to fill some more of yours, and so on.

This is something that is close to being on testnet for ETH but I'm going slightly further in the future. 

So let's start with the checkout. There's a pay with Request button next to the pay with PayPal button.

I click on the pay with Request button and a new window opens asking me which currency I would like to pay with. I can choose fiat currency right from my account or any cryptocurrency I have. I can even choose to spend my extra air miles I don't need because they've been tokenised. 

I choose ETH and since I have a Request account set up I sign my details and the request is paid. The retailer however doesn't want ETH, they want to be paid in DOGE. 

So the ETH that I spent goes to the Kyber Network and is exchanged at the going rate for DOGE and sent to the retailer for his payment. A small fraction of the ETH however converts to REQ and that REQ is burned to fuel the transaction.  All done wth neither the buyer or seller touching REQ tokens at all. I can easily make a claim to get my money back if my item arrives damaged as it's held in escrow until the item arrives with me. 

So I paid for my item in my currency of choice, the retailer receives his currency of choice. A tiny fee for this transaction has been paid, which has profited a REQ holder and at the same time contributed to the rising price of REQ as it has increased scarcity by burning. But, the transaction fee never rises as its adjusted to the value and amount of REQ circulating.

So why did I pay with Request and not PayPal? Well obviously I wanted to pay in ETH or any other crypto. I also prefer paying with Request because the money goes right from my account across a trustless network, that means none of my details are held in centralised systems and I have my bank details on the Request network too, where they are safer. The fee is also a fraction of PayPal's which is great for the buyer and amazing for the retailer.

There are limitless other use cases for the Request network, this is just a small one but if it becomes Ecommerce standard or even 1% of PayPal currently then it will absolutely huge. 

I'm not that technical of a person and only scratched the surface of this process and it's advantages. So please do correct me or add anything I've missed out!

Is there some kind of downside to listing on bigger exchanges which I am not seeing?  Does it compromise the project in some way?  

If not,  it should be acknowledged that there is a significant upside to listing on them.  The investors will be much less stressed!

* Do you think that REQ should be valued in fiat money and therefore the ratio REQ/ETH should dip in accordance to ETH/EUR or ETH/USD. 
* Or do you think it should be valued in ETH, which means that the ratio should stay the same, except for other influences on the valuation?

Since we are all still paying for most anything in fiat I always measure my portfolio in terms of EUR, but for REQ the ratio to ETH is my main factor to decide how cheap I think it is. My future expectations of ETH vs. REQ are a big deciding factor here.

I personally believe that OmiseGo should be listed here. Sure, both systems apparently could, at least partially, benefit from eachother. But in the end OMG tries to do a lot of things which REQ plans on doing too.

I have seen a few posts discussing Req's competition, but have not seen Dash mentioned at all (search turns up empty).

A friend of mine, who invested heavily into Dash in 2016 and has closely followed their development process, mentioned to me that Dash plans to roll out a beta version of their Evolution platform this quarter and refine it throughout 2018.  From Dash's website, the synopsis reads:

&gt; Evolution’s mission is to make digital cash easy to use and access for all users, even those who aren’t technologically savvy. Anybody will be able to setup an account on the blockchain, add contacts and pay them by name. Purchases from websites or mobile apps will be simple, requiring only a single click.
&gt; 
&gt; In Evolution, you will be able to connect directly with merchants to make purchases or even setup auto debits to pay for subscription services. Every merchant that integrates Dash will be searchable on the blockchain, and you will be able to rate purchases so the community can decide which vendors are providing quality products and services.

From my understanding of Req, this sounds like a very similar goal, trying to fulfill a very similar use-case.  Also, on this and other crypto subs, Req has been called a ""decentralized version of PayPal"" in several flavors: a title that Dash seems to also get tagged with among crypto communities on Reddit and abroad.  I'm currently holding Req, and would like to know what specifically will Req. provide that Dash will not?  Thanks folks.

Interesting read found on the cryptocurrency subreddit. I know we are in struggling period at the moment, but you are probably better off just holding a coin that has never 'mooned' instead of selling at a loss and chasing coins that you think have more 'moon' potential. Here is one of the replies I found interesting:

""As an investor in stocks, traditional/insurance based investments, real estate and crypto, i can say that 95% of my wealth is made by holding patiently while 90% of my losses are made on knee jerk day trade opportunities.
when i got into crypto around a year back i used to try absolutely dumb shit like short bitcoin after a rally etc. all of those proved to be extremely painful lessons in the long run.
for the last 7-8 months i have only held btc and couple of other HV cryptos and they have proven to be complete winners more than any day trade could ever do""

I too have made bad trades looking to gain profit and have only been burned. Selling poor performing coins at losses only to have that coin's price go up over time has happened as well. It is the worst feeling knowing that if I had just held on another week or so I could've been swimming in profit.  And this something that will more than likely happen with Request. No more selling at losses for me, as Warren Buffet said(which is also applicable to crypto imo):

""The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.""

We need a community of HODL'ers and not a toxic community of FUD'ders and dumpers. We need compelling reasons to HODL REQ and not dump it into oblivion. This only hurts us all in the long run. A coin of this caliber should not be thrown in the trash.

Here are my top reasons on why I am holding REQ.

1)**Token burning** - The way I understand it, REQ tokens are burned with each transaction. This means REQ tokens will automatically appreciate in value. This alone is worth HODLing REQ tokens.

2)**Currency Agnostic/Mass Adoption** - The game changer for me is the fact that REQ can be used with fiat. The problem with most dApps is they are tightly coupled with cryptocurrency, and crypto isn't quite mass adopted yet. Joe six pack can use Request with fiat because of it's lower fee's over Paypal's and not care about the 'blockchain magic' that's going on beneath the hood. If normies start using Request, you know what that means? **Mass Adoption!**

3)**REQ is backed by Y-Combinator** - Need I say more? **Y-Combinator is the Harvard of startup accelerators**. As a matter of fact **Y-Combinator is harder to get into than Harvard!** If REQ is being backed by these guys, then obviously they are doing something right. Remember Y-Combinator has backed Reddit, Coinbase, Airbnb and Dropbox to name a few. Ironically, if it weren't for Coinbase or Reddit, I probably would'nt even be into crytpo.

4) **We're already as low as we can get.** Every coin has its day. There are tons of sh#tcoins that have 2x'ed, 3x'ed with time and don't have a fraction of the awesome use cases that Request has. If you get in now, rest assured that the only way we can go is up. If you guys have seen REQ ambitious roadmap, you know that once this baby gets rolling, it's going to be too late to jump in if aren't in already. **Do you really want to be the 'guy' that sold all his Request tokens the week before it mooned? Or the guy that sat on the sidelines while this coin was sitting under ico price?** Yeah, don't be that guy.

5)**Colossus** - This is only a FEW weeks away guys. I mean, if you can't HODL for a few weeks, then just stop investing. Everyone in crypto thinks they are entitled to a 10x overnight. Even the most successful ico's of all time took time. Imagine if you sold all your ETH one month after the Ethereum ico! Anyway, REQ is delivering a site, that will actually be useful, in less than a FEW WEEKS.

6)**Fee's** - REQ token holders we will receive 0.1 - 0.5% of the fees. So this along with the token burning is an easy way to make passive income. I mean it just doesn't get any better than this.

7)**Request is a Platform** - If we look at the most successful ico's of recent memory, Ethereum, Stratis, NEO, LISK, etc they are all platforms. There is a common misconception that Request is a just another dApp but that is not the case. 

There are a lot of other reasons, that I might add on later. But feel free to add to this list. 

I think sometimes Investors forget why they invested in Request and sometimes we need to be reminded of the potential of this coin. Like I said other coins have mooned doing much less. We're next up to bat!

TL;DR - Request has so much potential. It's better to HODL because the positives far exceed the negatives. We already hit rock bottom and can only go up. This coin is literally a ticking timebomb ready to blow up.

Right before the BTC Gold fork, there was a massive liquidation of Request tokens, even below pre-ico price(as low as .03) that absolutely destroyed the value of the token. 

There may be another BTC Fork(Bitcoin Silver) in December and another one(possibly Segwit2x will try again) in January. 

Given the history of bad timing with Request and BTC forks, is it possible for the team to at least time the date of any kind of release to avoid a conflict with a BTC Fork(maybe having a release the day after a Fork, instead of a week before a Fork)?

 I think this will be very beneficial to both investors and for the Request team, as we know, BTC is king and any news/forks surrounding it will trump any news/developments from 'alts'. We were already burned badly by BTC Forks in the past and I would hate for the same thing to happen again.

- All the team members are working on Moneytis and Request at the same time. It is unclear how the team allocates their time between the two projects.

- Since peer to peer payment is the backbone of cryptocurrency, the project faces competition from many blockchain projects in one way or another: Status, Metal, Monetha, OmiseGO, Everex, TenX, Monaco, Centra, Token Card, Pillar, and many others.

- 20,000 Ether was sold to early investors and strategic partners with 20% bonus (this is not part of the 100,000 ETH hard cap).

I don't plan on selling any of my Request for at least a year. 

So, after today, it has dawned upon me that Request should be more proactive in expanding awareness of Request -- probably through a newly hired community/social media manager. 
I was in contact with two exchanges today: Bit-Z and OKEx. Why I approached these exchanges? I was contacted by a few Chinese friends who wanted to buy REQ, but couldn't because Binance has banned Chinese from trading, and they prefer using an established Chinese exchange with decent liquidity, like Bit-Z. Neither exchange had awareness of REQ; Bit-Z told me to email them a description of REQ, and OKEx actually thought I was asking about the network statistics of their exchange when I inquired about possibly adding REQ. 

I know the Request team doesn't care about raising the price of the token, and that's good. But I believe the team should work on their exposure in the crypto space, to help increase the awareness of Request's goals and to build more potential partnerships (partnerships take time, and it's a good idea to build relationships with businesses sooner rather than later). I'm aware that the team has commented on exchanges and won't talk more about them, but I was a little disappointed that the two exchanges I approached today weren't already approached before. More exchanges brings about more awareness for Request, and also more potential clients. 

I also know that the team is very busy, which is why I believe it crucial that all of the marketing/reaching out to businesses is done through an experienced community manager.

In any case, the Request team is probably the most transparent I've ever come across, and this is why it is my favorite community in the cryptosphere. 
This post is just my two cents worth; not a demand nor criticism. I'm also sure that many other Request fans feel the same way. Thanks for reading.

Hopefully some others may feel the same way.

I am Req holder but a crypto trader moreso.

My opinion is that these planned updates are too structured and are holding the token back. While I understand the team shouldnt care about the token value they should want their investors to feel as comfortable as possible holding the token.

The main drawback with planned fortnightly updates is the buy the rumour sell the news mentality. There is no incentive to hold on to my coins, I know I could sell the news today and buy back in a weeks time at a minimum 20% discount.

The fortnightly update should not be used to announce news, it should be a recap of the previous 2 weeks work. Sometimes news should come out at random times. If you make a deal with Kyber you should announce it when its finalized, not wait till your set dates. If you have a breakthrough announce it on Twitter, get people interested.

At the minute it feels like there is 0 chance of any announcements until the next update. Req seems to have no buzz until 2 days before the update, then it dies off straight afterwards.

But I have questions regarding the answers from the recent Q&amp;A. 

&amp;nbsp;

**(quotes taken from responses on the Q&amp;A)**

&amp;nbsp;

My understanding on token use case: 

&amp;nbsp;

Request tokens are required on every transaction and burnt ""as part of the verification that a transaction has occurred"".

&amp;nbsp;

Regarding staking:

&amp;nbsp;

""Not yet. It is **all** dependent on the development of technology on the Ethereum Network, Plasma and Sharding in particular.""

&amp;nbsp;

My question: Why is PoS entirely dependent on the development on Plasma? 

&amp;nbsp;

My gripe with the current REQ system is this. PoS shouldn't be implemented **only if** Plasma is a success. It should be an **integral** part of the 'network effect', **Plasma or not**. The lack of PoS paired with, ""anyone can use the Request Network and they don’t need request tokens to use it."", isn't very re-assuring at all.

&amp;nbsp;

Without PoS:
REQ gets some early adoption, Company X uses Request.
Company X pays $2,000 USD in transaction fees to do get some ""auditing"" done.
In Crypto terms: REQ tokens are burnt
In FIAT terms: $2000 USD is gained by Request.

&amp;nbsp;

Unless some amount of the $2000 USD to used to 're-buy' the REQ used for burning, the price of REQ is purely reliant on whale pumps and greater fools picking up tokens that only use case is: burning.

&amp;nbsp;

If PoS is not a sure thing, there will be no use for tokens to secure the network nor collect fees. All there is essentially a burning stack of virtual tokens that exist on a blockchain with no financial incentive to encourage holding.

&amp;nbsp;

Theoretically speaking, if PoS is not implemented, REQ as a token doesn't even need to exist. The Request network would still be able to sell auditing services, or still be a paypal clone with private transaction ledger. 

&amp;nbsp;

It's fine that crypto is speculative. ROI is never a sure thing. The road to mass adoption is already tough enough, why should PoS, which is a development effort that can be decided by the team be based on an ""If"" on another project. When ironically, ""If not"", we're essentially left with praying that ""Burning the tokens could potentially increase the demand on the remaining REQ tokens"" (quoted from the white paper).

I've been in the ICO 'scene' for the last 6 months and I can't tell you how many people fall for these scams. It is very sad.

Can't all of this be alleviated by ICO's leveraging Request's api?

For example, once an ICO has all of the contributors ETH addresses, can't the ICO simply send a Request to all the of the registered participants? If that's the case, this will mitigate fraud and simplify the convoluted ICO process...Could be a game changer if ICO's can embrace this. This is an awesome use case if possible.

That's it guys.  Request team is pretty much done here.  

They're back to the cubicles working on their project.  Sorry.  No resources allocated to finding and actively pursuing listing on new exchanges.  Nobody hired to do any PR or marketing of any kind.  

""Keep paying attention to them for the long term vision""  (lol) ... means they're doing nothing now, and for the forseeable future.  

So where does that leave investors?   

Bag holding for months, possibly years longer.   Any BTC or ETH you sold to invest in REQ will now be tied up indefinitely, as their token price sits BELOW ICO PRICE for who knows how long.  

I am really unhappy with this situation.  Its clear to me that the Request team had zero post-ICO plan of any kind.  This is in comparison to projects like PowerLedger which also went live around the same time.  They knew the value of their investors, and had an active post-ICO checklist underway.  

They put in the time and effort and got listed on 6 exchanges, and ultimately Bitfinex (Bittrex?).  As a result, their token has more than tripled in value, while REQ flounders 30% below ICO price with literally no plans or future in sight.

Found an interesting diagram detailing how YC startups invest and support one another. Here are a few excerpts:

""For example, founders from 2009's WePay and 2010's Stripe, both finance startups, advise GiftRocket, a service that launched last year to let anyone create a gift card for any business.

Also, Y Combinator companies boost one another's businesses as customers. Most popular: Startup-friendly tools such as Dropbox or ZeroCater, a meal-delivery service that boasts 8% of its client base from YC alumni.""


With Request being the first ICO to come out of YC, I'm sure it has a lot of visibility within the network of startups. Aside from Coinbase, imagine the relationships that Request can build from this powerful network. As you can see, Request has also partnered with Quantstamp, another YC startup. 

(**Quanstamp was also spotted at Coinbase last week:**

Looking forward to hearing updates with Request potentially partnering with other startups in the YC community!

While this may be true, I want to highlight an aspect that I believe will be a huge benefit when implemented to the masses: Auditing

I've seen a few posts mention it, but not into any depth on why this is so important. As a recent accounting graduate and through my (limited) experience, many small businesses have problems with their invoicing systems, and many entrepreneurs would like the start their own business, but are afraid of the accounting and invoicing processes.

Request seems to be solving these issues, making the invoicing process a lot more organized, allowing integration with switching accounting providers, and they deal with most of the technical jargon of tax work that headache many hands on business owners.

Now that is just me looking at the small business perspective, when it comes to the Big 4 firms and other major accounting firms, Request would be an excellent companion with smart audit algorithm and allow transparency which in turn will help with accuracy and dissuade any financial misrepresentation by an organization.

I appreciate the enthusiasm but at best this is shallow content that opens up these posters to attacks or phishing. It's not safe or responsible to publicly broadcast what you're holding. It encourages bad behavior to allow this.

At worst though this is also going to hurt the project. REQ already has a reputation for being shilled and many of these newcomers openly admit they barely did any research before jumping on the bandwagon. One recent post literally says in the title that they didn't bother doing their homework. I've seen comments from people putting shit on credit cards. This all makes REQ, and this sub, look bad.

I'm trying to get a better grasp of REQ, it's capabilities, and its limitations. I know that in the whitepaper you state that Sharding is one of the necessary Ethereum innovations required. Then it mentions that Sharding is quite a distance away so you will build on Plasma/State Channel's like Raiden.

I read somewhere that Sharding is only capable of increasing the Ethereum tx/s to 4000. Isn't the Sharding solution by itself not enough to process REQ's projected multi-currency transaction volume? So does this somewhat suggest that the  success of REQ in terms of transaction volume depend entirely on Plasma (OMG)/State Channel (Raiden)? 

Do you plan on building on top of both of these or is it an either or situation?

Has development already begun with building ontop of Plasma/Raiden? I know that both of these products are still in the infancy (is this statement even true?). Wouldn't this make developing ontop of these solutions difficult? 

Or are you building the core REQ product and having it interface later with Ethereum's 2nd layer solutions a relatively simply task?

I like the idea of being able to use escrow, but for me it’s not clear yet how disputes regarding the quality of goods will be handled. Could anyone clarify this for me with a practical example?

Related to this is the sellers payment history. If I understand correctly, it will be visible how many requests have been paid for by a user, is that so? Is it like a credit score, for example a percentage that shows how many transactions have been, and have not been paid by a specific user? Will this be visible in some kind of dashboard, or on the website? If such a credit score-like rating exists on the request network, then how is that calculated? And is it possible to abuse this system? Can you send a user a high number of requests for large amounts of money, which are unwarranted, to a user, with the sole purpose of lowering another user’s payback rating? Will a request only be counting towards this score if the request is accepted? Will it then be easy to circumvent a bad score by not accepting requests? Will it be possible to accept a request while not having enough funds?

I read their white paper, and this seems like an extremely ambitious project with a decent chance of success (assuming they secure the necessary partnerships). My impression is that the Request Network intends to be adopted by retailers like amazon, who will use the Network to create invoices and receive payments from their customers. The white paper said that participants (I'm assuming in this case would be amazon) would purchase the token to pay Network fees. They also said that users generally wouldn't need to purchase tokens. Then I read that all tokens spent on network fees would be burned. 

So my questions are:
1. Am I correct in assuming that retailers or businesses that use the network to receive payments will be the ones paying network fees, and thus the ones purchasing the tokens? 
2. Does anybody know at this point if new tokens can be created, since tokens will constantly be burned?
3. The supply of REQ isn't huge. What would stop a massive company like amazon from buying every single token and just sitting on them, preventing other companies from accumulating enough to use the network? I know this would be illogical but it's still very doable so I was wondering if there are any measures to prevent this from happening.

Typically this strategy is done to ward off so-called bull runs, and accumulation is done in a very passive, consistent manner as to not move the market.  The sale lots are large to prevent any price run-ups in the short term.

This suggests good news that whales even believe in the potential of REQ to the degree others in this community do, myself included.

Second Q: what other cryptos can REQ be paired with to create the ultimate suite of tools for businesses worldwide?

2. /u/HackerMcStealYoCash is paying attention and notices that  Johnny has a nice stack. He's looking for a payday so he's identified a target.
3. Through some careful post-history browsing, maybe a little bit of hacking, our Mr. Steal Yo Cash has identified Johnny's twitter/pinterest/instagram/whatever account--which has led him to Johnny's email address.
4. Hacker-man now reverse engineer's Johnny's email password by calling support and pretending to be a very desperate Johnny who's phone got stolen and is locked out of his account.
5. Gaining access to Johnny's email, he resets Johnny's Binance password and makes a grab for the coins.
6. Johnny is refreshing his blockfolio and cracking open the champagne as REQ surpasses $0.40. Thinks he'll sell a couple to pay for that champagne...

But oh no! While Johnny has been counting his coins, Hackerman has been stealing them! Boom. Johnny cries.


Obviously there are a lot of details missing here folks--2FA, *how* a hacker might break into your account or phish your details or a number of other things--don't miss the forest for the trees here.

I've seen several users throw around their stack size in the daily discussion just for kicks and giggles, and you guys need to realize that, although you are pretty sure you're safe from being victim to an attack, you really should not put a giant Bull's Eye on your back.

In my personal opinion, I believe that a mobile Request application is critical to the success of this project, at least in terms of one that will lead to mass adoption.

I do believe that Request will be successful, and the team (excuse the french), but I think a mobile app in a similar fashion to Venmo is critical for mass adoption intentions.

Anyways, here's my question for the community.

Assuming there is a future mobile application planned, would you want the dev team to official develop and build the app, market it (along with the community), etc. Or would you rather it just be a community led open source mobile app?

The community does seem to be growing quite large very quickly, almost 10K subs, and we're still very early on.

If I register to REQ I give my personal bankdata to the network? So if I'm accepting a request, the network forces a payment from my bank. But that's still unsecure because the bank can cancel the transaction for many reasons and it's not fast.

I have narrowed it down to a few coins where I will spend my Christmas bonus. 

I am somewhat new to altcoin trading, and after looking at the supply of REQ at 640m, it is certainly obvious that it will not be the next BTC or ETH. 

However it seems rather strange to me, the idea atleast, that BTC or ETH would ever actually be used as a currency instead of a store of value. I do not believe for a second that people will ever want to walk into 7/11 and buy a slurpee for 0.00000040 BTC or 40 satoshi. I guess my question is what are the implications of REQ becoming an accepted payment method at bed bath and beyond, walmart or even your local car dealership? Does this mean those who hold large amounts of this currency (ie. HODLers who bought large amounts early on) would suddenly have the means to be essentially ""wealthy"" or ""well off.""

If (and in my opinion, when) fiat crashes, is it realistic to think that people will begin accepting other forms of currency given that in Canada NFC payments are absolutely widespread and very rarely do I use anything other than Apple Pay these days.

I understand this is a REQ subreddit so I am unlikely to find skeptics around here, but what are the realistic scenarios that anyone sees happening? Does REQ slowly gather some partnerships in small coffee shops, then gain momentum until large retail chains or even eCommerce websites begin accepting REQ? Does REQ rise to 5$ or even 10$ a coin?",NA,"7m5ntl",NA,0,NA,"false",1515377289,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","false","linkflairlabel","","false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/7m5ntl/is_it_too_late_to_hop_on_this_train/",NA,"",NA,"Discussion","",0,1

I've only been researching this for a little bit today so I don't have a full understanding by any means.  I'm sure there is a lot more reading I should do and plan to do but I'm not seeing it yet as revolutionary as it's made out to sound.  How is this any different than Google Wallet/Venmo but on a scale that everyone has it and it's linked up to everything you buy so that you can request payment from others/split payment with others?  They say they're eliminating the 3rd party, but wouldn't Request itself be a 3rd party just like Paypal, Venmo, and others?  This topic is very fresh to me and I don't want to offend anyone posting here but I'm purely trying to grasp the idea of it.  

Is the end goal to use REQ as a currency (just like Bitcoin and other cryptos)? People seem to be buying into REQ as an investment but the ways I have seen it explained makes me think it's just a platform to use for trading currency (USD, euro, etc.)

What happened this week?

During this period we opened at 1748 satoshis and saw a sell-off down to 1486 sat market price and trading as low as 1250 sat.

Immediately after which we saw a rise to 1919 sat, a small dip and a continued climb to 1947 sat.  After which start at 4 AM EST on Dec 21st we saw a gradual downtrend towards 1596 sat at 11:30 AM EST on Dec 22nd. 

From that point up until 2-2:30 PM on Dec 25th we climbed continually 2074 sat and saw a pump all the way to the current high of 2766 sat.  After this we saw a rather predictable 70% pull back and then we-traced back to our current price of 2434 sat (as of 4:58 PM EST Dec 29).

What can we surmise?

1. General trend is showing very bullish, if history repeats itself and it always does in this market we should see a new high achieved in the next 1-3 days.

2.  After the pull back from the large pump on the 25th we achieved continually increasing bottom support levels, and after the small increase earlier today we appear to be forming a new baseline around 2200 sat.  The next few hours will confirm or deny this hypothesis.

3.  Presently upper resistance was seen at 2490 sat, however the sell wall preventing further gains is only 148,639 REQ tokens.  The resistance seen today was likely due to low volume in general and not actual lack of support for a higher price.

4. Estimated new low can be expected at around 2100 sat, if you sold at the previous rise earlier today look to buy in then, but keep on eye on that triangle which appears to be forming noted with the thick green lines.  If that trend continues over the next 6-12 hours there is very likely to be a large increase in value.",NA,"7mxelj",NA,0,NA,"false",1515392330,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","false","linkflairlabel","","false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/7mxelj/req_trend_analysis_dec_20th_dec_29th/",NA,"",NA,"Info","",0,1

My question is how exactly will the *""Pay with Request""* buttons work?  Will you actually be able to pay with your credit/debit card using Request?  If so, how?
    
I've heard many times that Request is making this possible but *I still don't understand how.*  Someone please enlighten me on the technology.
    
Also.. what about **taxes?** If someone pays you in *dollars* and you accept them in *BTC*, I guess we assume REQ has integrated with a business's accounting software? So the taxable income would be calculated and documented at the dollar amount? 

What's stopping a business from simply *not reporting* this income?

Conversely, tax calculations going from **crypto &gt; FIAT** seem like they'd be even more complicated. 
e.g. How does REQ know your cost basis and how long you've held the crypto you sold for FIAT? 

**No FUD here.. Just a genuine curiosity for these things.**  REQ is *by far* my favorite project in the crypto space and I'm a huge believer.
    

**Summary of questions:**

## **How simple is the Pay With Request button**

- Hypothetically, could a customer Pay With Request via a credit card and the business still receive it crypto? Or, even better... **can a customer pay with FIAT and the business owner receive in FIAT?** and with a credit card? If so, how? This is huge because it would eliminate 3% credit card processing fee.
    

## **What about taxes?**

- I love tax avoidance as much as anyone.. but *let's be real*. If a crypto project can effectively collect or at least document taxes, then the legitimizing effect is massive.  People will trust a crypto that's willing to work with the system, not around/against it.  
    
**The IRS and other government agencies *may* actually even be supportive (lol)...** One can dream.

So how will taxes work on REQ? Does it require a business to self report any income processed via Request? Or is REQ gonna report everyone business's income to the IRS with 1099's? Will they restrict the Pay With Request button to only be allowed for businesses who provide a Tax ID?

I decided to build an Unofficial F.A.Q by the community, and for the community. Please not that I am not a part of the Request team, and most of the answers to the questions have been taken from Whitepaper's/AMA from the Request Team. If there is anything erroneous in the FAQ please let me know. Also if you have any additional Questions and Answers you wish to add let me know and I will add it.

&amp;nbsp;

**What real life solutions is Request trying to solve?**
&amp;nbsp;

""Request is a decentralized network that allows anyone to request a payment (a Request Invoice)for which the
recipient can pay in a secure way. All of the information is stored in a decentralized authentic ledger. **This
results in cheaper, easier, and more secure payments, and it allows for a wide range of automation possibilities.**
To become the backbone of world trade, Request integrates a general ledger (in the accounting sense of
the term), which is:
- Universal because it is designed to support 100% of global transactions, regardless of currency, legislation
or language. Request is built to last.
- Smart because unlike an existing standard accounting book, Request is at the origin of the exchanges and
integrates a computerized trade code, as well as the management of a multitude of payment terms.
Today, their absence makes the whole system inefficient and absolutely unready for the digital and IoT
(Internet Of Things) revolution that is taking place.
Request can be seen as a layer on top of Ethereum
, which allows requests for payments that satisfy a
legal framework.It is also possible to see currencies as tools to complete Request transactions. In this sense,
Request is more global than any currency""
&amp;nbsp;

https://request.network/assets/pdf/request_whitepaper.pdf
&amp;nbsp;

**Also, here is a list of third parties involved or impacted by Request and the reasons why:**
&amp;nbsp;

**Companies**:​ ​Request brings an instant payment solution for suppliers, it facilitates payments
(no need to send the invoice and payment conditions by email or by post). It also brings the
traceability of payment (payment-related billing). Request brings a simplified payment
solution for customers (known payment information), a cheaper system, and a more secure
system.
&amp;nbsp;

**Individuals​**: they can do simplified payments (payment information known, no need to
initiate a payment anymore but only to validate a Request), a secure payment (unshared
banking information), a cheaper payment (no need to go through a third party like Paypal,
Stripe, Bitpay that takes between 1% and 7% charge)
&amp;nbsp;

**Billing​ ​software​:** payment management, interoperability (common database used).
&amp;nbsp;

**Accounting​ ​software​:** simplicity (automation), immutability (common database), accuracy,
authenticity (a decrease in human errors), traceability of invoices and payments
(reconciliation), triple-entry system.
&amp;nbsp;

**Audit​ ​firms​:** a better support for audit, elimination or improvement of certain tests.
States​ ​and​ ​Governments​: accuracy of tax declarations, reduction of fraud, money
laundering, possibility of taxes collection in real time, transparency and legitimacy.
&amp;nbsp;

**Associations​ ​and​ ​NGOs​:** transparency of their expenditure, legitimacy and trust.
&amp;nbsp;

**Citizens​:** knowledge of government budgets and expenditures, transparency of institutions.
&amp;nbsp;

**Employees​**: knowledge of financial health of a company.
&amp;nbsp;

**IoT​:** Request provides a framework for inter-machines payment

**What is the difference between Request and OmiseGO** - ""Request Network has been compared with OmiseGo, however, we have many differences and we are more complementary than competitors.""

https://blog.request.network/omisego-vs-request-network-a-detailed-analysis-779d1f66675b


&amp;nbsp;

**What is the Utility of the Request Token? Why Can't Request just use Ethereum for fee's?**
""While it is built on the blockchain ledger of Ethereum, **Request aims to be independent from other currencies,
monetary policies, or technological choices so that we build the most robust system possible**. We believe this
is the key to evolve through time with a growing community and develop an ecosystem around our framework
where more DAPP (Decentralized applications) are created.

REQ tokens are ERC20 tokens which are necessary to participate in the network, create advanced Requests
and reward various parties who will help build the request ecosystem.
When using the network, the participants will need to pay a network fee in REQ which will be burned.""

In addtion to fee's, there will also be use case for Governance:

""Request will have to remain flexible and scalable, this being one of the major challenges of
decentralized systems (as we can see with Bitcoin Segwit, or the Ethereum management of Ice age ...). **We
wish to separate the governance of our community from the one of Ethereum and avoid a sub-governance
that would allow every Ethereum token holders to decide on the future of this community.**
.
The REQ token will bring the community together and allow for discussions and votes on future decisions.
The community will be a board and we will create the necessary tools for this administration: A voting
system, but also probably a chat system restricted to only members of this board""

&amp;nbsp;

**When Bittrex?!?!?!?!**
This is a commonly asked question, I know that everyone hopes that REQ lands on Bittrex soon. Here was the response by
the team:

""The confidentiality policies we have with exchanges are important to us and we want to respect them. 
**We know how important exchanges are to the Request ecosystem** and we will keep paying attention 
to them for the long-term vision of the project.""
https://blog.request.network/request-network-project-update-november-10th-2017-a57193780ddf


&amp;nbsp;

**What is the purpose of the Token Burn?**
Think of REQ tokens like Gas for the Etheruem network. For each action that is conducted on the Ethereum Platform,
gas is used for the fee's. This helps to keep the platform remain stable and prevent congestion. The same can be said for Request Network.
The token burn will also adjust overtime and also reduce the circulating supply of tokens over time, making this very lucrative
to early investors.


&amp;nbsp;

**Won't Request eventually run out of Tokens if they are burned?**
 REQ has 18 decimals so in theory if the price was incredibly high the fees could be as low as 0.00000000000000001 REQ per transaction which is incredibly low. 
 It would take an extraordinarily long time (even with mass adoption) to be worrying about a lack of REQ tokens, even then a fork can happen.


&amp;nbsp;
 
**When will Request Network Go Live?**
Q1 2018, the first iteration of Request working with Ethereum on Main Net will be live. 


&amp;nbsp;

**Who is Request Network's competition? What advantages does Request have over them?**

**Paypal** - One of the largest worldwide online payments system, suppoting online money transfers to anyone.

**OmiseGo** - Plasma decentralized exchange, 
hosting an open-source digital wallet platform from Omise, connecting mainstream payments, 
cross-border remittances, and much more. Fiat &amp; crypto-friendly, cross-chain compatible, Ethereum-powered, 
and built on plasma.io) : MarketCap - 868 million

**Populous**(Invoice Discointing platform) : MarketCap - 467 million

**MetalPay**(Aims to be a Paypal for crypto): MarketCap - 93 million

**Ten-X** (Cryptocurrency payment platform that consists of a wallet, physical debit card, bank account, ATM access, and more). Marketcap - 250 million

**Monetha**(Mix of Paypal and TrustPilot) : Market Cap had went up to 80 million, but has dropped significantly to 14 million.

**Paypie**(Credit risk assement/Blockchain Accounting) : MarketCap - 66 million

**What makes Request different?**
Request is platform that developers can build decentralized apps for salary management, financial, invoicing and
auditing services, to name a few. A 'decentralized Paypal' is only one of it's many use cases. A employer using 'Continuous Payments'
to pay their employees every day, instead of every two weeks is another use case. Crowdfunding, donations, loans, are more use cases.
**Request has provided a mind map for all of the developments possible on top of Request once the Core protocol is finished by the team.**
It can be viewed here:
 https://blog.request.network/request-network-project-update-november-24th-2017-tech-ecosystem-request-core-kyber-network-b760637eba9b

Several of the competitors are limited to  only one or a few use cases. Also most of the competition is not an open platform like Request, and won't allow third parties to build app's on the platform. Think of Request as 'Ethereum' but for financial applications. 
In regards to Paypal, the fee's will be very minimal, and if Request is integrated into sites like Amazon, Overstock, etc, this will make Request a huge threat to Paypal.

&amp;nbsp;
Also, you may have heard Paypal was compromised. Request will protect the end user by keeping their payment details private and secure.

&amp;nbsp;

**What is Colossus and why is it important?**
Colossus is the first deliverable of the Request Network. Prior to Colossus, there has not been a release.
This release will seperate Request from other hyped ico's with no product. This will also give developers 
access to the Request API's allowing them to build decentralized applications on top of the platform.


&amp;nbsp;

**What previous Projects have the team worked on, and were they successful?**
The most recent project the team worked on was Moneytis. Moneytis was well reviewed and has proven profitiable
for the team, making it a success. More details found here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/RequestNetwork/comments/7eihg9/moneytis_the_project_the_team_launched_before/


&amp;nbsp;

**Why has the team stopped working on Moneytis?**
The team has 'pivoted' from Moneytis, to focus on Request. 
""A pivot is healthy in the life of a startup and shows that you can stay focused on what is really needed by the customers.
In our case, the real need of people who transferred money internationally was always to pay an invoice 
(or a request) and we had to solve the problem at the root.""

&amp;nbsp;

**Where and how can I buy Request tokens?**
An excellent post has been created here detailing on how you can buy Request tokens.

https://www.reddit.com/r/RequestNetwork/comments/7gewy6/how_to_buy_req_request_network_token/


&amp;nbsp;

**What is Y-Combinator, and why is Request being backed by them a good thing?**
Y-Combinator is top accelerator in the world. They have backed Reddit, Coinbase, Dropbox, Airbnb and several more
successful startups. Y-Combinator has an acceptance rate that is lower than Harvard, so investors in Request can 
rest assured that the team is competent and this is not a 'scam'. Also being backed by YC makes Request Network a part of 
strong network of over 1000 startups. Request Network can be found in the list of YC backed companies here:
http://yclist.com/


&amp;nbsp;

**Why is the partnership with Kyber Network a Big Deal?**
""The partnership with Kyber allows the Request Network to never require the Requestor 
or the Payer to hold any Request tokens or participate in manual cryptocurrency conversions, 
as this is all automated by the Request Contract. This is very important as Request’s focus 
has always been to ensure that they are expanding on their ability to reach the widest possible userbase. 
Eliminating the requirement to ever hold Request tokens for both the Requestor and the Payer, the Request Network becomes more accessible""
http://spec-rationality.com/request-network/#29Nov


&amp;nbsp;

**Why should I invest in Request? What makes this a better option than other Cryptocurrencies?**
The way investors typically make a lot of money in cryptocurrecy is by investing in ""undervalued cryptocurrencies"".
What is meant by undervalued? Undervalued typically means a crypto with a small to medium Marketcap (Request at the time of this
writing is around 45 million, most of Request's competition is valued over 100 million) with a great team, great idea and clear roadmap.
Request meets the criteria of having a medium market cap with a great team and vision. Request will probably be in the 100's of million
marketcap by next year if the team can deliver and form partnerships. This makes Request an excellent crypto to invest in for the next 
few months.

&amp;nbsp;

**Does Request have it's own blockchain?**
Request is an ERC20 token built on the Ethereum blockchain, it doesn't use it's own blockchain.


&amp;nbsp;

**What is the connection with ING bank, how did they get involved and it what way do they support the project?**
""ING is an early backer and advises the team frequently. We share common interests and we will see if 
 the executive department of ING is interested in working with Request in the future.""
 https://blog.request.network/request-network-project-update-november-10th-2017-a57193780ddf


&amp;nbsp;
 
**Why should I hold request network tokens? Do i need them to utilize the tech?**
If you are a developer planning build a Gateway, yes you will need tokens to cover the fee's. From an End User
perspective, you will not have to worry about purchasing Request tokens. From an Investor perspective, holding tokens
may be very lucrative if Request Network grows, which will cause a higher demand for the tokens, which will in turn
cause the value of the tokens to increase.",NA,"7hdd2i",NA,0,NA,"false",1512344497,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","true","","","false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/7hdd2i/unofficial_request_network_faq/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

&amp;nbsp;


However, it seems most aren't clear on what the Colossus Release is, and what impact it will have.

So let's clear a few things up:

&amp;nbsp;

First of all, Colossus is just a 'codename' for a set of deliverables.

Per Request team,  here are the deliverables for the Colossus release:

&amp;nbsp;

**Token Launch**  - Done, the ICO concluded in October.

&amp;nbsp;

**First Release of Request working with Ethereum in Test Net** - Still pending, release can happen any day now.

&amp;nbsp;

**Release of Javascript library to create, read and update Requests** - Still pending, release can happen any day now. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Release of the technical papers discussing architecture, upgrades and accounting implementation details** - I think this maybe referring to the white and yellow papers that have already been released?

&amp;nbsp;

**Deploy the website to create, visualize and interact with Requests** - This is ahead of schedule and can also release any day.

&amp;nbsp;

**Add Request management of accounting concepts such as refund, credit note and purchase orders** - This is also ahead of schedule and can also release any day.

&amp;nbsp;

The two biggest deliverables in my opinion are:

&amp;nbsp;

**1.Deploy the website to create, visualize and interact with Requests** This is huge, because this means Request is no longer a 'whitepaper ico'. This means legitimacy for the team and the project. Any ico can have a great whitepaper, but how many of them have actually delivered something? Anything? This places Request Network at a higher level than most ico's. This also gives the cryptoworld an opportunity to play with just one of Request's many many use cases.

&amp;nbsp;

**2.Release of Javascript Library to create, read and update Requests** - This is also huge, because there are developers eager to create dapp's running on top of the Request Platform. I imagine we'll see a lot of creative use cases for Request, and we will see the developer community grow. This will drive excitement and anticipation for the MainNet(Production) release next year.

I'm an auditor. I own Req. 

Unfortunately, the above is completely untrue, and this coin wouldn't abolish the need for auditors. The vast majority of our time (and therefore money) is spent looking over the judgmental areas of the accounts, and also making sure that garbage hasn't gone in (garbage in, garbage out).

We also provide comfort to institutional investors that the numbers are true and fair, and that won't change in the next 50 years. People use us as a trust barrier for their investments. 

Not dissimilar to people wanting the code audited of a cryptocurrency. 

I think that the benefits are mainly around sacking off a lot of the lower paid staff, which is, of course, what companies will do.

Has anyone seen the big giveaways being done in the crypto world?  Request Network should do a holiday giveaway on Twitter to help increase the visibility of REQ. 

Companies do giveaways all the time online to encourage their community to share posts, market, and spread the word about their coins/tokens. REQ should do something like this but say all wallets with over X number of REQ will be eligible to win the airdrop.

I saw a similar post a few days back, but it didn't get as much attention as I thought it should have. I work for a Fortune 20 company and can attest that this is a very legitimate marketing strategy that should at least be considered.

The ICO price of REQ was 0.0002 ETH.

Considering that most ICO 2X or 3X as soon as the tokens hit the market, REQ did not.  Due to largely timing with the Bitcoin bull run and the REQ team not wanting to hype the project, REQ stayed largely under the radar and under ICO price in October and November 2017.

The current price of REQ is 0.00025 ETH which is *ONLY* 1.25X of ICO.  That's after two months of good news and development and being ahead of schedule.

REQ finally made it into the Top100 on coinmarketcap this week.  Finally more people are going take notice of this coin.

Get in early before REQ is 2X or 3X of the ICO price with the Colossus release.

Now we learn that ING does not even want their name associated with the Request project. Some people are speculating that this is due to the legal ambiguity of cryptocurrencies in Europe. But if this is the case, why only now did ING say anything? To me this looks like ING never even knew about Request, and only now realized Request has been claiming there was a partnership that never existed.

I see a huge opportunity to use something like REQ to pay them but my biggest issue is crypto fluctuates so much that the supplier would be taking a huge risk accepting ether or any other crypto as payment because it's too volatile. 

For wide spread adoption doesn't crypto need to stable in order to do any transactional business with it ?

From what I've read REQ will integrate fiat but I'm not entirely sure how that works ? 

I assume you have a USD wallet or its tied to your bank account and then the benefit is low fees and safer transactions? Any idea what the fee would be to transfer 100K ? Wire transfers are super cheap as is ($20-$25) no matter the amount.

So now that Request Colossus has been launched and Q1 2018 is right around the corner, we sould probably look for potential early adopters of the crypto-to-crypto payment interface of Request. I have just learned, that there are many big bullion dealers out there, that are already accepting crypto payments. E.g. SilverGoldBull also accepts payments in ETH, or fiat via PayPal 1.0 - but with PayPal 1.0 you must pay a +4% extra fee!

These bullion dealers have a huge turnover and a customer base that has money to invest. Many of the gold/silver stackers are crypto investors as well and the PM community is starting to gravitate towards crypto, because they have one thing in common: they both foresee an inevitable, major financial crash and the replacement of the current debt-based fiat system.

However, paying by ETH over MEW for example, is probably not the safest feeling right now, especially when someone is paying a relatively larger amount of money for an order. As outlined in the latest official blogpost ""Why use Request"", there are numerous advantages of using the Request Network. I for sure would use Request if I could, and not MEW or some other option. And certainly not PayPal 1.0! :)

Do you think that bullion dealers could be a good candidate for first adopters? Please also feel free to post other ideas and suggestions!

Would it be possible for some sort of ""plugin"" to allow me to sell tokens I receive from payments into USD hourly/daily/weekly? Would there need to be more USD/ETH gateways before this is possible? If theres a way to ""eliminate"" volatility it would be much more widely used. Although im assuming the fees associating with doing this frequently could go against the point of REQ in the first place.

Bit of a naive question but was just brainstorming i guess! Also, my product is $1k+ so an exchange fee each transaction isn't a big deal

They’re a payment processor backed by YC that pretty much came from no where to be a multi billion dollar company.

Before the ‘majority of YC companies fail’ argument pops up - yes the majority of venture capitalist backed companies fail, if you don’t know that obvious and well known fact you shouldn’t be investing at all in my opinion. What it does do is give them the best chance possible for major success as a start up.

Since YC seems to be all about collaboration it seems likely that Request would have the same access to resources that they did coming up, and even more now that Stripe made it big.

It’s incredible that Request are likely to get help from a company like Stripe along the way, and in my opinion it would be a dream for Request to partner with them.

From the front page of the YC site:

&gt; “I doubt that Stripe would have worked without YC. It’s that simple. Acquiring early customers, figuring out who to hire, closing deals with banks, raising money – YC’s partners were closely involved and crucially helpful.”

&gt; Patrick Collison, Founder


Stripe seem an overlooked comparison, I urge anyone interested to look them up. Being the same industry with the same backers makes their story very relevant to Request.

YC state in various places how focussed they are in helping their companies through the network of companies that they already have:

&gt; Because we fund such large numbers of startups, Y Combinator has a huge alumni network, and there’s a strong ethos of helping out fellow YC founders. So whatever your problem, whether you need beta testers, a place to stay in another city, advice about a browser bug, or a connection to a particular company, there’s a good chance someone in the network can help you.


Chances are you’ve probably used Stripe without even knowing. They facilitate cars payments on websites for a much smaller fee than PayPal. So when you choose ‘pay with credit or debit card’ you’re probably going through Stripe. As an online retailer myself I value Stripe way above PayPal for the simple interface and way lower fees (not as low as Request though!). 

I know Stripe’s success doesn’t guarantee anything for Request. But it really gives a sense of what’s possible within the network they are involved in and that can’t be underestimated.

I've bought request tokens when it was 0.08 dollars and I'm reading the threads on reddit ever since. This is my first post because there is one thing that I don't understand.

We all know that you don't need to hold request tokens to make use of the platform. But we hold them anyway because we have trust in the project and strongly believe that it would increase in value. Profit yay! 

But I also read people saying that the value of their REQ will increase because of the REQ burning. Well let's take a look at this with the use of simple supply and demand. 

In the near future REQ is a stable product with a value of, let's say, 5 dollar(just for the math) per token. When you hold 200 tokens worth 1000 dollar. In like a 5 years time 10% of the tokens are burned. That means that also 10% of your REQ is burned(don't it?) . Which means fewer tokens in your portfolio. But these coins will increase in value, let's say by 10%. 

In this case there won't be any profit for the request holder when REQ is burned? Is this how it works?

Imagine streamers are able to have access to their money right away rather than having to wait to withdraw from PayPal. 
It'll create so much flow and transactions because of how many donations and subscribers there are on a daily basis. It'll ultimately lower the fees on each transaction and create such a high volume coin. 

Edit: What can we do to reach out to twitch? Obviously there is still a lot of growth left for the coin and maybe now is not the time, but when can we actually look into it.

There was a pretty good discussion on hacker news about this article

https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/07/patreons-new-service-fee-spurs-concern-that-creators-will-lose-patrons/?hn=1

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15872128

Basically Patreon is taking a bigger cut, basically blaming it on fees for payment processors, making individual, donations more expensive, particularly affecting small donations. This winds up with patrons being charged more, lowering their donations overall, and creators getting less as well.

I think that REQ is perfectly designed for this use case. Creators can get a steady stream of income through REQ, and patrons could give any size donation they want, and cutting out the payment processors, making this more efficient and providing more value for both sides.

Wanted to get some feedback on viability and interest in the idea. Thinking of building a MVP once Colossus comes out. Just one of the many awesome use cases for REQ. 

Afterthought: Could we also use Aragon to create this platform that would be governed by creators?

First and foremost, this is just a shoutout to our great dev team, who give steady updates and make our Fridays even better. They're responsive, professional, and they're really doing one hell of a job, and that's not even mentioning the entire ecosystem this thing encompasses.

Secondly, this community. The mods deserve a shoutout for their awesome work to this sub and always being willing to answer questions/concerns/feedback in a timely fashion, and keeping this sub to be one of the best hubs of information/discussion regarding REQ.

This community will truly have an impact on the future of REQ. With developers being able to build on top of the REQ ecosystem/platform, it really is a community that will organically grow, and I'm excited to see what the community is ready to bring to REQ! Hell, and I'm just talking about developers who will be building on top of REQ, as I believe we'll also see some incredible projects in the future when people are using REQ for crowdfunding!

As we continually grow larger and larger as a community, we will see more and more trolls and skeptics in this sub. Fight the FUD with facts. Do not personally attack users, attack their arguments  with logic and reason.

Their will also be dips and times when the market isn't to our favor, but with the production we've seen from this dev team so far, and their vision for the future, I believe we are in for a fun ride. If you're here, reading this, I like to think you also believe in the vision that we all have for REQ.

Obviously some use cases don’t matter at all if it takes longer than 20s for example, but imagine an application in which a retailer is able to request a payment in store from a customer and it takes anywhere longer than 10s. This is just an example and may be the most simple use case to request a payment, but imagine standing at the cashier for that longer than 10-15s and clogging the line. Amazon is already testing stores without cashiers where payment needs to be even faster. 
Or a payment being requested for an online purchase. 20s is a really long time... I counted yesterday when paying by credit card in store and it was just about 10s. I’m having issues wrapping my head around it. Maybe I’m seeing it from a wrong perspective? Both use cases are in the ‚mindmeister‘ listed as POS (point of sale - similar to square app) and Online Purchase (Stripe App as e.g.)
Obviously in a B2B transaction such as invoicing for e.g. this doesn’t really matter, but in the described above situation I do see issues.

It appears to be in an usable state. Might be ready for launch in a couple of days.

If anyone wants to play around the app follow these instructions.

I recommend using Chrome and get the Metamask extension so you can switch to the Kovan Testnet. Otherwise you get error message saying it can't connect to smart contract.

When implemented the customer can use any crypto or fiat to pay and the recipient can receive any crypto or fiat in return. 

REQ is not needed by the sender or the receiver to use the network. Neither need even know it exists. 

In the future assuming scaling is achieved, Visa could use the Request network to handle all of their transactions. 

Customer A wants to buy a product from Retailer B using pounds sterling. Retailer B wants US dollars.

Customer A uses his Visa credit card to pay online. His pounds are sent to an exchange on the backend. They are immediately sold for the correct amount of dollars and the dollars are sent to Retailer B. 

A tiny fraction of his pounds are sold for REQ and the REQ is burned to fuel to transaction. The exchange also keeps a tiny fraction as a fee.

So neither party even need to know that REQ exists. And Visa have a fully automated immutable ledger to handle it all, plus they still set their fees as they tailored their usage of the Request network when they wrote their code on top of it.

Customer A doesn’t know what a blockchain is and neither does Retailer B. But they do like cheap international and online payments.

The Request Network will allow us to use any currency to pay for anything, and the merchant can receive whatever he likes in return. Think about it. Air miles or loyalty points will probably be tokenised by then. 

You could potentially buy some new shoes using air miles you don’t need in the future, and the shoe seller would receive dollars without knowing or caring what you paid with.

Crypto opens up huge world trade possibilities and the Request Network provides tools to facilitate this, and much much more.

Why REQ?
---
*Edit and example for a self-written payment system: An online shop requests 0.5 ETH at the check-out, MetaMask opens with 0.5 ETH prefilled and the user confirms with one click. The online shop backend (which could be written in any language such as Node.js, PHP, Ruby, Java, etc.) checks via web3 if the online shop's ETH address received the 0.5 ETH. Invoicing could be done by any internal system, I don't need the blockchain for this.*

*Btw, this process is employed by https://thousandetherhomepage.com/ and the animated GIF of the payment process is here and super impressive: https://gfycat.com/BleakSimilarGermanspaniel*

*However, I am interested in REQ and would like to invest long-term once I understood why it has clear benefits over a custom solution + why its valuation should be huge then (will they have any lock-in or network effect?). Right now there're just too many question marks which the whitepaper doesn't answer. Looking forward to your feedback!*

*Edit2: Would appreciate helpful replies instead of downvotes. There must be one among the 13K subscribers of this sub who could give few terse bullets why REQ is ""so much more"" without repeating references to the whitepaper and related materials. Besides, some convincing bullets and a constructive discussion here would also lead more people to buy REQ.*",NA,"7lut1e",NA,0,NA,"false",1515371255,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","false","linkflairlabel","","false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/7lut1e/trying_to_grok_req/",NA,"",NA,"Question","",0,1

Request Network basically adopts existing technologies such as Ethereum and several upcoming projects. This is what Request Network means when it says scalability. This poses several problems as it's at the mercy of Ethereum and the other projects. If Ethereum is proven to be ineffective, moving into another technology is not as easy feat. 

Does Request Network plan on possibly building their own currency technology? Other than being ""Paypal 2.0"", the core currency itself doesn't seem groundbreaking enough to take-off, which is one of the main focuses in this industry.

I just did a check on coinmarketcap, I sorted coins by 24h trading volume. Request was placed #35. I checked numbers 1-35, and out of those only 5 coins are not traded on one of the big exchanges (Bittrex, Bitthumb, GDAX, Bitfinex), one of them being BNB (which other exchanges wouldn’t want to trade). These stats make it seem quite likely, statistically, that REQ will be traded on one or more of the top exchanges in the (near) future.

Of course such things are not essential for Request to become very successful, but the more exposure the faster the mass adaption in the e-commerce world I would say (in any case, it won’t hurt).

And yes I know volume today is higher than usual, but there is a big upwards trend in the volume chart over the last few weeks.

I bought 3500 req at .08 but sold at .09 because I hate myself and can’t wait for anything good to come to me (constantly looking for a chance to “moon” in my life the moment it appears that I can). Went and bought some iota when it was presumably landing moon (dumb) a few days ago but iotas price dropped a few hours later so I sold that for a very minimal gain. Saw req was at .12 and assumed that It would drop down again to .08 or .09 being that colossus as yet to drop so I told myself I would wait and buy when it does and then just hodl for forever (was look to find a coin I would hodl anyway for the long run and I decided that coin was req but wanted to get it at the best possible price because I am also incapable of settling). Req ended up going up even more so while screaming at the top of my lungs, I ended up re buying at .15 for a little less then 3/4 the stack I had when I first bought in and now I plan to hodl for the long long run but can’t help this sick feeling I have for not just staying calm and waiting for hype and release of colossus to moon my original investment. I feel so terrible that I did that, it’s making me resent req coin for the, pure, untainted, virgin beauty that It appears to have always been. I know that req has long and hopefully prosperous road ahead of it but how do I shake this guilt and for being so stupid with my trading decisions. :( 

Again I’m new to all this but im understanding it. Im also still the idiot I always have been and would appreciate it if someone could let me know if I severely marginalized my position in req or if in few years when req as final planted its flag in the moon, I will look back and laugh at my amateur mistake while laughing to the bank :) (not that this is a laughable offense, I hope to never make a mistake like this again but you know what I mean).

Transaction cost of Paypal can be assumed to be 3% and has around 400bn USD in transaction volume per year. The means transaction revenue of 12bn per year.

Transaction cost of REQ is expected to be between 0.05% to 0.5%, getting lower as network volume increases. Assuming the lower limit fees of 0.05% and capturing the ENTIRE business of Paypal 400bn per year, “revenue” in this case through market capital gains for the remaining REQ tokens would be 200M.

Sales General &amp; Administrative costs for Paypal is around 90% leaving only 10% for profits before tax. For REQ this isn’t a factor.

Assuming REQ has no alternative use and has the same growth potential that Paypal currently has, the present valuation of REQ should be 15bn – remember this is taking paypal’s entire transaction revenue share – if it can take 1% the total market cap should only be 150M..",NA,"7lc815",NA,0,NA,"false",1515361031,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","false","linkflairlabel","","false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/7lc815/can_req_be_valued_in_comparison_with_paypal/",NA,"",NA,"Question","",0,1

I think the single greatest strength of the REQ platform is the end user could have no REQ and no understanding of how blockchain works or even that they're using it, yet still use it in many facets of their life. Was just reading a Reddit post on Elon Musk and the comments were going on and on about how much of a pain it is to pay utility bills since many water/power companies still don't have electronic options and have strict deadlines on payment. Boom use case. I've been working on entering into a business startup competition and realizing how convenient both as a business owner and a customer REQ would be for payment. Boom use case. I used to be a business major but switched to engineering after realizing how little changes in the business world and how mundane and tedious accounting was. Here comes REQ to completely upend the world of accounting. I  also live in an apartment with your standard bill at the end of the month and huge fees if late, boom continuous payments. It's not often mentioned, but there's nothing holding REQ back from eventually integrating into IoT. The list goes on and on. At its essence, REQ seems incredibly useful and simple. The fact that the team behind it has the YCombinator stamp of approval and is completely transparent and constantly updating us on where they are and where they're going makes me all the more confident that they can execute on their vision. From a speculative standpoint, I see REQ gaining value as the team releases more and more code. But when people say ""I missed out on the REQ train"" I can't but chuckle because this train isn't a week to week thing, it's the early beginning of a crypto which has perhaps the most real world application in the entire market.

A case for holding REQ","The REQ token has a very compelling reason for being held in view of the fact that Request is much more than a decentralized Paypal for fiat and crypto currencies.

Every single transaction across Request Network will use REQ, in the same way that Ethereum transactions use ETH.

Request Network has many functions beyond just simple payments, all of which will require REQ in the background as transaction fees. You don't need to own it, but the transactions you generate across Request Network will use a small amount as a fee, the cost of which will be very very tiny to the users and paid in the transaction amount (extensions will allow the payer and payee to decide who pays the transaction fee).

You will receive your salary in real time, continuously, and will pay rent in the same way as well. Accounting and taxes are done automatically in real time and leave no blank spaces or inaccuracies. Internet of things applications like smart solar grids vending excess generated power to local grid users. Request will do all of this, and it will all require REQ in the background as fee payment which will be burned in increasingly small amounts, lowering the overall supply of REQ and increasing the value of the remaining tokens.",NA,"7kn9yy",NA,0,NA,"false",1515347117,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","false","linkflairlabel","","false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/7kn9yy/request_is_much_more_than_just_a_payment/",NA,"",NA,"Discussion","",0,1

I might be experiencing a case of weak hands... I know this is REQ's Sub but I still want to lay out the reason as to why I might be selling part of my portfolio if not all of it to buy back in when things calm down.

I'm an ICO investor who more than doubled down when the price tanked, now my gains are significant (but still nothing compared to my price target) and I believe that we are about to embark a period of serious uncertainty around crypto with BTC futures around the corner; let me explain why:

Everybody is shilling that institutional money is getting in the space and the price will moon, especially with the futures trading in less than a week. But institutional money generally gets a better price than retail (Example in crypto: pre-icos with absurd minimum contributions for institutional investors or HNWI) and if it needs to it will increase volume, accumulate then sell while shorting the market to get a better price. (and futures will only make this easier with even more volume)

I still think REQ is one of the most promising ICO in the space and I'm just worried about how the futures trading and parabolic growth of BTC will affect alts. Will we see a huge spike in BTC and fall in Alts? A correction of BTC which will take everything down with it? Or a spike in all crypto assets if BTC moons? Or will it just  go sideways for some time? 

I'm conflicted about whats ahead of us in the short term and I'd love to open a discussion on it, and PLEASE PROVE ME WRONG IF YOU THINK MY THESIS IS SHORTSIGHTED.

P.S I have not invest more than what I can afford I just have experienced how it feels when you don't take some profits and the price stagnates for a while.

First of all, the Req community is truely amazing, supportive, informational, fun and awesome mods (thx /u/AdmReq and others!). Only a few trolls but they get downvoted fast enough. It’s good to see that the good posts receive a lot of upvotes. 

I’m balls deep in Request Network, bought at the lowest possible point. Now I noticed that I’m really addicted to checking the price the whole time, looking for updates and rumours. But I really shouldn’t, here’s why:

- Colossus is releasing soon
- Announcement soon
- Request team is actively networking in the background
- They are moving to Signapore to work closely with Kyber
- YC companies pull eachother up (coinbase, reddit, airbnb), that stuff is known.
- Social media awareness is exploding and we are  only 3 months in. 
- Q1 we have mainnet

Aka the price is going to explode. Wether I refresh the blockfolio app every 5 seconds or not. Corrections will happen, thats good too. Request Network is not immune to market principles. 
I’m going to take a very comfy break knowing all this. Trying to reduce checking the price to once in the morning. And I think other REQmarines should too. I will remain to help newcomers in the community where ever I can. 

Req is solid, and so is my trust in my position.

What I am saying is...what is the incentive for businesses to switch over? From what I gathered, REQ offers several unique benefits:

1) Transparency
2) No need for audits (Immutable Ledger)
3) No hidden fees
4) No taking sensitive information

These are all benefits for the consumer, but not the businesses.  Ultimately, they are the ones who decide if they add a ""Request"" button on their checkout page.

Quote from a mycryptopedia-post. Does this have any reason to be this way, any functional explanation? If not it would seem like it is only to drive up price, making this a big red flag to me.

Also, making requests for money human to human or company to human is allready existing? Like, i have multiple apps with the function built into them. Does this not make the req-network somewhat redundant?

Seller receives in ETH. Transaction fee incurred because of the ETH transaction. Are they only incurred in Request Network (REQ) transaction fee?

They've released a statement that they want to grow their offering significantly. He's my reasoning as to why REQ will be listed 

## The customer experience will drive their decision making
They'll continue to focus and prioritise the customer experience. I understand the scaling / customer service issues they're being hit by. But, that's an operational challenge they have the resources to resolve. 

So, if we consider the customer experience to be their core focus, they will be reluctant to offer coins which have significant overlap in purpose. So, no Vertcoin or Neo (I hold both). It will cause too confusion in their target market.  

An exception here is if there is a conflicting self interest. For example, a preference for a fork of Bitcoin. Having said that, I don't think they'll want to push this again and generally want to stay out of crypto politics after their recent experiences with 2x. 

## They need to be squeaky clean
No Monero, sorry. 

## They've been burnt by technical issues
They are very much aware of the scaling challenges they face. I think they will shift towards technologies which are ready to scale and where they can leverage existing development. 

So, ERC20 tokens could feature prominently. Or, if not an ERC-20 token, it would require a strong, supportive ecosystem and not overlap with their existing offerings. 

## We'll see the REQ and associated tokens
So, if customer experience and low technical risk are the key drivers, I think ERC-20 tokens will most likely feature most prominently. Personally, I think REQ and the other ERC20 tokens it leverages (e.g. Civic) have the greatest chance of all. 

- It fits into their existing timelines. The full, market ready Request product will be launched next year. 
- They are launched from the same incubator. Have the same VC networks.  
- They are solving a real world problem and no overlap with existing cryptos they offer. In fact, it extends the utility of the ones they exist (e.g. automated ETH/LTC/BTC payments).  

## Other suggestions:
I also think we'll see Ripple or Stellar. Perhaps Iota as well.

i don't have a large percentage of my holdings in REQ at this point, but i'm wondering what people's thoughts were on the apparent/possible rivalry between REQ and XLM.  there is speculation that paypal might be warming up to XLM, which might make REQ and XLM rivals in the intersectional space of online retail payment.  seeing as this probably represents a massive chunk of the utility of both coins, does anyone here think that REQ is an XLM killer?  non-crypto users (like my parents or other less tech savvy individuals) will probably continue using paypal even if requests are an option, so i can see how XLM-fuelled paypal has the potential to beef up the price of XLM in the short term.  but in the long term, i don't see how REQ doesn't crush XLM.

From what I understand, when the Request Network is being used for payments and transactions, a REQ token will be burned in the transaction.  Does an entire token get burned in the transaction, or just a piece of one?  Whose token gets burned?  Is it chosen randomly or is there a queued order to them?  

My understanding is also that the owner of the consumed token receives some percentage of the transaction fee.  How is this sum received?  Is the sum received in the currency of the transaction?

You are, very likely, as a holder of REQ making a calculated move with your money that could make you much better off than you are now.  Of course, that move is more of a gamble than an investment.  No matter how much backing REQ has, from YCombinator to ING (Moneytis), or how much research you and I do, Bitcoin could implode and take all alts with it, or any number of scenarios could play where we could lose what we've put into this space.  That being said, please do yourself a big favor and DON'T use a credit card, or invest everything you have, unless you are okay with losing everything.  So, this is a gamble, but it's a calculated one, taken on a good team with a solid idea that has some big names backing it. 





That said, it is my belief, that no matter what price you bought in at, you must HODL REQ and not succumb to the vagaries of trying to predict and trade the other big movers.  Yes, it hurts to see LTC move so much when you aren't in it, but that is part of it, it's part of life.  I believe it is likely that we will all win if we just hold on to what we have, and if we don't, we went down supporting a concept (talking about all cryptos here) that could change the world.






It's a concept borne of big instutitions fucking over the American public in 2007-2008 and beyond and not seeing a single bit of jail time for it.  About the little guy (you and I) being crushed by the establishment of money and power.  Money and power doesn't lose often in this country (other than the #metoo movement).  And I have a tentative prediction that money and power will attempt to manipulate the crypto space to their ends as well, and it could be that a lot of us lose again to their rapaciousness.  But to this day, the very people that extended this monstrous middle finger to the existing system and created Bitcoin and crypto, many of them not only got to possibly rearrange the world order (maybe, one day, possibly), but also got to profit handsomely from it too.  At least for a while, a few little guys got to win.  We might be part of those monetary winners, we might not, but I want to say, if some of you do win big, I know that some of you, lambos are your thing, but you'll be doing yourself a big favor by living the mantra ""HODL, moon,....peace of mind"".  ""HODL, moon, FUCK YOU money"".  ""HODL, moon, make the world a better place to live in.""  ""HODL, moon, donating to any number of worthwhile charities"".  And at the very least, this has been a fun ride, even if the whole thing goes down in flames tomorrow.

Most other coins bleed.

Bitcoin is about to be listed on more future trading places (as much as I know) sometimes soon, thus people are rushing and trading their alts for BTC, not realizing that they aren't ""helping"" Btc price moving up AT ALL by selling their alts for BTC. BTC moves up in USD price because of fiat and usdt trading. 

This means that if you want to ""help"" BTC price, you must trade your alts either for USDT (tether) or fiat (fiat Uno, a car) currencies, then buy BTC.

Wait till Monday, then make your call when all this dust settles. I personally believe REQ will go higher than 0.27$ next week, perhaps over 0.30$.

The 100's of coins that exist, is just too overwhelming for mainstream society. Who has time to research all of this? Satoshi's vision was to have a decentralized platform that anyone can use in the world, for very low fee's. 

Unfortunately Bitcoin is no longer that, it's more of a store of wealth. Request is simple, elegant, doesn't require you to go on exchanges or setup a wallet. You just send/accept a request, save money on fee's and all of the blockchain action is encapsulated from the end user. **Add in the fact that Request will be fiat friendly, which is a killer app for Request.** This is why I feel Request will still be around once most of these alt's come and go.

TL;DR - **I can see my Mom and Dad using Request to send money, buy things on Amazon, etc before I can see them setting up a wallet and buying cryptocurrencies on exchanges.** Unlike most alt's, Request has a very low barrier for entry.

Let's all band together and make sure this community stands out compared to the other sub-reddits. Let's proudly wear the Request jersey, while staying grounded in this chaos. 

I suggest we: 
- Be open to different opinions, encourage everyone to stress test the Request vision and future with strong arugments
- Fight FUD with facts and logical arguments rather than sentiment
- Encourage criticism with strong arguments. let's make sure the Request team can use it. 
- Let's stop lurking as a community and start contributing. Spread the Request vision to different sub-reddits. let's Shill, but in a positive way i.e. Post about the technology and the vision. This way we can get more support and get Request the attention it deserves. 

Let's show this community we are different.

I'm excited to see how far they can go with the website to interact with Request in terms of integrating various wallets, it's clear we're starting with Metamask but the more wallets we have - the more likely it will be a go to choice for Requesting payments from people without risk.

Christmas is very soon and I think it’s a great time to sit back and spend some valuable time with our loved ones and forget about crypto for a bit. Lately everyone around Reddit, crypto forums and 4chan has been going around in a money craze looking for the next big thing to Pump and Dump but that’s not healthy in the long run. You get addicted, you get greedy and you’ll cause more damage than good. 

I know that relaxing when your money’s involved is very hard but you can’t be on the buzz 24/7, it’s not healthy. It drains you and I’ve been there. 

Also let’s not forget that Request Network is a company that could change the way online commerce works and how we know it, and big things like this don’t happen overnight. We shall have bumpy roads, we shall have smooth sails but above all he who stays strong as an old oak and doesn’t fret shall prevail and live on the moon.

As of this moment, Request has a market cap of $160m, based on the current supply of Req in circulation and the current market price. 

The assumption that they make in their whitepaper is the global market transits about $5 trillion a day. I would say that in the mid- to long-term, if (!) Req turns out to be successful, it could maybe have a 0.01%-0.05% market share which translates into a total transaction volume of $0.2tn - $1tn per year (consider that VISA had a transaction volume of $8.9 tn in 2016:https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/global/about-visa/documents/visa-facts-figures-jan-2017.pdf).

The whitepaper aims for transaction fees to be between 0.05% and 0.5%. They have to be set low initially, in order to get things going. Lets assume that we have an average transaction fee of 0.125% or something. This would then be 250 - 1200 $mn in transaction fees. Let's us be relatively conservative and assume transaction fees of $500mn per year mid-long term. 
Let's say they have a 5% chance to pull this off and we look 20 years into the future. 5%*20*$500mn = 0.5bn. Obviously, however, you need to apply some discount factor to take account the time value of money. If I had more time on my hands I would do a full DCF analysis, but I have an exam next Wednesday :D. 

As a rough indication, I would therefore put the sort-of justified market cap of req at about $300mn in the short-term, if no new information comes in and things go along the plan. This translates into a price of $0.5.

I know that part of this analysis is wishful thinking and the true value might be different. Additionally, outside factors like interest rates or a burst in the crypto bubble are not taken into account. Further, a lot of cryptocurrencies, and this might include Req, are bought for speculative purposes, so that the price might be unrelated to actual value.

But based on these back-of-the-envelope calculations, I will buy more Req right now :D

After doing my research on REQ and seeing what a great coin and community it has, I decided to buy some on binance. I've heard a lot of advice on not storing your alts on an exchange so I decided to eat the 15 REQ fee and send it to MEW where it would be safe.


My mistake began when for some reason I logged in by manually entering my private key rather than using my UTC and password (at the time I thought the private key was the only way to log in for some reason). I must've mistyped the private key and logged into some random wallet, where I then proceeded to send my REQ to. The worst part is I had my paper wallet printed out next to me which I could've used to verify my address but it was late and I wanted to finish asap so the thought  didn't enter my head. Thankfully I didn't lose a lot (70 REQ), but the I was more bummed out that I lost it through such a careless and stupid mistake :/

This purpose of this post is not only for me to vent a little but also to warn the noobs like me to PRINT OUT YOUR MEW WALLET AND VERIFY THE ADDRESS YOU ARE SENDING TO BY LOOKING AT THE PRINTED PAPER. At the end of the day I still believe in REQ, and I know I'll try to investing again one day once I have some more money.

First of all I think Request is an amazing project with the potention to really grow really big as it is potential to be superior to PayPal and other online payment methods. 

Request will be running on the Ethereum network which currently can handle about 15 transactions per second. I know Ethereums Raiden network is planned to be released in the next year to update to 1000 transactions per second, however if Request want to be a big player in the payment industry it obviously should be able to handle tens of thousands of transactions per second. 


So I was wondering what the solution will be for scaling.

Also, could it be possible for the Request Network to move to an own blockchain, like Walton is doing next year? Or to move to a 'better' (able to transfer more transactions per second) decentralized network like NEO/Cardano?",NA,"7i17oa",NA,0,NA,"false",1515295709,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/7i17oa/question_about_scalability/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

I would appreciate if anyone could answer some questions.
1. I noticed that REQ works together with Kyber (good project imo) and with 0x. Aren't both projects some kind of DEX (Kyber works without orderbook, but with liquidity storage) and 0x is a dex who works with a regular orderbook, but to keep costs down parity of the price will be off line ( correct me if i'm wrong). how does REQ have need for both companies ?

2. The whitepaper mentioned some scaling sollutions like sharding, and maybe plasma witch will help scale REQ to do regular transacties (B2B &amp; B2C), but as it also mentions the emerging IoT market. Plasma and sharding ar not the best sollutions for micropayments as it would need for IoT payments. so are there any plans regarding the use of uRaiden (off-chain scaling for micropayments)?

3. will civic be used to link an profile (addres) so people cant make multiple wallets just because their previous account had a bad reputation ( late payments etc.). 

4. if you pay with for example BTC --&gt; USD who pays for the conversion ? (i guess the payer)

Thanks in advance.
Other than these questions is see a lot of potential for REQ.

I am new to all of this, but have deciding to take the jump into crypto coins.

A friend of mine will buy me some BTC. From there, I am a bit lost.

Here is what I understand:

1) I need to make a wallet to accept the BTC
2) I need to transfer my BTC to an exchange
3) Buy REQ
4) Move REQ to an offline wallet?

I will be honest part of what worries me is using this information online. I am sort of paranoid now about all the free (but legal) software and pop up ads I have come across.

I'm only starting with 1K but I still want to keep it.

Any advice specifically to making the move from no BTC and a friend buying some for me? The whole process of buying BTC with validation etc worries me. I don't like giving out data.

It promises to be able to do as much as anything out there now, and at costs that are potentially an order of magnitude lower. Conventional wisdom would dictate that REQ could end up being as big a boy on the block as PayPal, or even bigger.

So why are people saying that REQ might hit $1, or $5, or $10? Such estimates of an REQ token price are a wide margin off from the market capitalization that would indicate REQ ousting PayPal. In fact, if REQ equaled PayPal’s market capitalization, REQ’s value per token would exceed $135—a 38,500% increase from the current value. Here’s an explanation.

The value of an REQ token is quite simple: it is the total investments (market capitalization) divided by the number of tokens in circulation. Currently, that’s about $220 million USD, over 640,779,733 REQ in circulation. Because REQ operates using a token blockchain, the supply of REQ is fixed—there’s no way to “mine” REQ. In fact, it’s possible for the supply to decrease, because tokens are burned to facilitate transactions—but it may be quite some time before enough tokens are burned before the price is affected, since there are 1 billion tokens total. At the current market cap and circulating supply, that puts the value at around $0.34

So, the question of potential value for REQ is dictated by only one question: what is the expected market capitalization once the technology’s potential has been realized? To answer that, let’s look at some current payment facilitators that REQ will compete with, and observe their market caps.

**Visa: $258.39 bn**

**MasterCard: $160.24 bn**

**PayPal: $88.48 bn**

**American Express: $86.20 bn**

**Discover: $27.95 bn**

**Combined: $621.26 bn**

The smallest of the above is Discover, which has a market cap of only $27.95 billion. That’s still over 100 times the market cap of REQ. If REQ manages to capture even 10% of the current market capitalization of the Big 5, REQ would have a market cap of over $62 billion, and a token value of almost $100.

Now the above picture is somewhat incomplete. The market capitalization of a company like Visa is a reflection of the investment based on the expectation increased value, which is typically defined by the company’s revenue stream. So, a determination of REQ’s potential market cap is not just what is the current norm, but also what is the potential revenue? The good folks at Ledger Research have given us some insight into this.

According to a report assessing the investment value of REQ, [Ledger Research](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/6f7ca2_96ffee2e91f14af3bbbcecdbc7aee3b1.pdf) estimates that REQ can capture a tenth of a percent of global transactions, and to conduct transactions at the lowest possible cost, the value of tokens burnt would be $912 million annually—effectively a revenue stream of $912 million per year. At 1% of global transactions, that climbs to $9.1 billion per year. For context, Visa’s annual revenue is about $15 billion, and PayPal’s is about $11 billion. The total transaction volume of Visa, according to a [report in February](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-visa-results/visas-profit-revenue-tops-estimates-on-payment-volume-growth-idUSKBN15H2S0), was $1.8 trillion in 2016. Visa holds about 44 percent of the market share for credit card transactions, and 65 percent of the market share for debit transactions, meaning it accounts for more than half of all non-cash transactions worldwide.

In lay terms, REQ only has to capture a very small portion of global transactions to have a revenue stream that is competitive with leaders in the non-cash payments industry. Non-cash services, like Visa or PayPal, are restricted in their growth due to their reliance on banks and credit streams—something REQ doesn’t require.

The upshot is that bullish sentiments of between $1-10 per REQ are synonymous with an assumption that REQ would barely make a dent in the payments world. Bullish sentiments of around $100 would be more consistent with an expectation of REQ reaching a similar size or payment volume to incumbent payment facilitators.

As a caveat, this is going to take quite some time. PayPal started in 1998, and Visa began in 1958. It is going to be years, perhaps even a decade or more, before REQ can hit a comparable market cap to incumbents.  Of course, everyone claims things like they “wish they had invested in Apple.” Well Apple’s IPO was December 12th, 1980, and a $1000 investment on that date would be worth nearly $400,000 37 years later. It is not going to be obvious over the next few months, or even the next year if REQ will reach the moon—but if it does get its moonshot, it could be a huge one, and people should be patient for it.",NA,"7n3dv0",NA,0,NA,"false",1515395417,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","false","linkflairlabel","","false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/7n3dv0/why_req_could_reach_100/",NA,"",NA,"Price / Market","",0,1

&amp;nbsp;

Here are four questions president Sam Altman asks about a company before deciding to invest:
https://qz.com/913913/these-are-the-four-questions-y-combinator-uses-to-identify-the-next-unicorn/

&amp;nbsp;

1) Will this company build something lots of people really love?

“If so, and if ‘lots’ is sufficiently large, the company has the chance to produce substantial earnings.”

**How this relates to Request - Consumers will love Request Network because of the low fee's, ease of use and it's many use cases. Business will love Request because it will reduce the complexities of Auditing/Invoicing.**


&amp;nbsp;


2) Will this company be easy to copy?

“The most successful companies I’ve worked with have a significant competitive advantage—network effect, proprietary technology, complex coordination, or barrier to entry of some other sort. I understand in theory it’s possible to build a very successful commodity company, but I don’t know how to do it.”

**How this relates to Request - Technically, yes Request can be copied, since it is open source. But then again, so is Ethereum. It will much more beneficial for a developer to build financial applications on TOP of Request, instead of re-inventing the wheel.**

&amp;nbsp;


3) Will these founders develop into “forces of nature”?

“As most people say, it’s hard to make money unless you invest in great founders. Defining what that means is usually left as an exercise to the reader. Here are some questions I ask myself: Are these founders relentlessly determined? Are they original thinkers? Are they smart, and especially do they have new insights I haven’t heard before? Are they good communicators (and so will they be able to hire, sell, raise money, talk to the press, etc)? Are they focused and intense? Do they always seem to find a way around obstacles? Would I work for them?
“This is the often the hardest factor for me to evaluate, because you have to make a judgment about trajectory—you are trying to predict where someone will be in five years.”

**How this relates to Request - The team has displayed great communication and transparency so far. They have already delivered a successful application to find the lowest rates for international money transfer(Moneytis). The development team is small, but they are churning out quality code very rapidly if you check out their github. Everyone gave kudos to how well the ico was conducted. The developers also wrote code for the ICO, which was actually Request's first deliverable.**

&amp;nbsp;

4) Does this company have a clear and important mission?

“Without this, I usually get bored. More importantly, companies that don’t have this usually have a hard time recruiting enough great people to work with them, and thus struggle to become very large.”

**How this relates to Request - Request's will drastically advance B2B invoicing, Online Payments, Auditing, Invoicing and Expenses by leveraging blockchain technology. Request is combing the first use case of the blockchain(sending money) and the power of the immutable ledger for auditing and invoicing. This I feel is a very strong use case, much stronger than most ico's that are just 'tokenizing' app ideas.**",NA,"7gyufi",NA,0,NA,"false",1512334347,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/7gyufi/the_four_questions_that_ycombinator_uses_to/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,1

Wouldn’t it be a great idea if REQ could link with Coinbase accounts (like how PayPal can with your bank account)? This way if you’re shopping, you choose “Pay with Request” and the Request Network could pull crypto from a coinbase wallet and convert it to the appropriate currency accepted by the vendor. 

I used Coinbase as an example because it’s a good gateway. Many people use coinbase to make their first crypto purchase. There will also be people who aren’t tech savvy or are afraid to move between wallets and exchanges. This would make Coinbase a great focal point for in/out when they add support for other tokens.

Now, with ING pulling out, and if YCombinator is also pulling out, it will be a bad sign about the transparency of the team.

Does YCombinator still advise Request network? Can Request team clarify this position for the sake of transparency?

Also, what is being done to get new customers for Request on board? Whom are we speaking to? In the end - whether YCombinator or ING or others do not matter, but the customers. What is being done on that front? Who will be using Request network in testnet? This is the most important thing we would like to hear as investors.

Eventually platforms to build these ideas will take over. My bet is Request will be one of them!","If you look at why Ethereum was created, it was in response to the over saturated alt coin market, where there was literally a coin for every use case imaginable(weedcoin, foodcoin, bbqcoin, charitycoin, etc).

&amp;nbsp;

Ethereum became a platform where many use cases can be built on top of one single platform.

&amp;nbsp;

The same can be said for ICO's. There is a lot of redundancy and eventually most of these ideas will be built on top of another platform. 

&amp;nbsp;

 For example, Verify was a new ICO where users have a reputation score and can sell/buy goods using verify payments.

&amp;nbsp;

Another couple of ICO's deal with the ticketing industry(Aventus, GUTS, etc) using the blockchain to essentially reduce ticket sale fraud.

&amp;nbsp;

Then you have Monetha, looking to be a decentralized paypal with a reputation system.

&amp;nbsp;

Then you have BlockCAT and EtherParty, which provide end users the ability to build their own smart contracts easily. One interesting use case for both is Crowdfunding.

&amp;nbsp;

All of these ICO's could've probably been build on top of Request. Request has uses cases for Crowdfunding, Peer to peer money transfer, reputation system, auditing via the blockChain, etc.

&amp;nbsp;

As of now, it may be more profitable to start an ICO for each use case, but the time is running out, as the market is becoming oversaturated right now, and the same ideas won't draw as much interest from Investors anymore. 

&amp;nbsp;

With that said, the market will eventually reach a point where it is more lucrative to build a dapp on top of a robust platform, and collect fee's from transactions.

&amp;nbsp;

Think of it like this, would you rather start your own e-commerce site just to sell your goods or just sell your goods on Amazon? Why re-invent the wheel?

&amp;nbsp;

I can see this transition happening within the next year or so as the ICO craze starts to cool off.

I understand the use cases from the white paper and that some kind of privacy features are planned. However, I was wondering that with enough time and resources participants in the network could be identified and you could maybe derive business performance data from it in real time. This would be a big issue for all private companies as well as listed companies before quarterly reports etc. 

Also immutability sounds like a good idea in audit but might actually not be the case from the companies point of view which in turn could prevent them from using it. 

Any thoughts on these things?

Hi all, I have heard a lot of mentioning of paying transactions in many small installments, such as having your wages be paid out in hourly installments. How does this concept relate to the reality that for every transaction on the Request network Ethereum gas will have to be paid, which recently could be worth up to several USD’s worth of gas per transactions on congested moments. 

How easy will it be to switch to a faster and cheaper backbone network if Ethereum becomes too slow? It would be unfortunate if due to Cryptokitties 2.0, the gas price is higher than the actual transaction value, or that it takes over day for your hourly wage to be paid out.

In 2018 the PSD2 (Payment Services Directive) will come into effect in the EU. The most promising and interesting aspect of this Directive is that banks, on the customers request, are under an obligation to make the customer's bank account accessible to third parties applications.

Through the use of the API provided by the banks, applications are able to interact with the customers account. Meaning that a third party application can show account balances and make payments on the customers request.

I see a great opportunity for Request to bring both the fiat and crypto world together in one application. Leveraging both the revolutionary crypto and traditional fiat system will bridge the the gap between these two worlds.

 I would love to have Request Network manage both my fiat and crypto transactions and payment requests. What do you guys think? 

Greetings Duck Nukem

I'm a huge believer in REQ's potential and have invested.  I got my education in Accounting and think that their vision/uses cases are revolutionary.

Admittedly, I am very non-technical -- especially when it comes to crypto/blockchain.  So I got a friend to evaluate REQ on a technical level.  He had quite a few concerns.  

I've listed them below. It's a lot of stuff so feel free to pick and choose which questions to answer.  I'd love to hear from the actual developers like AdmREQ if possible.

- What is REQ's security model? PoS or PoB? 

- Where can I get more information about it's technicals, such as average block time, blocksize limit, average transaction size, etc?

- What direct financial incentive do gateways have to pay the operating costs to run a gateway? Are there none? If so, what incentive does anyone have to run s gateway other then for ideologically reasons. 

- Since as long as one gateway is being run, everyone still benefits. Creating a network controlled by one gateway, aka it's end up something 100% centralized like Paypal but with a shiny new name and look. 

- Do I just need to look at the github code or is it listed somewhere? Or do they not know some of these things yet since they're still doing testnet stuff only? 

Thanks for any help.  Looking forward to hearing back on these potential holes in REQ's tech. ",NA,"7h5vdb",NA,0,NA,"false",1512338303,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/7h5vdb/hodler_of_req_with_some_important_questions_about/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,1

As I understand it, RequestNetwork is built on the back of Ethereum, utilizing the smart contract ability of Ethereum. To get REQ tokens, they cannot be mined and must be purchased via other coins. From what I can tell, there is a fixed amount of REQ tokens that exist. Token burn is prevented by having transaction fees scale percentage-wise. My questions are these:


----

* ~~what set the initial fixed amount of REQ tokens?~~

[This apparently did](https://blog.request.network/request-networks-token-sale-terms-overview-ca4278606c3)

----

* What's to stop someone in the future from changing that fixed amount of REQ tokens to be substantially larger?

----
* ~~Where are REQ tokens stored?~~ 


Stored on the blockchain beside ethereum as ERC20 tokens. 

----
* can REQ tokens be stored in a wallet such as Mist or Parity? How is this done?

""Yes they can, REQ is an ERC20 token meaning they can be stored in your Ethereum wallet."" ~ *admREQ*

----

* If Ethereum fails and RequestNetwork jumps to some new Smart Contract platform, what happens to the prior existing REQ tokens?


edit: new questions:

----

* Do high transaction fees on Ethereum directly cause high transaction fees for ERC20 tokens?

----
* How will the issue of [slow transaction times in the future](https://medium.com/@yobanjo/ethereum-wont-scale-like-you-ve-been-told-cae445bef539) be avoided for Ethereum?

REQ talks about their paypal 2.0 being a minor piece of something much bigger. i'd agree that's true. every phone basically has a paypal 2.0 feature native to the OS and there are dozens of alternatives already. 

they talk about the main feature being some complex accounting system that allows the government, auditors, irs, etc to access the system to ""do away"" with traditional accounting methods for people using REQ. 

how does this work with sarbanes-oxley, GAAP, and the dozens of regulations set forth by the federal government to regulate the accounting world? just spouting ""REQ will take care of it"" is not the answer. paypal sends out 1099s. it would be like paypal sending in their financials and you telling the IRS that your money is in there somewhere.

An existing/exciting use case.","You know those friends that pay money back very slowly and after many times asking? For example for a pizza you bought together? I come from The Netherlands, and there we have ""Tikkie"" (see tikkie.me), which solves this problem in our current FIAT system. I would consider this as an existing and working usecase of what Request Network can do in blockchain. I had not read about this use case in the documents, got excited and wrote it down to share. 

Tikkie is a véry popular and very easy method to send a payment request to your friends/family/whoever. For example to split the bill for the pizza you bought yesterday. This request can be sent via whatsapp. When you receive the link, you can choose which bank you have, which then shows you the requested transaction. In the back-end the link constructs the entire transaction for you (account numbers, amount, etc).  You only have to confirm the transaction using your bank card, the corresponding pin code and a ""random reader"" (a ledger or trezor-like device which nearly every Duch bank uses). Three clicks and youre done. 

This is a secure solution that confirms the transaction between you and your friend/whoever. The main advantage is that you dont have to go to your bank's website, type in the account number, amount and all the common things that make it time consuming and prone to errors. Because it is so simple and fast, people don't have remind their friends as often to pay them back since it it is so easy.

So the use case is strong and yet simple. You can do the math. And no, I do not have any interest in Tikkie, but realized this when a friend sent me a payment request.

I am new-ish (1 month) to crypto and interested in the micro-payment sector of cryptocurrencies; my research has led me to REQ and XRB as two of the more promising projects. The main difference that I can extrapolate from reading both whitepapers is structural- REQ is block-chain based while XRB is DAG. Am I missing something else related to fees (both promise minimal if not immaterial), speed (both promise almost instant transactions), etc? My background is in finance and not related to software in any way, but I am excited to learn more about the tech.

I've been following the Request project for a while now and I really appreciate the idea and project in every aspect. That being said, I currently own a decent (in my eyes) portion, but would like to increase it. We've all seen the recent IOTA and Mona rocket ships, and honestly it would be great to finally land one of those. I have a great feeling REQ will accomplish something, maybe not to same extent, and rather something similar to Vechain the past days, but gains are gains! 

I am thinking of moving over some of my NEO which I got in during ANS days, because I have a very similar feeling about REQ as I did with ANS when it was sitting around 5$. Don't get me wrong, NEO is a fantastic project, and I will certainly be heading back soon, but I feel it won't do a 2x anytime this month (due to ICOS being next year and no major updates I believe? Correct me if i'm wrong PLEASE), whereas I feel REQ has a greater probability this month. Which leads me to my question: HOW BIG is the impact of Colossus? My technical background is very minimal, so I can't wrap my head around this. Perhaps somebody with greater knowledge, insight and wisdom could help me visualise (preferably in simple/layman terms, and with the help of an example), just how incredible/important this update will be.

&amp;nbsp;

Some have gone as far as to create a petition and post it on this reddit, as if that would even matter, however it should be obvious that Coinbase do not list based on user demand and petitions. Others want to shut-up speculation completely as it creates false expectations which are shattered should they not come true in the future, and the price would reflect that drastically. However I want to give this speculation a fair shot regardless, because at the very least I think it is fun, and I think Request will do well with or without a Coinbase listing.

&amp;nbsp;

__________________________________________________________

&amp;nbsp;

So what is driving this all of a sudden? Well speculation seems to have recently arisen over the release of the following youtube video that has made several news sites:

&amp;nbsp;

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLoRS49ap18

&amp;nbsp;

Where in this video he states the following:

*“The ones that are the most exciting to us that we have on the platform today are bitcoin, ethereum and litecoin, but there’s many more that are going to be added to the platform in 2018 and I think this is going to be a really exciting space for all kinds of institutional investors to make money.”*

&amp;nbsp;

We have seen what normie money can do entering the market, BTC, LTC and ETH have all pumped drastically with all the extra media attention, they pump almost only because they are visible as one of 3 choices on Coinbase, the easiest fiat gateway to use to get into crypto. More and more news articles are coming up about people even going as far as to take out mortgages to buy into crypto, and we all want to see that sweet juicy spike on our portfolios.

&amp;nbsp;

__________________________________________________________

&amp;nbsp;

So lets take it back a step, why would Request be worthy of the listing in the first place? So far we know there are plans to add ""many more"" coins to Coinbase, but what is the decision process? Sorry to break it to you, it isn't a petition, instead we were given this last month:

&amp;nbsp;

https://www.gdax.com/static/digital-asset-framework-2017-11.pdf

&amp;nbsp;

This is a framework, a list of requirements that the token/company must fulfill to be considered for the listing. So let's do a quick run down of the 6 major points (not going to cover it in detail against each sub-point, this would simply take too long) and whether or not Request meets this criteria:

&amp;nbsp;

**1. GDAX Mission and Values - Pass!**

Request solves the problem of invoicing and presents it in a user friendly manor, in addition its use cases include payment requests, auditing, IOT, acts as a payment gateway and provides currency agnostic transfers. It easily passes the whole criteria with flying colors.

&amp;nbsp;

**2. Technology - Fail, but not for long!**

The project is open source and well documented on their Github page. Their smart contract was peer reviewed by Quantstamp, who also provides the third party security audit requirement. The team not only met deadlines but they pulled them back even earlier! They interact with the community via Telegram, Slack and even provide us bi-weekly updates on their blog with great insight to the project. The road-map outlines and meets just about every criteria laid out here except for the presence of a test-net or main-net. So the only criteria they are missing here will actually be met within the next week or two! Which is great news.

&amp;nbsp;

**3. Legal and Compliance - Pass!**

The token is a utility token and not a security.

&amp;nbsp;

**4. Market Supply - Fail!**

We are in the top 100 of coin market caps, maybe soon to be top 50. There is a huge supply of 1 billion tokens, 650 million in circulation currently and an extra 350 million currently locked away, so the supply meets the demand. The Kyber partnership adds the trade velocity and liquidity needed to convert to another asset, but Kyber is not yet ready and neither are we integrated with them yet. We are listed on plenty of exchanges, Liqui, Kucoin, EtherDelta, Gate.io, COSS, Mercatox, Decentrex, IDEX and Binance. However no fiat pairs exist yet, which is one of the criteria in this section (not sure how this would be repaired, it would actually need the Coinbase listing for this, chicken before the egg kind of scenario almost).

&amp;nbsp;

**5. Market Demand - Pass!**

Lot's of commits on Github, they have done plenty of Q+A's via the blog and have community managers on hand to answer questions in slack and telegram. Once again we receive the bi-weekly update which also provides us with valued feedback. They had a closed pre-sale stage so it is likely there are investments from firms/hedge funds present. Ycomb is likely one of these who also has experience working with crypto companies (they actually worked with Coinbase!). Market Cap has grown and we run on the ETH blockchain which is already listed on Coinbase so we meet blockchain based requirements automatically. We also have had a very large increase in token holders, especially given the recent pumps!

&amp;nbsp;

**6. Crypto Economics - Pass!**

Once again, a utility token, we are not a security. As a result we pass most of the criteria here automatically, especially by running on the ETH blockchain. Regarding the ICO requirement, Request passed, easily, as this was one of the best performed ICO's this year. The ownership stake is indeed a minority stake (350mil vs the current 650 mil in circulation) and is currently in a lock-up period. Whitelists were KYC based to ensure participation equality and the team once again provided plenty of transparency via their social media pages and blog. The tokens were distributed via smart contract and the security requirement was fulfilled by the Quantstamp audit to ensure against hacks, theft of funds and other vulnerabilities. In addition their slack had an anti-scam bot that prevented/limited the possibility of scams surfacing (especially important given that the whitelist was being on Slack in the first place). 

&amp;nbsp;

__________________________________________________________

&amp;nbsp;

**Conclusion:** I would say we are actually a likely contender once we achieve the main-net and Kyber is up and running along with integration. Connections with Y-Comb who also advised Coinbase could also be a cause for further speculation. Matter of fact due to how much criteria they meet in the framework (and at a very high, detailed level too) I would even suspect they have had knowledge of these requirements before the PDF was released to the public (maybe Y-Comb had a part in this too). 

&amp;nbsp;

Equally I don't think it matters whether or not we are listed, the project will do well regardless. The team has also been outspoken about their belief in the future of DEX's and how they will ultimately win vs centralized exchanges, which is why I could also speculate that they also may not pursue a fiat gateway based listing. Once again this is all done because I was bored and just wanted to give my take on this recent discussion, let me know your thoughts!

With the price at $0,05, that was $1,50, so that was okay back then, but now it's about $9 to $11 per withdrawal!

I have no experience with Binance lowering their fees, but I sent in a support ticket yesterday asking them to consider lowering their withdrawal fee, due to the recent raise in value. 

I suppose that if they get a lot of support tickets about this, they will consider it faster than if I'm the only one, or if we only complain here privately on our subreddit.

Binance actually calls their support tickets ""requests"", so it seems everyone here should put in a request to help Request (Network)! I put it under the 'withdrawal / deposits' category, I suppose that would be the correct one.

Imagine you could go to EtherDelta and use EUR/USD/etc to directly purchase any of the available alts. You could also cash out to fiat straight from ED. This would indirectly lead to fiat pairs for all alts (i.e. USD-REQ, EUR-ZRX, etc). Every fiat deposit/withdrawal would burn some REQ.

I can also see someone building a simplified decentralized exchange which is entirely based on Request. The landing page would show a list of alts with prices in your local fiat currency (or ETH). You enter the amount you wish to purchase and click Buy, and the exchange would send a Request which needs to be filled within a certain time. Once the Request is filled the exchange's smart contract would release your newly purchased tokens.

This could be the decentralized Coinbase, and every transaction would involve burning some REQ.

REQ's simple, streamlined approach to UI/UX would be incredibly compatible with Shopify's philosophy. REQ could easily become **the best crypto gateway** available on the platform, and with the right marketing, could rapidly actualize REQ's stated goals.

So, I made a quick test, with some assumptions. 

Assumptions are a .05% transaction fee on all transactions and that REQ has Paypal's volume of transactions. I assumed that market cap would stay the same as tokens were burned, increasing the price of an individual token, but leaving the total net 'worth' of REQ the same. I tested starting market caps of 1 billion, 10 billion, and 100 billion. I also assumed that all tokens were in circulation.

[Here's my quick results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wj1B4k1XSGAAvowOdMlGfmbGbu4tSbAzqoK7EaJB9dA/edit#gid=0). I ran it for ~25 years, balancing quarterly, and the basic mechanism was that as the worth of a token increased, the cost of a transaction in tokens decreases. In other words, a $100 transaction with a .05% transaction fee costs .05 REQ when a token equals $1, but if that token appreciates to $100, the same transaction costs .0005 REQ. That's how I'm thinking about the burn working. So, in my quick analysis, as the price increases, the burn rate slows down. 

What this means is that at 1 billion market cap, the burn rate is pretty quick - the price of REQ appreciates rapidly, but at over a hundred billion dollars of quarterly transactions, the fees are high enough that they eat into the number of tokens really quickly. In 3 years, over half of the tokens are burned. After 25 years, all but 3 million of the tokens are burned. Of course, multiply that number of tokens by like 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 because of the decimal places, but still, it's a pretty shocking number. After 88.25 years, you get down to below a single token.

On the other hand, if you start out at $10 a token with 10 billion market cap, you basically skip the first 10 years of high burn rate at the lower market cap and save yourself about 900 million REQ being burned. After 25 years, the price of REQ is $17.715 at the 10 billion market cap constant and you still have 564MM REQ to burn.

Of course, $100 is even better. You skip another 9.5 years of the 1 billion market cap scenario, and after 25 years your REQ is worth $105.87 per token and there are still 945 MM left to burn.

Hope this helps someone with their concerns. If you notice any errors or have any questions, lemme know.

**Scenario 1**:
I live in Europe and I want EUROs. A business client lives in the States and has USD.

I hear there's this thing called REQ so I open a request and I get wired the money.

Everywhere on this sub, it is stated this will *somehow* be cheaper than IBAN/BIC/SEPA payments.

But it's built *on top* of existing systems and I'm not actually being paid in REQ, so the money will still need to go to an exchange, be converted, and be wired across borders, with the exchange taking a cut. And I will have to pay REQ on top. Making it more expensive.

How is currency being converted with the aid of REQ?

**Scenario 2**:
I'm in the US, buy something from an online store, and hit the pay with REQ button. I have litecoin, bitcoin, zcash, and USD at my disposal. Do I have an option of choosing my currency? Will it display the different fees for each? Will it be cheaper if I pay with, for example, litecoin?

I, however, choose to pay with USD. How does the money actually get from my account to the vendors? It looks like it will still have to go via bank transfer or VISA, for which I'll have to pay fees. And I will have to pay REQ on top. Making it more expensive.

I travel a bit around the world, one hustle for me is to buy transportation tickets for the tube essentially.

I think it would be great to have partnership with SNCF (France) or DeutschBahn for starters. You guys have a french legacy and based in Berlin.

In theory with the currency management you have or plan to integrate I think this would work insanely well.

You buy your ticket with request network, no matter where you are, your ticket and its validity countdown or relative information (even integration of QR code like airports?) are attached to the transaction. when the controller arrives, you can simply show your transaction proof and voila.

It would also be great to get rid of those printed tickets that got thrown away.

Another big big big advantage will be the bill management for corporate reimbursement made much more easy. it will fix the final price with more accuracy when filling up for travel reimbursement.

Let's say that the platform allows people to transfer USD between parties. There would be a few conversions along the way (USD =&gt; REQ =&gt; USD), so that the request could be put onto the blockchain using REQ tokens.  In this scenario, is the amount of REQ transferred proportionate to the amount of USD transferred?  If so, then I assume that the value of REQ tokens increases as the aggregate value of requests increases (because there are a limited number of REQ tokens in circulation; without minting many more tokens, the value must increase to accommodate for a higher transaction volume).


Alternatively, given the above scenario, does the blockchain request simply include metadata indicating the amount to be transferred, such that the amount of REQ tokens used to execute the transaction is unrelated to the quantity of $$ transferred?  For instance, could a single REQ token be used to transfer $1 USD, or $1,000 USD?  If this is the case, then the value of REQ must increase relative to the *total number* of transactions (regardless of the $ amount transferred), since each transaction has an associated cost of executing the smart contract request.


Lastly, I imagine a scenario where a new company wishes to offer a service using the Request Network.  This company would need a supply of REQ to enable its use of the Request Network in providing customers with their service.  If REQ grows in popularity as a medium for exchange, then the demand from companies to purchase REQ (necessary to fuel the services they provide) would increase, thereby driving up the price of REQ tokens.


Or, is it simpler than this?  Because REQ has a limited supply (which decreases over time through burning), is it just a scarce resource whose demand will increase as use of the Request Network increases, such that its value is just based on supply and demand?


Which (if any) of these is correct?  ",NA,"7jsucx",NA,0,NA,"false",1515330433,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","false","linkflairlabel","","false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/7jsucx/how_exactly_does_the_value_of_req_tokens_increase/",NA,"",NA,"Question","",0,0

It’s my understanding that with Req the idea is that people will be able to request payments, whether they be in crypto or fiat, for goods and services. Is this the basic premise of the platform? If that’s true than what gives the token it’s value? If everyone uses, say, Bitcoin and USD to make purchases on the platform, then why would the Req token hold any value? Does it give the holder any voting rights in regards to the roadmap of the technology like district0x, basically acting as a security related to the technology and development team?

My questions are:
How do I go about making that happen? Do I simply just send my REQ to my ETH wallet address? How do I get it back if I do that? Is it even worth doing this or should I wait for an official wallet/Exodus support?

so fast-forward to present day.  i've been sharing my knowledge of crypto with family and friends in hopes that they might come to realize the magnitude of this opportunity.  in doing so, my brother told me that a laborer he had hired 3 yrs ago preferred to pay him in bitcoin, but my brother had refused.  so yeah, the plumber story popped up to the forefront of my mind.  i had a second experience today that took things up a notch for me.  i was at city hall sitting around some baby-boomers ripe for retirement.  they were city bus drivers ready to receive their defined benefit pension plans. (hope your kids are hyperindustrious, because sustaining the boomer generation is going to drown us all along with our children.) even these technologically incompetent boomers were bitcoin holders. 

anyway, i took a breath...  considered the stock crash of 2008... and i realized that what we are dealing with here is completely different and even less predictable.  bullish or bearish candlesticks don't mean anything in crypto.  i don't believe in TA at all anymore.  the fundamental assumptions with TA are that charts are a sufficient representation of consumer behaviour, and those behaviors somehow encompass causality.  but in the stock market, the 'plumbers' (this is a metaphor now, i hope i've made that clear) weren't a huge part of the action.  the cryptosphere does not have the same composition of holders. the 'plumbers' are killing it on BTC. the market is made up of many emotionally-driven opportunists that are looking to sweeten their retirement pots.

i've written this all out because i want to say that i believe in REQ.  i don't care what happens with BTC -- if it bursts or rises, i don't really care.  i don't care if REQ falls or rises in the short term either.  i'm invested in REQ because i think it will be largely immune to a BTC bubble burst, whenever that might happen.  great that the boomer opportunists made 4x returns on BTC over the last 2 months, but REQ will solve major challenges facing broader crypto implementation globally.  my REQ is on a ledger nano s, where it will stay for a while.  for once, i feel confident that i will be able to pass on a financial advantage to my children.  REQ may well be the future.

for the record, i have nothing against tradespeople.  i worked in the trades myself earlier in my life.  i am simply saying that the market is no longer made up of familiar forces, so maybe we should focus on supporting endeavors that we believe in (like REQ), and stop focusing on local fluctuations.

looking forward to comments and thoughts.  have a nice day everyone.",NA,"7j7kxd",NA,0,NA,"false",1515319283,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","false","linkflairlabel","","false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/7j7kxd/a_story_about_my_confidence_in_req/",NA,"",NA,"Moon","",0,1

I have always been a relatively poor man, up until this year. I come from a troubled background, left school before graduating, never had a good job or many prospects. I have been interested in cryptocurrency for years, but never had much to invest. I had a couple of bitcoin stashed away, and as of this year I no longer consider myself of the verge of poverty; which is a great feeling. :).  
I bought some Ethereum last year too when it was less than $100 each, and again at around $150, and with the gains both of my coins have made I have become increasingly interested in the future of money: cryptocurrency.  
I have been on the hunt for a coin whose potential is great, but with a low market cap, and that brought me here. Request network is an amazing project, with so much real-world business application I felt it was a good idea to take a chunk of my BTC, and trade it for some REQ. Now, I know BTC is the golden goose, and I still love it dearly, but I feel other, newer coins have better growth potential.  
The thing is, I am not a software developer. I don't understand code, or a lot of the technical aspects of the crypto world that I feel would guide me with truer aim. So, I am kind of taking a shot in the dark with this project, as I know it is fairly early in its development.  
I wanted to ask the community here at r/requestnetwork: how do you see the future of REQ? Do you see the potential failure of REQ itself? Do you think mainstream adoption is a pipe-dream, or simply so distant that it may as well be? Do you see REQ 'mooning'?  
What are your own personal thoughts, feelings, and expectations for the future (hopeful) growth of my now beloved REQ?

RequestNetwork is interesting but I had a few questions as I read the RequestNetwork whitepaper

Invoicing seems to be an amazing layer to add onto blockhain technology. I also love that the idea from an operational perspective that you can see the ""credit worthiness"" of a customer by veiwing their public history of transacations.

 While great from an operational standpoint I don't stand to see how this will change an audit significantly. Some of the things that come to mind when arriving at that conclusion are: 

- What prevents an entity from sending multiple invoices for the same sale? In accrual accounting, outstanding invoices at year period-end for services/goods provided are accrued for and accounted for as revenue. This in theory would allow Management to record sales that did not exist. However, from a positive side, this system definitely removes the auditing requirements of the completeness of sales

- Will this system help with the classification aspect of auditing at all? For example, selling a car not as a part of inventory isn't a sale, and shouldn't be accounted for in the revenue line item. Does requestnetwork consider this for accounting purpose, or is it up to the Company to have a secondary system do this coding of accounts elsewhere? 

I'm sure I can come up with more questions. But for now, I'd be interested in hearing about what you all think about the above. None the less I see the potential, I could see how this could assist with auditing the occurrence and completeness of transactions but given some questions above not sure complete reliance could be given

Request is a decentralized network which allows anyone to request a payment (a Request Invoice), where the recipient is able to pay in a secure way and all the information is stored in a decentralized authentic ledger. This results in cheaper, easier and more secure payments and allows a wide range of automation possibilities on top of it. See: [Whitepaper](https://request.network/assets/pdf/request_whitepaper.pdf).

&amp;nbsp;

**What problems does this project solve?**

Payment systems are inefficient and not ready for the digital and IoT (Internet of Things) revolution currently taking place. Request Network aims to be a currency agnostic payment system, allowing users to send and receive both crypto and fiat currencies, with currency conversions being performed on the fly (typically by the Kyber decentralised exchange, though other options will be available).

Commonly referred to as PayPal 2.0, Request Network are not aiming to solely compete with PayPal. There are broader use cases, for example in auditing, accountancy, IoT, public spending. Please see this [mindmap](https://www.mindmeister.com/991002501?t=R1iofDilV0) for use cases.

&amp;nbsp;

**Is there a roadmap?**

The roadmap can be found on the Request Network [website](https://request.network/#/).

&amp;nbsp;

**What is the token used for?**

*Fees*

The REQ ERC20 token is required to participate in the network. When using the network participants will pay a network fee in REQ, which will be burned. This fee will be 0.05-0.5% of the transaction value, with this percentage decreasing as network volume increases. The user should be aware they will also pay the network fees for any blockchain they make use of as well as any additional services, for example if a Request for BTC is fulfilled using ETH, there would be a fee for transfering the ETH, a Kyber fee for converting to BTC, and a fee for the BTC transaction. 

*Governance*

One of the major challenges to a decentralised system is decision making. If the Request Network is to survive and flourish, there must be a system for governance. Here the intention is to use the REQ token for voting rights, with plans to create the necessary tools for administration and potentially a chat system.

*Financial independence*

The intention is to create a financial ecosystem which is not dependant on monetary policy in other currencies. Request should be as independent as possible from ETH inflation/deflation. In future it is highly likely that miners/stakers will be able to upgrade to Casper, and accept ERC20 tokens as gas.This independence will allow Request to hard fork to a new system with a new technology by keeping the same token holders ecosystem.

*Technical independence*

It is possible that in the process of scaling Request a solution such as Plasma Chains will be used. In this solution a specific token is used to secure the network via PoS (Proof of Stake). Using a token is the most flexible and independent way to conceptualize a system that will need consensus and security to evolve in the long term.

&amp;nbsp;

**What is the purpose of burning tokens? Isn't that just wasting them?**

1) Value added for investors - token burning decreases supply, increasing scarcity. 
2) Burned to actually use the network - very small percentage of the transaction total value burned in REQ. This allows the network to be used and gives incentive to others to hold the token and manage gateways.
Token burning is similar to share repurchasing in the traditional stock market. By reducing the supply of tokens, demand may increase, providing value to holders by increasing the price per token.

&amp;nbsp;

**What happens when the token runs out?**

Burning is a percentage of the value of the transaction (0.05-0.5%), so less REQ should be used over time. It would take an extremely long time before there is a danger of the tokens running out, there are currently 18 decimals points (so that would be the minimum circulating supply), but a fork can be used to add more decimals points if required.

&amp;nbsp;

**Which wallet to use?**

&amp;nbsp;

**How will Request handle Fiat?**

Option 1: Chainlink Oracle

Option 2: Tokenized Fiat Currency

Option 3: Purpose built Oracle with banks

Option 4: Oracle built with third party banking Oracles e.g Bankin, Mint or Sofort

Option 5: Partnership with Credit Card Providers e.g Mastercard or Credit Card Businesses e.g Stripe

&amp;nbsp;

**Can Ethereum scale to meet Requests needs? What if it doesn't?**

It's very likely that Ethereum will successfully scale using the below technologies.

[Sharding](https://blog.rexmls.com/sharding-raiden-plasma-the-scaling-solutions-that-will-unchain-ethereum-c590e994523b) (breaking the network up into smaller chains).

[Plasma](https://blog.rexmls.com/sharding-raiden-plasma-the-scaling-solutions-that-will-unchain-ethereum-c590e994523b) (separate chains with layers).

[Casper](https://blockonomi.com/ethereum-casper/) (Proof of Stake, so there will be more people confirming transactions).

[Raiden](https://raiden.network/) (RDN token, offchain transactions, similar to the lightning network planned for BTC).

If ETH fails to scale, Request can move to a new blockchain, provided that chain supports Smart Contracts (e.g. NEO). Tokens would be exchanged 1:1.

&amp;nbsp;

**If all transactions are public, why would a business use Request?**

Transactions are not necessarily public, Ethereum are implimenting [ZK-Snarks](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/12/05/zksnarks-in-a-nutshell/) which will allow private transactions.

&amp;nbsp;

**What partnerships have Request Network formed? Do they need these partnerships to succeed?**

I like many of the concepts, but I am having a hard time reconciling some answers to the below questions after reading both the white and yellow papers as to how REQ actually works.

Question 1. (Context: REQ Architecture) Is there any solid documentation or presentations in regards to the structure of how the underlying REQ blockchain architecture works? The majority of the content in the white and yellow papers seems to be so focused around the benefits of implementing REQ (and the yellow paper is significantly less technical than I was hoping--with the exception of some invoice attribute details and WCGWs) without explicitly defining the flow of a transaction in regards to the REQ technical architecture.

For example, in the example on whitepaper page 3 in regards to the Bob and Alice example, who exactly is running the blockchain that REQ is generating and processing invoices through? I'm going to assume that at onset of the project, the REQ team manages the network. If so, what are the long term plans in regards to opening up participation to the public for blockchain immutability? If my assumption is correct that the REQ team manages the blockchain, how then is this a decentralized, trustless method of maintaining data for audits, or even more importantly, a true blockchain? This brings me to my next question.

Question 2. (Whitepaper, Page 7): ""This [core] layer is free to encourage the greatest number to use it and to discourage the development of other systems. The only costs transmitted are the use of Ethereum gas and the storage of information.""

From an underlying value standpoint, this to me is where you would want to the token to provide value. Without the token being used at the protocol level, how do you develop a network that creates incentives and competition for independent data processors to maintain the blockchain? I would think that the core protocol of REQ would create the need for the token--it would be used as the settlement currency for participants of the protocol: data processors who provide the network for Bob and Alice to process their invoices would be paid in REQ. Furthermore, for matters like invoice storing etc, I would think you would want REQ tokens required at the protocol level to ensure that data storage providers are paid, specific to each transaction, which represents the initiation of a data charge. Is this what is occurring and I have misread? 

My biggest underlying problem right now is not that the token is unnecessary--but to the contrary, the documentation indicates that the tokens underlying value is further down the REQ chain, not at the forefront of the protocol. Sorry if I missed these answers in any other documentation.

The wording and tone of the whitepaper is awkward in many places, and the whitepaper gives the vibe that the token was tacked on, instead of envisioned in the core structure of how the network runs, imo. I believe that it is necessary at the core protocol, in order to ensure economic independency of the protocol.

Question 3. What methods does a company or individual who participates in the REQ network have in regards to privacy of their data? I strongly believe in the benefits that blockchain provides to commerce, but one of the topics that I'm not clear on is how the REQ network provides an auditable public ledger while also shielding details that no business would want publicly accessible (e.g how much company X charges Client A vs. Client B for the same service). I understand that the actual invoices themselves can be stored offchain, but it doesn't take a trained auditor to access the attributes listed in the yellow paper that each REQ possesses (e.g. payor/payee identity, total amount requested, etc) and figure out some highly sensitive financial data for companies and individuals.

Thanks in advance for any answers!

I saw REQ jump to 1.20 and was absolutely thrilled. Then the crash happened… I saw REQ drop to 35 cents, more than halving my investment into it. I was absolutely discouraged and couldn’t help but start to doubt the decisions I have made. However, as the saying goes, patience is a virtue.

My relationship with crypto has more often than not been met with lows from the get go. I made my first crypto investment back in 2014, buying about $100 worth of dogecoin (don’t even get me started about my logic behind this investment lol). About a month later, I saw that investment drop to about $20. I decided to give up on crypto and just forget about that investment. Then recently (about mid last year), in one of my college courses, a couple of friends started to talk about ethereum and crypto. I decided to look back into crypto and saw the price of dogecoin had gone up and my investment from 2014 was not worth about $300. Thankfully, I had a backup wallet stored onto a flash drive. I tried recovering the wallet and failed, so I gave that up. Months later (late last month or early this month I believe?), I saw dogecoin reach an even higher price, making my initial investment $650 (around 30x from the low point) and took it into my own hands to recover the wallet. I successfully did so and used those funds and put it into REQ. After selling my dogecoin, I saw the price jump even higher, which would have brought my initial investment to over $1,000 (but that’s beside the point…). 

This was not the only roller coaster ride I have had with crypto. Back when I tried to recover my doge wallet for the first time and gave up, I decided to give crypto another shot and put $200 in. I bought into WINGS (I believe?) and once again, I saw that initial investment drop to about $28. I found ARK and decided to throw the remainder of that $28 into ARK around last August. Once again, I decided to forget about it as $28 wasn’t really worth it to me. Months later, that $28 became about $140 (still a loss from the initial $200, but $28 to $140 is nothing to scoff at), which was also invested into REQ later on (and again ARK decided to go even higher from my selling point, but again besides the point lol…). 

Crypto has left me with many doubts and regrets. Why did I invest in this? What would’ve happened had I put more money into this coin at this point? And on and on and on. The key message I am trying to get out is PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE. It can be discouraging to see REQ drop in price or be relatively stagnant at a certain price point while other coins are going up, but more often than not, patience will be rewarded. I can’t see if it will be a few days, few weeks, a few months, or even a few years, but all I know is that I believe in REQ and their vision. My only current regret is that I wished I had more fiat to put into REQ!

At this point, we need to believe in the REQ team and their vision. We shouldn’t be doubting ourselves or the team. We should be supporting them in any possible way that we can. Whether you are a developer that is looking to get involved in the community such as myself or not, you could do something simple such as sending encouraging messages to the team through social media. I know personally, if I have the support and encouragement of others, I am able to work harder and get stuff done at a better pace.

To end this PSA, I leave you all with one final message. Carry on my fellow REQmarines and cheers to a bright future ahead!",NA,"7sua5u",NA,1,NA,"false",1518581897,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","false","linkflairlabel","","false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/7sua5u/psa_to_those_discouraged_by_reqs_price_movement/",NA,"",NA,"Discussion","",0,1

Cards require additional log-ins and verifications, and it is an extra accessory a person can lose. Additionally, when we have projects like REQ and OMG, you can pay faster with your phone from and to any currency that you ever could with a card. Or in the more distant future, we probably can pay with a single swipe without ever having to stand in lines. 

This is why I am such a fanboy of the REQ-WTC relationships. Here's an example: 
You walk into a store, and walk out with an item. The RFID gate identifies that let’s say 1 white tshirt left the store, and based on that information the AI uses face detection algorithm to determine who the person leaving with the shirt is. Then, a smart contract is executed, where the store’s software (based on RFID and AI information) send the person a Request for payment, for which he/she can pay with a single swipe in any currency.

REQ is also looking for IoT integration yes, and they have a 30M fund set a side to incentivise it. They could marry their efforts and I'd be the happiest dude alive

[Excerpt from Technical Roadmap for Reference](https://i.imgur.com/ieTbQpF.png) 

I've done searches and found little conversation around accounting vs payment system (""Paypal 2.0"") and wanted to open a discussion - let me know if there are similar posts that I can read!

One of the key concepts in accounting (and especially in auditing) is **granularity**. Example:

- Income of 1,000,000 can be broken down into:
 - 800,000 operating revenue
 - 200,000 capital gains, which include

      - 300,000 gain from sales/disposal
      - (100,000) carry-forward loss

How can Request facilitate the process of matching the descriptions of line items on a financial statement to source documents (or rather transaction hashes on blockchain)? This seems like a complicated process for businesses that may lack the expertise in reporting and compliance. 

Will the accounting system be geared towards larger corporate entities or could it potentially reach down to individual levels where an average Joe can use it to report personal income tax?

A recent poster asked for REQ FUD from the community. I created this reddit account with the intention of auditing upcoming 'hyped' coins, so without believing I would find much or anything for REQ, that's what I set out to do. 

My concern lies with the content and rate of code development. The following is copied from my response to the initial call for FUD. 

-----------------------------


The github is... abysmal. 

The team has two developers listed. Vincent Rolland as the lead engineer, and Elliot Dennis as a full stack engineer.

Vincent is the main developer for the Request.js codebase. This is the core library. Request.js has a total of 143 total commits and very little code. Days go by where only very minor commits are made (a misspelling of a word is fixed...) The code has virtually no documentation. There is no real testing suite to be seen. It in no way resembles enterprise code. It looks more like someone's side project. Feel free to check out the commits for yourself: https://github.com/RequestNetwork/requestNetwork.js/commits/master.

Elliot Dennis, the full stack engineer, appears to have made his first github contribution in 2016, indicating at least that he's relatively new to professional development - although of course he may just not have used github before then. Elliot's contribution so far is in the form of 98 commits, amounting to the simple web app which is their colossus alpha. It's a tiny web app. It makes a few calls to Request.js and it displays information. That appears to be the total sum of 2 months work. 

Some of REQ's goals:

* Request works with every global currency.
* Request is designed to be flexible, to last hundreds of years, and to work with IoT, whilst being compatible with any future systems.
* Financial invoicing

I understand that it's clearly a work in progress, but at this rate it will take years and years of development to reach any of these milestones. The code is updated every few days with minor edits and additions. Financial invoicing is not even remotely close to being part of this project yet. The team has two developers who are being asked to undertake mammoth tasks, and from what I can see are not equipped to do so in the timeframes given. I have seen more code and more work in university group projects. 

Feel free to compare it to the github of [Raiblocks](https://github.com/clemahieu/raiblocks) with 2435 commits and mountains of dense intricate code, testing suites, and 22 contributors constantly working on it. Notwithstanding the fact that Raiblocks may have its own issues, that's the sort of github you want to see - not this. 

---------------------

If other devs would like to take a look at the code and share their thoughts I'd be happy to hear them, as there may be facets to this project I'm not seeing.

&gt;REQ tokens are ERC20 tokens which are necessary to participate in the network, create advanced Requests and reward various parties who will help build the request ecosystem.

&gt;When using the network, the participants will need to pay a network fee in REQ which will be burned.

Does this mean that someone using the request network needs to already have REQ tokens to complete a transaction? If so, that seems prohibitive to it taking market share from Paypal or Venmo where users don't need a separate currency to pay for transactions.

Alternatively, if REQ is purchased and then burned as part of a transaction fee that can be paid in any currency without the user having to interact with REQ, isn't that just adding a pointless layer if its only purpose is to be burned?

Maybe I am misunderstanding, but is there a good reason that the request network needs to have its own token?",NA,"7qhsju",NA,0,NA,"false",1518537903,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","false","linkflairlabel","","false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/7qhsju/why_is_the_req_token_necessary_to_the_request/",NA,"",NA,"Question","",0,1

This will avoid clogging of the ETH network, and prevent the mass hysteria and GAS wars.

b) We can start with crypto websites, and crypto-related websites (ICO review sites, Youtubers, bloggers) and ask them to integrate this button along with Paypal/Patreon/other donation buttons that they use.

I can't find anywhere in the whitepaper where it states how many tokens were minted? Various ICO-reviews I've found fluctuates from about 700M to 1B which is also what is shown in cmc. Were all of the supply available to the public sold? If not, what happend to the remaining tokens?

How many of the tokens were kept by the founders, how are they to be spent?

I see some of the tokens are burned during use, have the founders stated that no new tokens will be minted?

REQ requires a decentralized oracle in order for the project to work. In the REQ white paper they even say they're working with a blockchain oracle.

The only decentralized oracle project being worked in all of Crypto is Chainlink.

My question is what at all is the point of holding REQ tokens for profit over LINK? In order for REQ to succeed LINK has to succeed, and LINK's  oracle has more use cases.


Tldr;

REQ is like investing in Toyota. LINK is like investing in land with oil.

So Recently I got interested in Cryptocurrency and since a week or so I’ve been lurking on a few subreddits and spent my time reading and watching some videos. So I’m a total noob indeed… I want to take this year to play around a little with different coins and decide if I’m confident enough to invest more in 2019.

Life is pretty busy at this point and I’m not getting into this to take high risks and get rich fast (job is skyrocketing and my main goal) but I feel like it’s something I could enjoy. And active practicing is more fun than passive learning so I’ve decided I’m going to learn while practicing. I’ve come up with a little plan and I was hoping the more experienced among us could help me by sharing their thoughts.

The goal of making this plan is to think ahead and don’t let feelings and news interfere. I could see Crypto currencies  becoming more mainstream further down the road so I’m not scared of a few potholes. But it has to have an element in which I have to interfere by making decisions so I have to do research and learn along the way.

So my idea is to jump in with €300 divided into equal parts over 6 coins. I’m thinking REQ, XRB, XVG, XRP , ETH and BCH. First 4 because of their potential in the next few years, last 2 because I could see them do a (little) jump this year. These thought are solely based on what I’ve read on the internet the past week so by no means is this a well educated decision. So I’m open to suggestions. The reason I’m dividing it in (too?) small amounts is so I force myself to read more about different coins.

Once I’ve set this up (I’ve got fiat on Coinbase ready to transfer to Kucoin, Binance and Kraken) I want to invest €50 more each month. Ideally in one of the 6 coins I already invested in at this point. Maybe the one with the lowest rate at that moment… Don’t really know yet but it would be nice if it’s based on some kind of system so I can see if this would work out in the long run. I don’t think wallets at this point are necessary (am I wrong?), but in a few months I want to start experimenting with those. 

The stakes are low, but nevertheless I hope some of you find this an interesting approach and care to  share your thoughts. Any recommendations about articles or people who to follow are much appreciated. Thanks.

Check the latest gas prices. Binance is gouging its customers","This is Binance's latest explanation on why the withdrawal fees are so high for ERC20 token:

&gt; In order to address this, we must first look at the Ethereum blockchain. This image (http://prntscr.com/hyrjmm) shows the growth of Ethereum transactions since the release of Ethereum. You can see that recently there has been an exponential increase in the volume of transactions occurring on the Ethereum Blockchain. What this means is that transaction fees are very competitive right now. If you want your transaction to be prioritised, you are required to pay higher miner fees. Our dynamic system is configured to set the fees to the equivalent of 0.01 ETH/ withdrawal. This amount does not change based on the quantity you withdraw in one withdrawal because on blockchain, a $50 transfer paying a $5 fee is treated the exact same as a $500,000 transfer paying a $5 fee.

https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/7qxig5/binance_updates_and_suggestions/

""release the mainnet version of our product and create and grow the ecosystem.""

1. The mainnet  
2. Management of other cryptocurrencies

First, grats to everyone who's helped build and contribute to REQ, and all the investors who've been part of REQ's journey! Sounds like there's something awesome here!

I like the idea - a universal, low-fee, blockchain-based payment request gateway(?). There's *MASSIVE* value in that, as someone who is familiar with the financial industry and with crypto. However, I am either confused or misunderstanding something.

My question is this: If request supports transactions regardless of currency, how is the transfer of other currencies managed or validated? ie how does one pay '3 chickens' or '10,000 BTC' to the other using Request? 

Also, if that's the case, then what role does REQ play? Is REQ used as the cost of sending these invoices/requests? 

Now, I'm also aware I could be completely off - the above sounds too good to be true. It could be that REQ itself is the store of value and is the only thing that gets moved around, in which case the main difference between other cryptos is the protocol for how it gets moved around... Admittedly that's less exciting, but I'm open to hearing reasons why that would be exciting (over other cryptos)!

Its ease of use and consolidated nature of what seems like an over-complicated system struck me right away.

My main question that i still have yet to wrap my newbie brain around is how does the token/coin itself obtain and keep value.  I read something in the whitepaper about coin burning but this was a bit over my head.  If it can transfer any currency, say 15 ETH from person A for a car to person B for say $15,000, where does REQ come into play.  Is it at all similar to what Ripple does where, in place of the interim IOU that the traditional system currently uses (SWIFT?) XRP is a real time transferable asset exchanging hands?  That's not what I got from this but it's the only way i'm seeing value in REQ.

Congratulations to them who holded request in down trend. We are mooning now.

While btc rising, alt coin market is crashing... We are holding altcoin(request) why should Bitcoin affect us. 

So main reason behind sudden price drop (in btc quantity) of request coin(any Alts) is week hands...

You may heard that ""you never loss until you sell"" same thing I wanted to say you that if you bought any coin and if it goes down, do not panic sell. 

Suppose you bought coin, that goin gone down, now you sold in panic, then one giant big news or event related to that coin gives sudden rise...you will regret lot.

Buy high, sell low isn't gonna make you rich.

Only invest money which you can afford to lose. I am sure if you do this, if invested coin goes down, you won't matter.

This is a buy time, buy buy buy. All the best.  We are holding. 

Mark my words, selling now will cost you lot.  (Current rate of REQ = 4545 satoshi, 0.73$)

UPDATE : (My comment when request gone below 4k satoshi today..

 already seen same cases many time when btc took off for new ath. Everything settle in green when btc becomes stable. So why to sell in loss and miss the original investment + wished profit from it.)

1) Create a REQ tipbot for tipping users across reddit: imagine you tip users on tech related subs. They get curious about their tip and find this subreddit. These are some of the people that might actually build on top of request, not your average crypto investor.


2) Create an official FAQ for every new user that is interested in Request Network: To understand what this is all about, we need a good summary in an official FAQ. There needs to be a link to it in the tip bot.


3) Create a Wikipedia page for Request Network: every non reddit user needs to be able to find out more about this platform. Wikipedia is the obvious choice!

Im fairly new to the crypto world and as soon as i got in to the world i started to speculate about the future payments. Thats how i found request and i am a big fan!

I have some questions or ideas which i havent really found elsewhere and if there is any token that should have this feature it should be Req.
What if the requester could decide, on forehand, to split the income and have it sent to diffrent adresses.
Example: if i own a store which sells organic local food. For each farmer i set up diffrent percentages. Like farmer A wants 60% of the sales whild farmer B settle with 50%. Then i settle with the logistics to have a percentage of 5% and i get the rest.
When i scan the item, some software are needed, the program connects the farmer to the volume and calculates how much tokens to be sent to whom. This would mean that the farmers could be paid in real time.

As i said before, Im new to this and this might already exist But Hey, if it does.. please tell me.

Sorry for my bad english, Im not native.

Not trying to raise FUD, I'm just interested in investing based on appropriate responses. I tried searching, but I cant find much information on the reputation system since its not coming til late 2018. 

 &amp;nbsp;

1. What stops malicious user X from spamming invoices to big company Y to create a large list of open requests?  
2. It seems once X posts a request R, company Y can accept the request and this results in payment (depending on the contract) from Y -&gt; X. Is there a mechanism in which Y can reject the request R and mark it as invalid/illegitimate? 
3. What stops someone from creating multiple accounts and spamming invoices between them to create a high reputation account (i.e. buying reputation)?

 &amp;nbsp;

A malicious user X may create a lot of invoices for two reasons:

* A lot of large open requests to company Y would make it look like company Y does not pay its bills on time, and as a result reduces Y's reputation.
* Company Y looking at their requests will have to filter through the spam in order to work out which ones to pay. They might accidentally pay the spammers invoice.

 &amp;nbsp;

It seems users have to pay to create a request, so the disincentive to malicious user X is that it costs money to spam requests. So now we have two scenarios -

1. Creating a request is cheap (lets say, 1c)

2. Creating a request is expensive (lets say, $1)


 &amp;nbsp;

In scenario (1), spamming is not cost prohibitive. If i spam a company with a 1000 invoices for $10, I only need one to be accepted to make my money back. Alternatively, i just spent $10 to hurt company Y.


In scenario (2), spamming is probably going to be cost prohibitive. (Though, given a target with enough money, maybe they might just pay out an invoice for $1k or something.)
However, that means its also too expensive to use the REQ network for micro transactions, and you lose a large target market. 

 &amp;nbsp;


So it probably makes more sense to keep creating requests cheap (scenario 1) and creating mitigating factors to stop the spam. I think I read you can set limits, e.g. company Y automatically ignores any request for &lt; $10 or company Y automatically ignores requests from someone who doesnt have N reputation points. 
But this leads to question (2).

 &amp;nbsp;

If I want to 'ignore' a request, does the request just lie around forever? It would be better if there is a way to reject a request. 
Rejecting a request should have a different cost in the reputation system to ignoring a request/letting it lapse. 

 &amp;nbsp;

There should be a big difference between the following statements:

* ""Company Y has a lot of outstanding requests"", 

* ""Company Y has rejected a lot of requests from high reputation senders"",
* ""Company Y has rejected a lot of requests of from low reputation senders"",

The first two are negative, the third one should not be too negative.

 &amp;nbsp; 

Finally, if reputation can have a big impact, and theres an incentive to increase my reputation - can't I just buy it by trading with myself?

My question is for accountants, be they personal or corporate. 

A lot of RN’s promotional material talks about public accounting disclosure. They say this speeds up accounting, saves money, and the transparency is beneficial to entities that have gov oversight. 

But do companies want that kind of transparency? I know taxes and accounting (in USA) are on the public record so maybe this just speeds that process up. But I always thought that companies do a lot of “interesting” accounting, whether to hide ideas from competitors or to hide things from the public/government. 

Would that not hinder RN adoption? Or is this case a few bad apples don’t determine the future. 

Or is RN’s intent to make accounting transparent on a software level so that accounting processes happen faster? Like the inventory at a store? 

Tl/Dr: why would people want automatic transparency with accounting?  ",NA,"7op8mo",NA,0,NA,"false",1518504970,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","false","linkflairlabel","","false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/7op8mo/accountants_of_rn_a_question/",NA,"",NA,"Question","",0,0

After reading the whitepaper (and understanding it as best as I could) I moved some of my eth out and bought a small amount.  I was happy to HODL as I still am as I genuinely think this is a brilliant project with everything going for it in the longterm (even more so after seeing that vid of the use cases on the iphone the other day).  Now obviously the benefit of the last few weeks is I have watched my little pot increase ten fold which is obviously nice.  I am now thinking I would like to look at other coins to maybe move some ETH into them.  I was wondering what other people think are good coins for an investment that have the same sort of background and market value as REQ (either out now or incoming ??)

I just wanted to give a message to any that are just starting their crypto journey some advice.

I'm doing this from a throw away account from a computer not linked to me in anyway using an international proxy because I've always been the paranoid type.

I've had a knack during this crypto bonanza over the last few years of finding prospects and growing ungodly wealth from them. Since this was trading below ICO value back in the day I phoned my brother in law and 6 other calls to family/friends and gave them the run down of RN and what I was doing.

I didn't encourage them to buy, although surely my phone call triggered that. I received a good amount of thanks and well wishes for my tip and slept well that night.

Most of my people know nothing about crypto but invest now because of me, and this is advice to anybody that invests/speculates heavily in this space and has realized, or may not have yet realized, the potential for wealth that is here. My one piece of advice that I don't see anywhere is: GIVE YOUR CLOSEST THE OPTION.

What I learned during this time, is that if you go from 0 to 60 overnight, you may receive resentment from those you consider closest to you for not sharing with them. They may not say it outright and on the surface will congratulate you, but as you invite them over for your new house warming or take them on a family cruise for the next years reunion, they may wonder why you hadn't shared the tip or at least broached the subject so that they could join you on the next plane. 

Request Network is the next big thing, in my opinion, after analyzing progression of tech, team, and community all the way back to the whitelisting filling up. I've dropped ungodly sums in this space and turned it around into ridiculousness beyond my own imagination, and RN is my new baby I've went in deep on because it has all of the makings to become household in awareness and simplicity for the crypto'd and non-crypto'd as we enter a new era in currency.

I'm drinking heavily tonight in celebration for my latest victory here as I forecast the future of this in my own mind, so my thoughts and words may be scattered. I've seen serious percentages but I know this is just the beginning for RN, we're just touching potential currently.


To summarize, tell your family and loved ones. Whether they invest or not, it will at the very least give you peace of mind and RN will have that much more presence in the real world when adoption comes in a trickling effect. Don't shill, but present them the information to cover your own ass and sleep easy knowing you gave them the option and information. what they do with that is on them. When you are moving up in the world and those around you are not, relationships can change or be tested depending on how things play out. Make the right move with your loved ones.

I have also seen a demo of an existing app that acts as another web payment option in addition to Credit Card and PayPal, suitably named Pay with REQ.

While the roadmap to such an endeavor looks pretty rosy right now, the truly big money integrators are not going to just let REQ slip in as another option.  They must be forced to do so.

That being said, it is my belief that in addition to the multi-pronged approach to adoption REQ is pursuing now, another angle should be taken as well.

Bringing WordPress into the loop could enjoin adoption at the grass-roots level.  Development of a WP plugin which could easily add a ""Payment with Request"" option for web designers/developers to use in basic and WooCommerce based site builds might add another dimension of usage to their mix.

While this does not solve some of the larger site integration issues they may face, making things as easy as possible for lower end builds might help.

Just my two cents.

The lows have steeply risen 

**Shape:**  Since the surge has been so recent, I can only go by the past two days (which is not the most precise measurement, I admit).  In the past two days, it has formed a Bear-Flag shape.  This is a deceptive shape that appears after a drop.  It looks like an increase because it is shaped upward but it's really a sign that it's been trying to surge back to its previous high several times, but has failed to.  This reduces investors expectations of it surging again in the very near future.

**Stability**: The lows have certainly heightened substantially since the surge.  The highs have fallen slightly, but not as much. While there is some convergence, there is also still some fluctuation.

**Direction:** Possibly bearish short term.  Very bull-ish long term.

**Buy At:** I would definitely buy and hold this for the long term.  It's a great idea, a great team and its backed by Y Combinator, a company with a proven track record of success.  However, right now, I'm waiting for a correction before I buy more personally.

You can move your coins to MyEtherWallet, but once in MEW, it shows the balance in ETH, I made a search in this subreddit to find out the best way to move them, 

Is it as simple as taking the ETH address from MEW and sending the coins from Binance to there ?

Will the balance change from ETH to REQ ?

To be completely honest, I did not find any of their 'benefits' convincing. Regardless, I have a question about one of the mentioned points regarding 'Cost' - that using the Request Network means lower fees in comparison with services like Paypal and Stripe.

This would require adoption from both the merchant and customer. Large online retailers would firstly need to accept cryptocurrency as payment. Following that, they need to agree to use the Request Network. Even when that is done, there's also the issue of adoption from the customer side, who need to be willing to spend cryptocurrency and have an understanding of the Request network.

Isn't building up demand from two-sided markets difficult? Think of companies like AirBnb (finding people to list their houses and people willing to pay them for short term housing) and Uber (finding people to be drivers as well as people to take rides). Companies like these need to build up demand and supply at the same time.

How does Request aim to solve this chicken and egg problem? I couldn't find any answers from their whitepaper so I was hoping someone here could chime in.

I'm trying to understand the banking or crypto intermediaries for using Request. Does the end user need to have a Coinbase account or at least a digital wallet or can they pay with their phone? In the article I've linked below it says:

&gt; No need to input your credit card information or initiate a wire transfer. Instead, during the checkout, you will be able to pay using your browser or your phone — it will detect the request and ask you for confirmation. You only need to swipe left to reject or right to confirm the payment.

Let's use a phone for an example. I swipe left or right. Am I billed through the Google Play store? Is there a fee for that? What if I'm broke and live exclusively on credit cards? There's $100 in my bank account and I only make large purchases on Amazon (&gt; $500).

Common for anyone who is involved with Crypto, but just throwing some things out there!


1) REQ will experience a correction: No one knows when or how short it will be but it will correct! (Technically has had some natural dips so far in the past 2 days from just general market trading) so don't worry too much if it has a mini drop. I've seen the /r/Litecoin community freak out for a few weeks because it went to a 410 ish ATH and has been consolidating since. Don't freak out, as this project has LOADS of potential.

2) Dev posts are posted bi-weekly. The next one is January 5th. Though have some lower expectations for this one since it's been a holiday season so most big companies / coders / devs aren't as busy. They need time to relax, chill and take a mental break.

3) Main-net might not be announced this 5th, so don't worry if it isn't! With a lot of new money in the project, just know this isn't really a get rich quick coin. It might, but the main merits of this is the actual product itself. Easy to get partnerships with buisnesses / organizations if your project is on livenet ;). 

4) Main Net is going to launch Q1 2018. But, to keep everyone grounded still that could be anywhere from Jan 5th till March 31st. 

5) There will be REQ burn on full product, but it'll be pretty small and based on percentages of the amount used if I recall correctly.

6) Ideally, most people using their products wont even know they're using REQ in the long run. AKA possible to use with normal fiat as well!

7) If you haven't bought yet, you can do it easily on binance. Just need to have Ethereum, LTC, or BTC and trade it to your binance wallet for that coin. https://www.binance.com/ for the trading site for binance. (I'll include my refferal link here, but I know some people would prefer not people shilling their links) [https://www.binance.com/?ref=12297693]


Just a few comments, if anyone would like to add a bit more ""general nooby friendly"" comments or expand / correct on anything I commented do it! While price matters, long term this project is VERY promising!

My question is, considering I am using Binance as my exchange, what in your opinions is the best way to do so? Should I xfer the REQ into BTC, considering it is somewhat on the down now?

I've been in crypto since January 2017. My current portfolio is BTC, ETH, XLM, and DOGE (just for fun). I'm always looking for new coins to invest in, and REQ has peaked my interest. I'm being straightforward here, so no one mistakes me for an insincere FUD spreader. I am fairly conservative (for crypto), so I might ask tough questions to ensure REQ is a good investment for me. Please don't take this as FUD. 

1) What does REQ do that Venmo (or a hypothetical international Venmo) doesn't already do? The main selling point of REQ is it is like Paypal, but cheaper. That makes no sense to me. Venmo is owned by Paypal, and it has zero fees. It's completely free for me to transfer money on Venmo. So what does REQ bring to the table? Ive read two responses. First, Venmo doesn't allow crypto. Ok, so what? Fiat is always going to be the main currency, so if REQ wants to be profitable, it must compete with Venmo on Fiat. I frankly do not believe crypto will replace fiat, so if that's your argument, we will not agree unless you have some super uber evidence. Second, Venmo ACH transfer takes days. Ok, that's because of banks, not Venmo. If Venmo could do immediate transfers, it would. How will REQ resolve this?

2) I always need to ask this: what is bad about REQ? I never trust a product where its followers believe in it 100%. That's too good to be true. So I want to know, what do supporters of REQ dislike about it? What are the bad aspects? I ask this question not to FUD, but to understand the risks. 

Thanks! And be warned that I will challenge things you say if I do not understand them. Be prepared to defend! Think of me as an REQ buyer; you need to convince me to buy.

I believe crypto could be huge in the near future and I trust its potential as a way to make daily small transactions, rather than a way of speculation. That's the reason I felt in love with the project since day one.

The Request Network's community made me wanted to be a supporter of the project, and the current dip made me jump in. I'm glad I did not FOMO'd during the huge gains that happened recently, because I was about to jump around $.90/95. I think $.7 is the best price I could ever get (I was a crypto noob when I found REQ at $.3).

Just like many of you I woke up this morning expecting a pleasant update followed by genuinely interesting discussions about where the project is going from here, but after looking at reddit for a matter of seconds I realized that today is not the day for that. 

I've been watching request for a while and I can tell you that it seems to have its fair share of enemies. Plenty of people here like to spread FUD and and nonsense and today is certainly no exception. If comments about this update have made you uncertain about the future of this project just take a deep breath and realize that this is just the start of something much bigger, and if people are putting it down so much then maybe it's because they are invested in the competition! That being said, a certain dose of criticism is definitely necessary and welcome! 

I mainly wanted to post here today to remind you all that everyone has their own goals and motivations, so before you get scared off by hostile posts and comments just think about WHY these people may be so angry. Remember that greed makes people do awful things, and nothing good comes without criticism, especially on the internet!

It's going to be a bumpy road ahead, but keep your head high and don't let any crypto make you angry or sad. You're all loved and I'm looking forward to sharing in some wonderful experiences with you. 

Anywho, how you doin' today? ;)

I think I'm not the only one in this situation. I'm a developer (in my case a mobile developer) and I believe in REQ potential.

I read the update and the list of use cases where REQ could be used. It seems great but I'd appreciate more details. Is there any documentation of the upcoming API available? Is there any guideline we can read somewhere?

Request seems to have a very streamlined and intuitive vision for their payment system, one that anyone can use without thinking too hard about it. That's great!

But doesn't this convenience come at the cost of having to entrust your private key/payment info to a third party (does Request Network keep records of your private payment info)? How am I supposed to make payments without potentially compromising my private key?

1. Which such as high supply of REQ in circulation, would it make the growth of value for REQ slower than that of BTC?

2. Could the owners of REQ just flood the market (after-all 36% is huge fraction of the market to own) ?

I am an early investor in RN because I believe in its potential, but I recently realized I have investment strategy... I have no goal except to see the company grow, and even if/when RN grows and the market cap is $10B+ I don't know how I will make use of the gains. 

The current stock price (without token burning)  of roughly $1 implies that RN would need to handle between $2M-10M in transactions with 0% liabilities this year, based on the fee they decide to use. In order for such revenues, so I read through the whitepaper again and I'm trying to come up with my own (rough) valuation. 

BEFORE reading onward, please know that I have not been keeping up with the bi-weekly updates or have a complete understand of blockchain &amp; I hope the team didn't overlook these obsticles and I am just missing some information.

To reach such ambitious goals, here are some obsticles I found that RN will need to overcome:
1) Reputation score
2) Burning coins
3) Implementation IRL

1) I understand a huge value of blockchain is the anonymity offered. Wouldn't having a score on your account be the liability that people attempt to escape through blockchain?

2) Another key value of blockchain technology is the permanent ledger, allowing you to trace transactions if you tried hard enough (slight contradiction to 1, but you would still have to go through the person's ledger and judge for yourself + the ledger you end at wouldn't actually give any details about the person). The key part here is ""permanent"" - so wouldn't burning tokens undermine the purpose of blockchain again?

3) Accounting/audit firms already have access to many softwares that digitize their services, and there are still many businesses that don't make use of the services/softwares available. What would RN do in order to differentiate itself in the market?

Any insight on implementation strategies or projected revenue is also appreciated.",NA,"7px64i",NA,0,NA,"false",1518527068,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","false","linkflairlabel","","false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/7px64i/how_will_request_handle_these_obsticles/",NA,"",NA,"Discussion","",0,0

I just finished poring over Request Network’s White Paper dated October 25, 2017.  Here are my concerns.  Feel free to allay them with information you may know that I don’t.

On page 17 of the White Paper, Request Network promises that by the end of 2017 it will “[r]elease technical papers about architecture, upgrades and accounting implementation.”  This never happened.

Similarly, Request Network’s [website](https://request.network/#) promises that by the end of 2017 there will be the “[r]elease of the technical papers discussing architecture, upgrades, and accounting implementation details.”  This never happened either.

On page 19 of the same White Paper, Request Network promises, “We will soon release a Yellow Paper detailing the technical specifications.”  This has not happened either.  Note, that this is not a reference to the Smart Audits Yellow Paper on Request Network’s website because (a) the Yellow Paper predates the October 25, 2017, White Paper (as evidenced by the fact that the White Paper cites to the pre-existing Yellow Paper at p 12, n 12), and (b) the pre-existing Yellow Paper does not “detail[] the technical specifications” of REQ’s architecture.

Then there’s the team.  Two members of the management, CFO Christophe Lassuyt and “CMO Hipster” Julien Devoir, “believe[] that working and traveling at the same time is highly effective,"" which may explain the utter failure to “[r]elease technical papers about architecture, upgrades and accounting implementation"" on time.  Moreover, most of their team are self-styled “enthusiasts” unlike the formidable MIT educated teams behind other coins.

Thus far, all that Request Network has produced are papers outlining generalized, broad concepts.  Something anyone of us could do.

First it seems as if Request is not a 3rd party, on page 4 of the whitepaper says:

""it is necessary either to share banking information, or to use a third party that is common to both entities (Paypal, Venmo, Lydia , Stripe ...).""

How is REQ not considered at 3rd party too?


Next I see it says that security is a  plus of REQ, ""Security, since it is not necessary to share banking information""

How do you not share any banking information with REQ? I don't see how REQ is more secure than PayPal or Venmo in this case.


The big use case of REQ in my eyes is being able to accept many different currencies.

If someone finds value in this and wants to post it there due to my reddit age that’d be cool. 

Req will increase in value due to demand increasing by token burns. This will happen when Req breaks in to the commercial invoicing industry which see’s 5 trillion dollars a day in payments. Req will be burned as a portion of fee up to .5% at first until the value of Req increases and fee’s will be adjusted accordingly.  You may ask why would a company use Req as opposed to whatever they use now. There are a ton of reasons but I will point out some major ones. The first and obvious is due to the direct cost savings compared to current providers. cost savings and speed will help initially gain attention. More in depth using Req as invoicing a company can create “smart extensions”. Meaning every payment request they send out, once received that payment can be allocated multiple outlets, like taxes or wherever it needs to go. The first benefit of this is the implications this has on Accounting costs and accuracy. The transaction details are stored on the chain accurately and takes away the need for dual entry accounting that is currently in use. Currently it costs 5-15$ per invoice to “account for” which costs companies a ton of money. On top of the cost manual entry causes error as well. This leads in to the need for companies to pay millions in audit fee’s as well. For example Bank of America paid 100 million in audit fee’s for one year. If even a portion of that is automated then that’s quite a huge benefit for companies to use request.  The smart extensions are completely customizable in order for any company or government agency to adhere to whatever laws they are governed by.  This makes request a truly global network that any company any size can use. So while a portion of a small percentage to be burned may seem like a small amount when you are talking about a 5 trillion a day market that will be hugely beneficial for req holders. This will be where Req makes it big. In addition to the “pay with req” that will increasingly drive demand there are many factors at play when determining the future token value. Companies more than anyone are willing to alter current practices in order to save money and make things simpler and req will offer that on a global scale.  I hope this helped some people understand the value and by no means am I part of the company so if I missed anything let me know!!

We don’t need tweets from them shilling the coin. 

Our contract as investors is to get provided with a bi-weekly update and that’s all what we ask for.  And to be honest they’ve been doing amazing so far. 

I’m ready to do some shopping with my Tokens!

It is apparently based off of an EU directive meaning it will soon be the rule across the EU.

Now, we all know how aggressive businesses and institutions are when it comes to revenue retention and boosting profits so surely they will not just take the hit on this. Could Request be the solution that makes everybody a winner in this case? As it's EU-wide it could lead to a huge increase in adoption in one of the most valuable markets in the world.

My first post on here so would like to hear any other thoughts on this? The source seems a little odd to me or maybe I'm looking into it a little to much.

understand everyone is excited about Request, it’s obviously one of the best crypto-projects ever thought.

However, there’s a lot of newcomers (welcome btw) and it seems that a lot of you got in because of the price perspective. It’s normal,  nobody wants to lose money.

Yet, Request’s team had been very clear about its roadmap. It’s a long term game. Yes, they always deliver but it doesn’t mean that sometimes, an issue could happen or that the biweekly updates could be just... a regular update without major annoucement.

This market is going crazy and everyone is looking for news. The team will not work to give us news, they’ll just work to build the project. Sometimes, there will be no huge annoucements.

Even though I like the excitement, I’d also like that we all give them the time and our patience. 

Personally, I don’t care about lambos, I like tech and would be glad if it could build me a nicer life. That’s why I stayed away from something like Verge, that’s why I will stick with Req for a long time.

But please, those current prices discussions are non-sense : REQ will be way more valuable in a few months or years. Buy, hold it and enjoy. And if, one day, the market goes down, trust the team. If you’re here, I hope it’s for them, not only for your future car.",NA,"7nsdgs",NA,0,NA,"false",1518488479,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","false","linkflairlabel","","false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/7nsdgs/bought_between_004005_and_i_really_dont_care/",NA,"",NA,"Discussion","",0,1

For a few months now, I have been following REQ and I am a huge fan of the project  and the great work the developers have done so far. I believe in this concept with all my heart, but I do have a concern. There are a lot of posts stating that Request Network will one day replace paypall and other billion dollar corporations. How does the team protect the project from these corporations or maybe other parties? When they see their chance, these would have way more manpower and funds to achieve the same goal and could use the coding and the ideas made so far to start their own similar project. I believe that a team much bigger than the 7 people of req can still easily out-achieve a small development team in terms of time, business-network, funding and  combined competence. Are there any legal restrictions against doing this?

An argument I’ve seen before for companies to not go into this business is that it may not be profitable for companies to compete with REQ, because the only money the REQ team will make from now on is just appreciation of the currency. Where a firm would still need profits, making the costs of their service higher than just the networking costs of REQ. This can easily be dismantled by the fact that a company can still make profit, by just getting a huge return on their initial investment. Thus giving them the same incentive to make a good working product as our beloved team has. Let me know what you guys think.

Keep HODL’ing

The more responses, the more accurate the survey.

I've been dabbling in crypto for a couple months now and it's really just been more of a hobby and because of that I've done research to understand the technology but no so much the market. As I've been getting more serious about it one thing I am having a hard time wrapping my head around is how the relationship between REQ and ETH functions on an exchange like Binance. I know this is more of a general crypto market question and maybe doesn't belong here but REQ is my main coin so I was hoping to get advice or knowledge from those in this community.

I know that there are other relationships like REQ and BTC but for this question I would like to just use ETH as an example. I understand that REQ has a market price that is in units of ETH and that the relationship between that and the market price of ETH is how the FIAT price of a REQ token is calculated. My current understanding of the relationship is that if the price of ETH were to rise then the market price of REQ would drop because ETH now holds more value. And of course vice versa. This is also assuming that the REQ market was static and only ETH was changing. Is this the correct relationship between the two?

The reason I am trying to understand this relationship is because I can't wrap my head around how to accurately place a limit trade since both of the markets are volatile. Is there a general rule of thumb you should use when placing a limit or does it really just come down to really understanding the markets?

If any of my understandings are incorrect please let me know. I like to think I have a pretty good understanding of the technology but now I am trying to better understand the market as a whole.

I'm a new REQ investor and this is my first Reddit post! :)

I think this project has great potential, the only issue that I see with RN is in respect to transaction speed/time in the payment process: how will RN take care of the time it takes for a transaction to be completed if it is based on the Ethereum Blockchain?

If an ETH transaction can sometimes take up to several minutes and requires 'n' number of confirmations, how is this not to affect RN payments?

For example: why did RN not choose to use Raiblocks instead of Ethereum?

Is there a method to keep reputation a non-biased judgement made by the architecture, rather than the participants?

If users are given that power, I see the potential for manipulation and bias to negatively influence scoring of reputation.  Groupthink can be a problem at times, as much as consensus is valuable.  A great example of this is the mass social attacks often made on twitter.

I just want to clear something up because it seems to be an ongoing source of distress in the community and a good source of FUD for people who want to find potential issues with the project (it's good to be skeptical)  
&amp;nbsp;      




The team currently has 3 devs:    

Vincent Rolland (Lead Engineer)    
   
Elliott Denis (Full Stack Engineer)    

Etienne Tatur (CTO)    
    




You will have seen most of the Github contribution from Vincent and Elliott as Etienne being CTO obviously requires his efforts to be placed elsewhere.  
&amp;nbsp;           
**Now**, I feel like people are overlooking a key aspect of the Request Ecosystem. The fact that it's designed to be an Ecosystem. In one of the most recent [updates](https://blog.request.network/request-network-project-update-december-22nd-2017-first-feedbacks-colossus-introducing-request-51fc3387a686) they introduced Request Hub, the whole purpose of Request Hub is to help decentralise Request by building the community outwards and encourage third parties to build on top of Request.  
&amp;nbsp;         
If you take a look at the [mindmap](https://www.mindmeister.com/995302918?t=Y78CuCvpRn) you will see that there are plenty of ways to contribute and there will be very reasonable incentives to actually build projects on top of Request.  
&amp;nbsp;      
 
  
In case it's not clear, building on top of Request can be profitable in two ways:  
&amp;nbsp;    



  
* You can receive funding from the Request foundation from your project, so it's not like the work you're putting in is for nothing.   
&amp;nbsp;   



  
* Once you've created an extension, you will receive a cut of the fees for people using that extension when transacting with Request. This means that if Request gains mainstream acceptance and your extension is useful - you could have some very good passive income.  
&amp;nbsp;        



  
It might seem a bit like this is the Request team being lazy, but this has always been the intention and will truly create a decentralised ecosystem and allow people to build whatever they see a use for, this also means there will be NO single point of failure like there are with other projects. Obviously at this current point in time, if the Request team disappeared, we'd have an issue. But a year down the line, when the major goals have been achieved - the project could live on just fine without the core team.  
&amp;nbsp;    

  
If you want to take a look at the kind of extensions you build, take a look at this [mindmap](https://www.mindmeister.com/991002501?t=R1iofDilV0) obviously plenty of these will be handled directly by the core dev team as they require things such as partnerships, or some pretty complex work - but there are so many options for Request that it'd be quite easy to pick one of these aspects and contribute.

So I transferred the minimum amount of REQ from Binance exchange which as of the time of writing is 30 REQ. 20.1 REQ was used for transfer fees (I checked, if I transferred my whole balance, it would also charge 20.1 REQ). After a few minutes, I loaded tokens in MEW and saw 9.9 REQ but zero ETH balance (might be decimal places?). In any case, I access the wallet via MetaMask and I see 0 ETH there too. Now this is the first time I'm trying this transfer, and say I would like to send those 9.9 REQs to another wallet, what can I do? Meta Mask only sends ETH I guess? Any help or links I can read so I know how to move some REQ around?

I could use current escrow payment options, but this might be a huge pain in the ass to set up. My concern is having access to $ funds in an escrow account, and not knowing when to release the funds as I would not have immediate access to when the products have been shipped.

However, this seems like an opportunity to use a smart contract (if a tracking number exists for that transaction, then release payment to the seller). Sounds simple enough.

I know you guys are super busy now but I wanted to make a suggestion that maybe you could keep in mind for future implementation. 

I have been using Intuit Quickbooks for as far as I can remember for my business. I’m sure you know of it, but for those who don’t, it’s an accounting software. What would be amazing and a great use case is if the Request portal was implemented into the software and we could send out invoices for crypto/fiat payments! I wonder how open Intuit would be to this partnership? 

Anyway, this is definitely something to consider for the future but the first mover advantage could be important here.

I'm trying to seriously understand the potential of Request. Talking of 'Request replacing Paypal at Amazon': 

1. how do the fees look like when Amazon wants to get paid in USD and the customer wants to pay in USD? How is that different from PayPal and can the payment fee be significantly lower, as the credit card has to be charged (like paypal does)? 

2. who buys the tokens? Amazon to lower their payment processing costs or the customer?

I'm just thinking: as all cryptocurrencies are being so awful volatile, they are still mostly used as investment/gambling and not yet as real currency (who get's paid and does his groceries in Bitcoin that changes every minute?). So in order for Request to really work for online shops for example, it first needs a widely accepted cryptocurrency that the people would use, otherwise they will continue using Dollar for that matter. But then: what is really the point of tokens and is there anything that makes paypal harder to follow Request and accept the cryptocurrencies as well?

Companies like Microsoft, Valve, etc. want to accept crypto but don't actually want to handle it due to volatility and high fees.  Even the quick, low fee currencies are still going to have massive price volatility due to the nature of crypto (not to mention the difficulty gaining the name recognition of Bitcoin).

And this is an issue with them accepting one currency.  Try hundreds.  Or try being the mom and pop store that wants to accept crypto and runs into the same issues without the resources of a Microsoft to solve it.  It's a big pain to the point where they don't want to do it.

Or... they can use Request... and get paid in the fiat they want to hold while gaining the capability to accept hundreds of coins for minimal fees all via a single Pay via Request button.  With REQ, accepting crypto goes from being a complex pain to being extraordinarily simple.

It's a grand vision but it's one that I feel is absolutely essential if crypto is ever going to enter the mainstream.  Adoption of cryptocurrency is terrible right now but REQ can help change that.

Answer from Request devs in an AMA last year when they were asked about POS:


A:
Yes! It is one of the opinions in the future. It's in the whitepaper and it was answered in the AMA in November.

Can you stake on the Request Network?

Short answer: Not yet. It is all dependent on the development of technology on the Ethereum Network, Plasma and Sharding in particular. Developers are open to staking and this coupled with burning tokens makes Request Network a must hold investment.

Long answer: The developers’ comments are that they are keeping their options open, so essentially, we don’t know yet. The developers have set up a burning mechanism to help scale the project. As tokens are burned for every transaction over time the value of the token is increased.

It should be noted though that the Request Network is open to the concept of staking and would readily implement depending on the new technologies being introduced to the Ethereum network, for further reading look into Plasma and Sharding on the Ethereum Network.

How this will all play out is still vague until further developments on the Ethereum network are made. There could even be the possibility that Request will fork from the Ethereum network and use staking to secure the network. With the burning mechanism (Gateways) and staking (PoS) working hand in hand Request could cater to both developers who create Gateways and lay investors who want to create a form of passive income for holding tokens.",NA,"7p2w6i",NA,0,NA,"false",1518511810,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","false","linkflairlabel","","false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/7p2w6i/reminder_of_possible_passive_earnings_from_request/",NA,"",NA,"Info","",0,0

I think it's fairly easy to notice that lately a lot of the posts reaching the top of r/crypto in relation to REQ have been suffering from the mods sorting the top displayed comments to ""controversial"". This brings the most contentious and often FUD-filled dickish comments to the top, while suppressing those which actually have popular support. This was a key factor in a lot of the FUD surrounding the bi-weekly release as far as I can tell. I have not seen this issue occur with VeChain at any point recently, since the mods seem to adore that project. What can we do about this?

They all hate auditors. What do all publicly traded company's hate more than auditors? The bill.","Stumbled across this project last week and as an auditor, it naturally peaked my interest. 

I read through RequestNetwork's yellowpaper that dives into the concept of ""Smart Audits"" today. If this project achieves their goals the industry will never be the same.

On most audits Revenue, Accounts Receivable, and Expenses are three of the most tedious areas for both the auditors and the Company being audited. This is due to the necessity to inspect a purchase order, invoice, terms of sale, evidence of cash receipt/payment, and a journal entry for what can easily be upwards of 300 transactions for more complex companies. The client has to expend their own resources to gather the supporting documents and then the auditor has to comb through the details matching up all the pertinent info to address the audit assertions. When it's all said and done it's hundreds of hours of audit work. RequestNetwork's platform can easily cut these hours down by 50% on the low end by compiling all of this information in one place while adding the extra assurance that comes with blockchain transactions. 

That's really only the tip of the iceberg. They're looking to address a lot of issues that commonly come up in audits and can reduce audit fees dramatically.

I'll be keeping my eye on this project over the next few years and I would love to see all this come to fruition.

C'mon y'all! Today is in fact super bullish for us! Read on--

1) Kyber (REQ's liquidity provider) announced a giant partnership with ICX, the Korean behemoth. Why is this a big deal? This is a partnership across chains! Kyber will help facilitate liquidity across the ETH chain and the ICX chain. This means all the ICX tokens, and our brothers in Korea will be able to use the ""Pay with Request"" button with their local tokens.
Source: https://blog.kyber.network/new-strategic-partnership-announcement-kyber-network-icon-78bd0f572820

2) REQ announced in its biweekly update that it will set aside 30 MILLION USD (most of the ICO funds!) for development on top of the REQ protocol! I come from the Antshares/NEO days and if you're familiar with City of Zion (CoZ)--the dev community that built out things like the NEON wallet, you'll know why this is a big deal. REQ is creating incentives for people to form a REQ-CoZ. This means REQ's main devs can focus on the protocol level, while independent devs (like me) can work on various apps/websites/buttons/widgets/plugins that work with REQ. Someone can build an ICO framework, someone can build a charity donation framework, you get the idea!
Source: https://blog.request.network/request-network-project-update-january-19th-2018-announcing-a-30-million-request-fund-6a6f87d27d43

3) REQ has revealed its forward-thinking approach by mentioning their VR/AR research. Like Wayne Gretzky, the great ice hockey player said, the legends don't follow the puck, they go to where the puck is going to be. REQ is thinking about VR/AI/QR-code payments, not just replacing Paypal. Imagine automated cars or robots having to make thousands of payments per second--they can't pay THREE percent on each txn. REQ will step in and make this seamless for them. Btw, they had envisioned this in the whitepaper itself...good to see them researching it actively now!
Source: https://blog.request.network/request-network-project-update-january-19th-2018-announcing-a-30-million-request-fund-6a6f87d27d43

4) Hiring and expanding the team: REQ has been criticized for having a small (but very competent and lean) team, well those FUDsters can now find a dumpster because REQ will have its own CoZ (see 30 million fund above) and also expand the team.
Source: https://blog.request.network/request-network-project-update-january-19th-2018-announcing-a-30-million-request-fund-6a6f87d27d43

5) Finally, some fuzzy mushy stuff. The community here has grown so much, and is growing rapidly (one of the fastest growing crypto subs)! I remember being among the first subscribers, and in the dark days when we were below ICO we comforted each other about the promise of this project and bought every dip together. Good to see that spirit continue ;)
Also mushy and cute is this picture of the REQ team with the Kyber team taking their meals together. Why does this matter? Shows that it isn't just a partnership in name, and on paper. REQ team moved to Singapore to be with Kyber--great to see them gelling well.

REQ has always been about the long-term. And the long-term fundamentals have never looked better--we have healthy partnerships, a real vision for the future, and we are delivering!

During the crash being invested 60% in REQ I wasnt worried at all about how low it went cause I knew/know it will bounce back to ~$1 again.  I already did a Sortof ""make and move"" when I began crypto cause I bought 12-18 coins off the bat throwing in ~$20 into alot of coins and then when they exploded I'd move profits into REQ and buy another coin consistently.  At that point I was just trading crypto now I'm investing and I'm very excited to see what REQ can become this year we haven't even hit $1 billion market cap yet and somehow coins like Tron have over $10 billion.

(See Link for more info) I’ve been holding REQ for a while now and today’s update show the potential of REQ yet again - always under the premise of crypto being widely accepted over the course of the next years.

Now to my point. I’m sure one can think of Mark Cuban in a controversial way, but he’s become an advocate of crypto over the past months. As the owner of the Mavs and operator of a stadium he has lots of use cases to explore payment options (and accounting needs) with crypto. When I saw the news I obviously thought why only Bitcoin and Ether? REQ could potentially offer so much more over time.

Cuban owns business units with developers and invested into Blockchain companies. Why not use some of the 30 million incentive announced this morning to get him and his team working on an integration for their applications? 

Could a partnership between Mark Cuban and REQ potentially result in some sort of flagship project? As a community we could possibly make him aware of REQ by tweeting him, emailing the Dallas Mavericks etc. I’m not trying to force anything of course and at the end of the day it’s out of our control anyways. However, I could see this as real world application driving attention to REQ, testing REQ and help creating a proof of concept - which by all euphoria still needs to be created. It may help result into adoption of REQ some day.

Imagine the Mavs starting to accept crypto for tickets powered by REQ. If that goes well they start testing buying a Hotdog with crypto inside the Stadium. If that goes well parking tickets around the stadium could be powered by REQ...

All we can do is make Cuban aware of REQ. From there it’s out of our control, but I could see this as a interesting opportunity for a real world project.

What do you think? Would it be worth a try making a connection between Cuban and REQ?


Here’s an article of Cuban mentioning to accept crypto for tickets.

If you are like me and don't use Telegram or Slack I invite you to join the unofficial Discord server for Request. The server is still very much WIP and I am very welcome for suggestions (especially emoji ideas).

##Why Discord?

Unlike Telegram it offers the ability to create multiple voice and text channels, easier permission management, easy custom emojis and no limit on backlog (like Slack has). I encourage everyone to check it out.

##Who tf are you?

I started an unofficial Discord server for NavCoin before where the idea was later adopted and the devs made an official server with now over 2500 members. I hope to reach this point here as well eventually as I feel like Discord is the perfect tool for Cryptocurrency communities. If you have experience with online community management you can contact me here or on Discord to become a mod (especially if you're from the US).

&gt;Crypto-currencies VAT/Tax payments

Can someone please explain to me what exactly they will be doing themselves, or what they have been doing for the past years?   Apart from the re-branding.

REQ is already plugged in to Y Combinator.  YC has funded 1,430 companies since 2005 which is about 3,500 founders.  There were 124 teams in their 2017 group. I’d bet over the next 2-3 years YC will have funded 500+ more.

If REQ’s mission is to “build an ecosystem for dapps that improve financial flows” (_this =/= PayPal 2.0, moonkids_) then they don’t have to look very far in order to find great teams to build those Dapps. Those great teams are already in YC.

A lot of YC startups focus on financial flows, so I’m convinced many will submit to the REQ fund.  I like this, because it would mean then that those teams submitting would have _already been vetted by the best startup incubator in the world_.  

So, essentially, those teams would be vetted twice (once by YC, once by REQ).  My feeling is that a team like that will build the killer Dapp we’ve all been waiting for. And it will be on top of Request.


## $20-$100k is more than enough for the right entrepreneurs

People need to realize that amazing companies don’t need much to start. YC’s standard funding amount is $120k for a 7% stake.  Unicorns such as Reddit, Airbnb, and Stripe all started from that funding.

You can’t just throw a million dollars at a problem and expect it be solved quickly. In my opinion, Startups are supposed to be _bootstrapped._

For example, Airbnb funded themselves  in the early days by maxing out $20k in credit cards and selling a joke “Obama-O’s” cereal they created to pay the credit cards off. They’re now a $50billion company. 

The startups that solve the real problems are the ones who claw back and fund themselves creatively. Those who get $1m+ in funding before they have any traction often have too big of egos to actually get anything done.

Thanks for reading.  Long term holder here and excited for REQ’s future.

The number of dapp's built on top of the platform is in the 1000's. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now I know a lot of you are wondering, **""What does Ethereum have to do with Request?!?!?!"".**

&amp;nbsp;

Simply put, both Request and Ethereum are platforms. **I know there was some concern about the Request Fund, but rest assured, this will allow the Request platform to scale rapidly.**

&amp;nbsp;

Imagine if Vitalik and his team were building all of these dapp's on their own? They would never be able to leave the office/house and on top of that they would only be able to complete a small fraction of usuable/useful dapps in the same amount of time 3rd party dev's can build their own.

&amp;nbsp;

**Request is aiming to be the 'Ethereum' of Fintech Dapps.** I am unaware of any platform at the moment that is trying to accomplish this, so there isn't much competition I'm aware of. And on top of this, the Request Core team will most likely continue to work on the deliverables they mentioned in the whitepaper. **So it's a win-win.**

&amp;nbsp;

**The name of the game is being able to scale rapidly and efficiently. It doesn't matter how many devs the Request team hires, they won't be able to rapidly build and deploy every single dapp Imaginable in their ecosystem without the Request Hub.** I'm almost enticed to build something myself now, knowing there will be financial incentive to do so :).

The team’s primary focus is building out the core protocol and accomplishing everything on their roadmap. The Request Hub was always planned from the very beginning and is clearly defined in the roadmap on page 7 (link below). The Hub is a way to expand the scope of the project and allow a true ecosystem to be developed. If you think about projects like Wordpress and/or Ethereum, they have a huge ecosystem composed of developers who are developing on top of the core. Request is doing something  similar here with the Hub and is even paying to help incentivize community development.

What is ZkSnarks ? I fail to gather simple informations about it. Is it a Ethereum feature ? Is it a specificity of RequestNetwork ? Is it out yet ? Is it a concept in development ?



EDIT : so apparently ZkSnarks allow us to verify some computation without knowing anything about it.

It mean that the Ethereum blockchain do not need to make the computation 1+1 in order to prove indisputably that this is indeed equal to 2. This allow the Ethereum blockchain to scale better, as we have the proof that the answer is 2 without having to do the computation. We prove that a statement is true (mysterious computation == 2), without revealing why is it true (1+1=2). The best part of this is that the only public thing here is the proof that the answer is 2. The computation of the data is private as it is not on the blockchain. 

[Introduction to SNARKs by Ethereum Foundation conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr95o_k_SwI)

EDIT II : For now it is implemented on the Ethereum blockchain [since October 17](https://blog.ethereum.org/2017/10/12/byzantium-hf-announcement/) with limitation in what kind of computation it is able to proove without knowledge. ""Elliptic curve addition and scalar multiplication on alt_bn128 (EIP 196) and pairing checks (EIP 197), permitting ZK-Snarks and other cryptographic mathemagic™"". A private tx [have been made](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-upgrade-byzantium-is-live-verifies-first-zk-snark-proof), it ""indicates that the potential for zero-knowledge proofs is real."".

Bank of America is somewhat seeing a threat to their business model.  [Read Article on BoA here.](https://www.ccn.com/bank-of-america-admits-cryptocurrencies-are-a-threat-to-its-business-model) 

My personal note: I frequently place transactions through my US based business to Germany and China. Bank of America kindly charges me 45$ per transaction, which is ridiculous. For my personal account I transfer money to Germany and to the US as well. So I  recently started using ETH or BCH to make the transaction. I buy on Bitstamp, transfer to Coinbase, sell the coin for fiat and transfer USD or EUR to my bank account. Fees are minimal and the whole process takes me 20-25min. Volatility in that short time frame is a pain, but I’ve managed to have it at a minimum. I’ve seen XRP move a lot faster, but it’s not on Coinbase.

I would do the same for my business account, but it would become complicated from a accounting perspective.

In other words I can not wait for REQ working and for me to bypass these horrendous fees of Bank of America. So yes, their business model is in jeopardy.

By creating utility tokens, many of these ICO's can sell these tokens for the service it is developing - an example of this is Filecoin, they raised hundreds of millions $$ by selling tokens that will provide users with access to its decentralized cloud storage platform.

Enter Request Network

If ICOs use Request Network, they would provide a secure and safe way to raise funds without the need of even providing an ETH/BTC address that could be changed/hacked. They would simply get people to donate to their Request ID or have a Request portal already set up on their website.

It gets better though - using Request Network, you'll be able to contribute to the ICO with any kind of cryptocurrency you have. You'll be able to do this straight from your ledger or private wallet without the need to convert on exchanges. This opens up so much more capital for ICOs whilst also benefitting those wanting to participate. The best thing is that it will convert your cryptocurrency to the currency of choice for those raising the money.

Eg - You want to participate in an ICO that would traditionally only accept ETH. You would have had to sell your shitcoins, buy ETH and then send it to an address that could be compromised. Well using Request the process would be - You see an ICO you want to participate in, you have your shitcoins stored safely in your ledger, you simply transact through the ICO Request Network protocol on their website, without the need to verify a huge long ETH address, and you simply send them your shitcoins which automatically converts to ETH/BTC/Fiat for the ICO wanting to raise cash. Trust/verification systems could be set up within the protocol to ensure you aren't sending to a hackers  address. 

REQ is more than a payment gateway for businesses, it could revolutionise fundraising in the cryptocurrency space. Something that is vitally needed if you know anything about the dodgy ICOs that have gone on recently.

Request solves actual problems within and out with the crypto space, the devs are competent as seen by the latest update, there's an incentive to hold the coins due to token burning, it's truly decentralised, teams are lining up to build on top of it &amp; partnerships beginning to roll in. 

Request is shaping up to be a very nice hold for 2018. ",NA,"7usr9o",NA,0,NA,"false",1520476960,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","false","linkflairlabel","","false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/7usr9o/request_network_the_future_of_ico_fundraising/",NA,"",NA,"Use Case","",0,1

Hey guys. 

Having an issue here. I withdrew tokens from Kucoin and sent them to my ledger nano S using the ETH wallet. On the exchange it said success, on the blockchain it said success but nothing is showing up.

I deleted the ETH app, I reset the nano S, I spoke to kucoin customer support and sent an email to the help desk at ledger...and still nothing. Showing a 0 balance and it is not showing the transaction on my ledger. 

What else can I do? Im lost as fuck and waiting to hear back from the ledger team but is there someone else who can help here? I cant be the only one who has this issue. 

I have seen that some people were waiting like 24-36+ hours to get their coins to show up but is there a way to be sure that all I need to do is wait? 

Every other App is working fine except this. Thanks guys. No, my dumbass didnt do a test first which is my fault but yea. As you can see its saying it should be there but not seeing on my ledger.

If you haven't read the whitepaper (especially if you've already invested) I highly recommend doing so. I hear a lot of talk about REQ strictly in terms of ""PAYPAL 2.0"" but there's more to it than just that. Here's a short summary of two other things REQ is aiming to accomplish:

- Automatic fiat conversions: REQ is aiming to not only do fiat online payments, but give users the ability to pay people in any fiat currency and have it converted automatically. For instance, if someone in Sweden wanted to pay someone in the U.S. who only accepted dollars, REQ could accept Swedish kronor from the sender and convert it to dollars for the receiver automatically. Same thing goes for crypto as well, users will be able to automatically convert cryptos to other cryptos or crypto to fiat and vice versa. If REQ comes through on this goal the implications could be enormous.

- Automated accounting: Though seemingly not as exciting as the automatic fiat/crypto conversion, this one is just as big if you ask me. Accounting is a multi trillion dollar industry and with automated accounting REQ has the potential to save companies a ton of money on taxes. Using REQ could reduce or potentially eliminate the need for companies to hire an accountant which is a huge incentive to use it as a payment provider. I'm not aware of any other cryptos trying to tackle accounting at the moment so if REQ succeeds in this regard it will have first mover's advantage and potentially be in a league of its own. 


Once again, I highly recommend reading the white paper.  Any of us here on the forum can tell you about REQ but the best way to learn is to just read for yourself. That was just a brief summary so to anyone who feels like I missed important details or other REQ goals, feel free to leave a comment about it.

The solidity and the actual real world use cases of our product.

Remember we are all investors , even if one of us owns 1 Req he/she still qualifies as an investor.

Why? Because we all speculate based on facts and material about how solid this project is going to be.

Same situation but you want to go from ETH to REQ (or any other altcoin) when you make the transfer, under new tax law that seems to be a taxable event. You could swap ETH for REQ but it automatically sends USD to your taxes account.

I'm doing a 24 hour hackathon next weekend and was seriously thinking about trying to incorporate the javascript library into it. I was hoping I could get some cool ideas from the community of possible ways to implement the library into our project. 

Here is the project statement: 
Create a solution that puts humans at the center of
your design to help them live safer and more secure lives. While we want you to come up with a
creative solution, we are looking to award the team that demonstrates the most attention given to its
user base. Bonus points will be awarded for good development practices and/or best use of the
API (use of our API is not required. You may leverage our Shine API, which incorporates
Liberty Mutual data, insurance core competencies, and city infrastructure data to help
customers live a life without worry. Featured services include Total Home Score, Vehicle
Thefts, Vehicle Stats, and Parking Rules. https://developers.solarialabs.com

If anyone has any cool ideas they would be greatly appreciated! Keep in mind that this is just a 24 hour event so the projects can't be too complex.

Paypal served a fundamnetal bridge between hving to enter my card and address details every time I made a purchase versus once in an account and then completing payment in a few clicks.

Yes Paypal does a huge amount more, but not for 99% of the consumers using it (let's ignore its obvious shortcoming to a commerce business - this is a balance that will certainly swing and egalise itself with any blockchain solution).

So for REQ to get into the public accpetance which is of course the number one goal on the road to where they want to be, they have to offer something new to the every day user. 'Pay with REQ' simply does not do that. 
Yes I understand that awesome things can be done with the data and the way it is handled on the blockchain ...but does Mr Joe Average consumer, no ...so far the road to mass adoption is rocking.

As for ""Add management of Fiat-currencies to Request"" - that is as detailed as the whitepaper is concerning this, and for good reason ...just look at FairX, Coinbase and any other cypto company that has or is planning to include Fiat functionality ...the regulatory road and scope for error and consequence is a big issue. We as a society still seem to think it is ok to f**k up with crypto ..oops, we lost 170$million ...people will forget about it in a month ...but Fiat, we are less forgiving and hence much more regulated.

I am now at Q3 2018 ...and I can pay with my button and in a best case scenario for me the everyday Joe, get funds directly from my bank into a nice wallet UI or even better, directly on pull request (because I am not going to keep my salary in crypto every month if I only need to seond a bit of it via Request). 

What has been done that makes me want to educate my 70 year old mother that it is time she ditched PayPal and moved to Request ...not enough, however she keeps asking me about this 'Nano' payment button she has seen in a few of her favourite shops (I didn't say it was better, just said she had SEEN it) - I explain to her she is not ready for that yet :D ....and she asks me about Stellar and how they are targetting the unbankable (real measurable human impact has a great effect on other humans) ....but none of this gets her on REQ and there is nothing specific other than accounting functionality which only works as intended with mass adoption ....to get her and others to mass adopt (ironically she was an accountant - a hard bunch to make change anything, they are very set in their ways and can't always afford to early adopt, preferring always tried and tested solutions).

So, ...why did I invest in REQ, ...at the time it was a great solution and made up the part of my portfolio that consisted of financial solutions and early adoption simple crypto ideas ....but as time moves on it is clear that the winner in this battle will be he who merges Fiat with cypto in a way that betters the system we use on Paypal or Stripe, in a way that my mother can understand and see a clear benefit to. ....this will be reliant on a small yet innovsative idea, and mass market adoption ...not a solid tech team and a roadmap that meets linear opbjectives. ...I feel thsat REQ is no longer unique in this space.

Finally ...I feel the openess of REQ whilst ideologically fantastic, will also hinder its corporate adoption ...unsurpringly.

Did I make a profit, ...well, I didn't lose anything, but I still drive a KIA and my feet are firmly on planet earth ....but this post is not about profit, it is about the critical thinking required to back those who I think will stay the test of time.

Disclosure: I am a developer or web and ecommerce systems so I have a double sided view to payment systems from a consumer and retailing persepctive. 
I no longer hold REQ and removed it from my Delta app watchlist (make your choices in life and move on, don't beat yourself up daily about them).
This is FUD, ...because of course that is the current buzz word for any negative opinion in this industry ...but it is my own personal FUD and it's justifications, you should be responsible for your own choices.",NA,"7xxy5z",NA,0,NA,"false",1520546573,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/7xxy5z/why_i_am_out_of_here_req_but_wish_you_all_the_best/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

I am aiming to build a mockup p2p marketplace which uses Request for the p2p payment layer. 
This marketplace will also store metadata for each sale on the Ethereum blockchain.

This means every time an item is bought, the buyer would pay for both the item and the cost of either deploying or updating a contract on the Ethereum network.

Centralized exchanges have been a huge point of failure and will be in the future. If you don't control the private keys, you don't own the coins.

For Request Network you can create a paper wallet at https://www.myetherwallet.com/

Alternatively if you have more than 1 months pay (or $1000 if you're a student) in Req/cryptocurrency, I recommend getting a hardware wallet. ONLY buy from authorized retailers.

Ledger wallet retailers: https://www.ledgerwallet.com/retailers Trezor wallet retailers: https://trezor.io/resellers/

Edit: yes you are free to keep your coins on an exchange if you like, you can take my recommendations or dont. And yes using hardware/paper wallets have vulnerabilities, specifically if you store your private keys in your email or computer where it can get hacked. or if you fall for a phishing scam that takes you to a website which records your private keys or password. Or you can just lose your private key or seed words.

* ""Pay with Bank Deposit""

* ""Pay with PayPal""

* ""Pay with Request""

*""Does Request mean I can request to pay... but don't have to...? confused... just gonna use PayPal.""*

At least PayPal implies that it's some system that is your pal that helps you with paying. In contrast, ""Pay with Request"" feels somehow equivalent to ""Pay with Cash Register"" or ""Pay with EFTPOS machine"".

This was bound to happen someday (although no one could predict when). This change was not caused by major fundamental changes (i.e. China banning Bitcoin, a fact which the markets recovered quite quickly from), but by psychology. 

Request Network, the idea, the team, the community, the outside devs that are working on dapps, the 30 million bounty, the existing, planned and future partneships, none of that has changed. The project is still right on track in regards to the roadmap. The team is still delivering on time, and is expanding. There have been important uploads to the code recently. There are interesting updates in regards to Kyber soon, which will allow Request to be currency agnostic. There are metadevelopments in the world of ecommerce, which signal that the market needs cheaper payment service providers. All lights are still on green. 

Now what to do? You could do 2 things: panic and sell your REQ (probably at a loss), for no other reason than current bears on the road, or you could hodl, since no fundamentals have changed and this project will likely be quite successful (as per the points mentioned above). Stop checking the prices every 5 minutes, man up, and sit out the bad weather.

Crypto is here to stay. A lot of shitcoins and projects will not surive this crash, some currencies (with no underlying utility except for being a store of value) will die, but the good projects (including Request) will survive and become very successful.

I love what REQ is trying to do. The one thing that either wasn't explained or that I don't understand:

At some point, I need to give something access to my banking info. Say I want to send sally $200. How does that $200 get onto the REQ platform? This never seems to be covered in the white paper. Instead it's just like ""go to amazon, click ""pay"", and bam, you paid them and didn't have to give them your banking info!"". I appreciate that I don't have to give Sally my bank / card info. But something in the REQ platform has to know that info in order to take that $200 out of my bank. So how does that happen?

Not trying to spread FUD, but I have seen a lot of comments stating that it is likely that the Great Wall will be released soon, since Kyber, the partner of the Request Team, will deploy its main net on the 11th of february. However, their [blog post](https://blog.kyber.network/announcement-kyber-network-mainnet-pilot-launch-e718ef9839db) tells us that this launch will only concern a pilot version, which will only be available for ICO investors of Kyber.

Since the blog states that the fully fublic main net will be implemented in April, don’t you guys think that we certainly have to wait till then? How else can Request implement Ether and other ERC-20 tokens, without the platform to transform these into REQ in order to pay transaction fees?

*Team*  
  
The team behind the Request Network is a small one, made up of 6 core members. They have a strong history together, first forming Moneytis – a kind of online comparison site for cross border transfer services (e.g. Western Union) that is free to use and helps people sending cross border payments to minimise fees. This is similar to the way you’d compare flights, or hotels, or car hire, so they weren’t actually processing any payments themselves.  
  
This isn’t to say that Request Network is the first time the team have explored Blockchain Tech. The CTO and Co-Founder, Etienne Tatur, developed Blockchain solutions for Qobuz, a high-res music streaming service, prior to working on Moneytis, and the co-founder and CFO, Christophe Lassuyt, has mentioned working in FinTech and blockchain tech for a few years. Per the whitepaper, both were also working in Blockchain implementations within Moneytis previously. The lead engineer, Vicent Rolland, has a strong history of software development (it is not clear how much blockchain specific history he has, beyond also working on the Blockchain network project for international money transfers within Moneytis). The advisory team hails 2/3 from 1kx, a Blockchain startup fund, and Request Network (and Moneytis before it) are YCombinator backed businesses, both of which suggest that there is a strong advisory board for the team to springboard off.  

*Tech / Use  Cases*  
  
Request is a decentralized network built on top of Ethereum (Request is an ERC20 token). It allows anyone to request a payment, which the team calls a Request Invoice, where the recipient is able to pay in a secure way and all the information is stored in a decentralized authentic ledger. The idea is that the general ledger would look something like this:  
  
DATE-PAYER-PAYEE-PAYMENT AMOUNT-REASON-EXTENSIONS-VISIBILITY  
  
You will note that there is a column there labelled extensions. The idea is that the Request Network has a ‘Core Layer’ for simple ‘Requests’, and transactions of this nature require only gas to make. However, Request have ambitions beyond this, and the idea is that the team, and external developers, can build extensions into the network to offer enhanced services, such as Escrow, Tax payments, Charitable donations, continuous payment requests, etc. Extension developers will receive a small fee, which will encourage a wide range of developers to work with Request. Given the size of the team at the moment, external developers will be of significant importance to Request, and to this end Request have recently offered a $30m developer fund for individuals or teams to pitch extensions for the network.  
  
 This fund will be vital, because the team have lofty goals.  
  
The first and most obvious solution the network offers is Online Payments, e.g. rivalling a Paypal. One of the strengths of Request is that they aim to be currency agnostic. Any currency can be used, providing that an oracle can prove the transaction happened. Per the whitepaper:  
  
&gt; Lets say Alice wants to pay for her new laptop with Bitcoins. She chooses “pay with Request” option. The system takes BTC out of her account then takes care of exchanging the bitcoins into USD for the seller, using cooperating systems. All this happens with one button click.  
  
Partnerships are therefore a hugely important part of the development of Request. They already have a liquidity solution in place, via a relationship with Kyber Network – more on that below.  
  
Beyond pure payments, however, the team also see the Request Network being used for:  
  
* Invoicing: enabling real time accounting on an immutable ledger. This would allow individuals or businesses to send more complex requests, which would detail the information needed from an invoice to meet reporting regulations, and also leverage extensions to the network such as Escrow, or late fee arrangements.  
* Audit and Accounting: building on invoicing, businesses could have a form a real time accounting if all payments in and out are detailed in an immutable and easily accessible ledger. This would reduce audit fees and enhance transparency. The team have an audit/accounting yellowpaper available online, suggesting this is an extension that they will be focusing on in great detail once the ‘core’ network is up and running.  
* IoT: extensions to the network could code contracts for use in IoT, allowing, for example, instantaneous payment of an electric car for charging costs, without the need for a third party to review.  
* Transparency: budgets for governments, charities, NGOs and the like would be considerably more transparent if spending was available for review on an immutable public ledger.  
  
The fee for these extensions is expected to be 0.05%-0.5% of the transaction value, and thus will undercut most currency market options for solutions to the above goals. Naturally, these are lofty targets, and Request will need to leverage their advisors and work hard to win some big names.  
  
*Token Value*  
  
Upon launch of the mainnet, due Q1, Request tokens will be burnt for each transaction on the network. Per the whitepaper, the tokens are necessary to participate in the network, and create advance requests (via the network). The value of tokens burnt will alter with decreasing supply (so might initially be 10 REQ burnt for a request to be made, but this will go down to a fraction of a REQ as time goes on). For liquidity, Request have a working relationship with the DEx Kyber Network – and have in fact recently moved to Singapore to work alongside the Kyber Network team to ensure this relationship blossoms.  
  
In this regard, I guess I would see investing in REQ as something like investing in oil – it is the fuel that fires the network and thus will always be in demand. It will also decrease in total quantity going forwards and thus should increase in value.  
  
Normally at this stage, I would try to value the token, based on a market share or similar value. But in the case of REQ, and as I understand it, holding REQ tokens is more like holding an asset that is required to power the network (as per my example above, it seems like it is an oil, or an electricity, or a similar expendable good) and won’t be easy to value based on a feasible dividend return. What is clear, is that if Request Network can fulfil its goals, and transactions are completed on the network across a range of use cases, the value could be considerably higher than current price.  
  
*Competition*  
  
There are some obvious Competitors to Request Network. One that often jumps out is OmiseGo, which is a similarly currency agnostic payment mechanism at its core. However, the Request Network recently put out a blog post comparing the two offerings and argued that they were in fact complimentary. Request Network can use OmiseGo as an oracle for fiat currency settlements on electronic wallets, and equally OmiseGo could use the Request Network to perform decentralized payment requests, invoicing, audit or accounting. Once again, this highlights the value of Requests goals beyond simple payment transactions.  
  
Paypal is another competitor, as are any online payment service providers. The advantage that Request Network will have, that blockchain in general offers, is that solutions based on blockchain technology can really undercut current pricing structures. Companies such as Paypal, Stripe, or other payments solutions are no doubt aware of this and are looking into the technology to reduce costs themselves. This is only good for the market.  
  
*Summing Up*  
  
Request Network is an ambitious offering, from a bright team. Though they are growing the team actively, they are still smaller than some, and so it is worth keeping an eye on the developments the team makes in the coming weeks and months to ensure they remain on track. For what it is worth, the team have an ambitious roadmap, that they are yet to fail to deliver, and have in fact moved some targets forward. Some of the upcoming goals to look out for per their roadmap:  
  
Q1 2018:  
Mainnet Release and Token Burning Begins  
Ethereum and ERC20 token deployed on Network  
‘Pay with Request’ Button launched for integration with online shopping  
  
Q2:  
ZkSnarks Proof of Concept (For Private Transactions)  
FIAT Currency intergration (See 22 December blog in references for more detail on solutions)  

Q3/4:  
Escrow and Tax Extensions  
Inter-Crrency Settlements  
IoT Framework  
  

As mentioned above, the network of Developers and Partners are going to be crucial to Request Network. The team sharing office space with Kyber Network is a good sign, and the advisory board is well suited to help Request succeed. In particular, YCombinator has a vast network of companies it has helped incubate that they can introduce to Request. Not least, CoinBase. The real value in Request Network for me lies beyond the payment solution, in Audit, Acocuntancy and Transparency, where it can be a market leader. If Request continues its bright development, it could have a very strong 2018 and beyond.

So I played around a bit with the demo, just out of curiosity, and I dunno, it just seems too 'cryptoey' for the masses in my opinion. You still have to copy the bitcoin address or scan a QR Code to send a payment, lets see your Grandparents try to figure that out.

One thing I like about Request, based on the Whitepaper, is that it seems very SIMPLE. You checkout, have a request sent to you from the merchant, and just PAY. No confusing QR codes or addresses that cause confusion.

 I don't see this Coinbase feature really catching on with the masses, not only that, but there is still a 2-3 day delay to receive funds, and I'm sure the fee's from Coinbase will be super high based on CB's track record...

If after all your research , you don't see a future in REQ , just sell and move on to the next project. You have over a thousand crypto to choose from , why waste your time arguing with REQ hodlers? 

Likewise , if you wholeheartedly believe in the future of REQ , try your best to educate new comers on the potential and roadmap of REQ. As for the obvious trolls , or people that are trying to talk new comers out of investing in REQ , try your best to counter their arguments , but NEVER ENGAGE IN A FULL BLOWN ""HEY MY DICK IS BIGGER THAN YOURS"" conversation. It's counter productive to everyone in this sub. 

If you're young and you got into crypto a few years back and is now sitting on hundreds of thousands , or even millions , good for you. But there is no need to shove your cash on everyone's face just to prove that you know better , or you're somehow better than everyone else. Fact is , if you got into crypto early , you're likely to be very well off regardless of your IQ. Everyone is a genius in a bull market , I hope you realize that and don't let money expose who you really are. 

At the end of the day we are all responsible for our decisions. If you are a hodlers , keep up with the project from time to time and adjust your holdings accordingly. Blind optimism is equally deadly as baseless pessimism. 

Conversely , if you don't see the point of investing in REQ , the market is always there for you to sell your stash , there is really no need to shit talk everyone and tell them how their investment in REQ is going to zero. Everyone is either investing to be richer than they were , or investing in something they would like to see in the crypto ecosystem. I clearly cannot speak for everyone , but I don't think I will have any regrets even if REQ fails to deliver. It's my money , I share the same vision with the team , and I believe in them for executing. That is all. The rest is up to luck/destiny/life or however you'll like to call it.

No one knows what is going to happen to REQ , which is what makes this game interesting. DYOR , place your bet , and let the game unfold itself. 

Hope everyone can respect each other's decision and make this place one of the best sub for cryptocurrency like how it once was. Peace. 

Disclaimer: Haven't sold a REQ since the sub 8 cents day , and is likely to continue holding. So take anything I say with a grain of salt.

noob here, eager to learn everything.

So one of the use cases is the invoicing system. Company A pays invoice to company B overseas in different currency, incurring all sorts of banking fees.

As I understand, the Request Network solves this problem but I have a few questions.

Would a product that solves this problem for companies, need to be built in the application layer or is this something request already supports?

The price is suffering because of this, and with new competition arriving the future of REQ is looking a little less bright. I'm not saying REQ will not have a bring future. However, let's be honest - most of us invested for gains. As you can tell the price discussion thread gets a lot more attention than the other threads, and in the crypto world, marketing has a massive influence. Just look at how many of the top 50 coins have no working product.

Why doesn't the REQ team invest in marketing? There's nothing wrong with marketing and developing the main net at the same time. More people investing in the coin, more people will want to use the network when it goes live.

Pogs themselves possessed utility as they were needed to play the game but more than that they were collector's items. Pogs could be traded and players, whether rational or not, inevitably identified favorites that were ""off the table"" when it came to trading. Does anyone else feel similarly about their top cryptos (ie. you derive joy just from the pure fact of owning them)? I can't tell if this is a red flag that I'm drawing psychological parallels to a passing fad from the 90s and an investment I'm making today but I wanted to share with the community.

If money gets sent on the blockchain it can't be refunded (much like normal bank transfers at present) unless the receiving party agrees to send a refund. I believe PayPal pays the refund from their own funds and then pursues the refund themselves. 

Will Request offer a similar service? Because if they don't - then why wouldn't someone continue to use PayPal and send money as a 'gift' which excludes you from receiving automatic refunds in the case of disputes while maintaining free online transfers. 

I'd hope that if they gained enough adoption they too would offer this service. Or alternatively maybe a premium option, costing say 1.5% to protect your payment in the event of a conflict.

I read the white paper and some related articles to try to understand how the token operates in the Request ecosystem.

I understand that the burning of the tokens essentially *validates* the transaction, but other cryptos perform validations without burning. The burning will also gradually increase the price of REQ (and the fees will lower to match it, etc...) but that still doesn't seem like a good reason to me. Why force the price of REQ to increase (aside from rewarding investors)? The founder of Ethereum was quoted saying (paraphrasing) that lowering the supply over time helps stabilize value, but that doesn't make sense to me either. The most stable would be non-inflationary and non-deflationary. REQ being forcefully deflationary seems to force the change in value. If they're looking for stability, why lower supply?

Lets wait until wallet launches, I don't think now is the best time to shill. 

It's probably one of the best times to buy, but I think the volitility of the market would force too many weak hands to sell - especially because a lot of day-traderd I know trade based off change in $ value instead of ETH, which has cause caused them to sell while a coin was doing good.

If we wait until a REQ wallet launches, it can get people intergrated and more personally invested, building more long-term investors and a more stable value.

That would be a 2 billion dollar market cap. Let's say the crypto currency market cap is 1 trillion by EoY so if REQ remained constant with btc we are looking at a 2x gain or $0.60. From there we are looking at another 5x growth or 500% gains. 

Is that even possible? What would justify the coin having a 2 billion market cap?

Hi 

I'm trying to understand how Request differentiates itself. Could you please help?


I understand that Request allows people to pay/accept payments in whatever kind of currency. I also like Request's burn method and understand that Request has alot of other features that i dont totally understand yet, like automatic accounting etc. Sorry if im missing some major points, havent had time to do in depth research yet. Two comparisons i'm wondering about:


1. Atomic swaps, like those of Komodo. Why would a payment reciever choose to recieve payments through Request rather than something like an atomic swap that changes the currencies in the background?


2. Why would a payment reciever would choose to use Request rather than Stellar Cross asset payments? I searched the reddit and found some comparisons to XLM with many people saying different target markets, but as far as i can see it seems like the product could fit in Requests market too. And i'm aware that Stellar fees are almost 0, not sure if Request has larger fees from being based on Ethereum?

Thanks!


Pasted a description of Stellar Cross asset payments below:


Cross-asset payments 
Suppose you are holding sheep and want to buy something from a store that only accepts wheat. You can create a payment in Stellar that will automatically convert your sheep into wheat. It goes through the sheep/wheat orderbook and converts your sheep at the best available rate. You can also make more complicated paths of asset conversion. Imagine that the sheep/wheat orderbook has a very large spread or is nonexistent. In this case, you might get a better rate if you first trade your sheep for brick and then sell that brick for wheat. So a potential path would be 2 hops: sheep-&gt;brick-&gt;wheat. This path would take you through the sheep/brick orderbook and then the brick/wheat orderbook. These paths of asset conversion can contain up to 6 hops, but the whole payment is atomic–it will either succeed or fail. The payment sender will never be left holding an unwanted asset. This process of finding the best path of a payment is called pathfinding. Pathfinding involves looking at the current orderbooks and finding which series of conversions gives you the best rate. It is handled outside of Stellar Core by something like Horizon.

Preferred currency Because cross-asset payments are so simple with Stellar, users can keep their money in whatever asset they prefer to hold. Preferred currency creates a very flexible, open system. Imagine a world where, anytime you travel, you never have to exchange currency except at the point of sale. A world where you can choose to keep all your assets in, for example, Google stock, cashing out small amounts as you need to pay for things. Cross-asset payments make this world possible.

As you can see, REQ is forming a falling wedge on the chart. The sell-side momentum is starting to slow and it looks like the price momentum is starting to reverse as we get closer to news from the dev team. We have hit 2550 satoshi twice in the past month and bounced hard each time. If we hit it again on good news from the team, we may be looking at a breakout. This is just my viewpoint and I will not be buying until I see confirmation of a breakout.","","81c776",NA,0,NA,"false",1522241610,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","false","linkflairlabel","","false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/81c776/downtrend_coming_to_a_possible_end/","","",NA,"Price / Market","",0,0

According to latest project update, and reafirming October's news, they are working with ChainLink.

- https://fynestuff.com/why-ethereum-needs-chainlink/

I am invested on both projects, so I may be biased but both projects are top notch in their category. Partnering between them will be huge (both in a technical PoV + investment PoV).

Hope this post is useful for public awareness for people that have not yet cared about oracles and their importance to Request Network and basically all blockchain ecosystem.

https://hackernoon.com/an-open-letter-to-banks-about-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrencies-b0c7ef9b7c62

It does a pretty good job at explaining the reason and basis of why I am investing in Request Network. It is a pretty enjoyable read cause the author is very witty in getting his points across.

For those without the time for reading it here a short snippet from the article (credits to the author Peter McCormack ) :

&gt; The infrastructure is changing, merchants are bringing out Crypto solutions, and before long you will see Pay With Bitcoin as much as you see Pay With Paypal. It took time for Paypal, it was a bit of a pain to begin with, but they persevered, and now many of us just use them, why? Well, it comes down to this thing called ease of use, creating an account on every website and entering your card details is hard work. A simple login with PayPal is so much easier.

&gt;**If someone makes things easier or cheaper for us, we tend to use it.**

&gt;When we get a simple login with Crypto and if the retailers pass on the savings from your merchant fees, then things will be cheaper. Yes, it might be negligible for a cup of coffee but a TV? A Car? A house? Then once we are using them more and more we might use them for a cup of coffee too. These fees are also relevant when travelling, and lots of us travel but have to pay all these expensive fees when spending money abroad. Our Crypto accounts are borderless so these fees don’t exist.

&gt;So if we aren’t saving our money with you and we aren’t using our debit and credit cards, then why do we need you? Everything else we can buy on the open market, there is no loyalty for mortgages and loans, we’ll get them from whoever is offering the best rate, that might not even be a bank, that might be our supermarket. **We don’t care; we just want the best rates.**

Are you getting the picture?","","86t610",NA,0,NA,"false",1522350141,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","false","linkflairlabel","","false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/86t610/an_open_letter_to_banks_about_bitcoin_and/","","",NA,"Article","",0,0

Assuming sometime in the future, 1 billion requests will be created annually, with each request costing 0.01$, that amounts to 10 million dollars in token burn which would put the price of request token to the current price(10x p/e). Take 10 billion requests annually, and each token will be valued 10 times as much as now.

But I believe that there will be many many more requests being generated each year - take billions of people, salaries, shopping, dining, traveling, B2C, B2B usecases, etc.. I think this will be a monster in the future if this is executed well. I like the Request vision- I don't think Request will be payment processor like paypal/stripe etc, but can complement it and grow big even with their financial platform for audits, accounts, transparency. I hold REQ since after the ICO.. and I feel that it will take off once the adoption starts. I feel it is near. I think integration with fiat, and invoicing in blockchain will be a game changer for audit use cases and will be one of the first live usecases on blockchain. (Edit: Privacy is a big concern, some of it may be tackled though zKsnarks, but remains to be seen how much is possible). 

Edit: Just looked up some numbers on google, there are 30 billion e-invoices created annually, growing at 10-20% annually.","","84zquj",NA,0,NA,"false",1522314368,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","false","linkflairlabel","","false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/84zquj/valuing_request_tokens/","","",NA,"Discussion","",0,0

One of my biggest issue with crypto so far is the fear of sending/paying, as it seems very ""weak"" to human error. E.g I might have put in the wrong key to send to, made a typo etc.

Because of this I don't see mass adoption happening. Eg my parents would never use crypto for fear of making a transfer and accidentally losing their money.

Does REQ solve/help this?

So far my understanding of REQ is it's based around someone that wants to receive money, sends a request to a person, and the person fulfills that payment request?

So no chance of human error for the payer? Is that correct?","","84c160",NA,0,NA,"false",1522302104,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","false","linkflairlabel","","false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/84c160/question_from_a_crypto_beginner/","","",NA,"Question","",0,1

Secondly, if I were to transfer it back - how do I do that? I'm slightly confused.

Third, is there a minimum amount that needs to be kept in MEW or can I transfer everything from there and have a 0 balance?

Fourth, what would be the transaction fee? I know it depends on Gas price, but help me out here - Assume I'm transferring 1000 REQ from MEW to Binance - what's my fee? Is that fee recovered in REQ or ETH ? 
Does the same fee apply if I transfer from Binance to MEW?

Appreciate all the help.

Thanks,

My question is this, and I’m sorry if it’s basic or obvious: if someone sends me a request for $5, how can I actually transmit $5 without sharing my routing and account number with a third party? Won’t I still be required to trust my information with a third party at the application layer?

I have been reading through the WP and want to initiate a conversation about the Request whitepaper.
Before I elaborate my feedback, I want to make sure everyone understands where I am coming from. I have a mixed background in Network Engineering (my actual job) and Business Administration (which I studied and still actively enjoy learning about). Hence my knowledge of accounting is very educational, meaning I mostly learned it in university but had little exposure in real-life. I am aware that this might bias my judgement. So far for the disclaimer.
Now to the actual point of my post ;) 
I feel that the whitepaper could use a more scientific approach. What I mean by that is:

•	A clearer structure. I generally think that each chapter should describe a subject beginning to end. Ideally the last sentence closes a “circle” from the beginning sentence and “rounds it up”. From writing papers in the university (again this is my experience) I always follow an approach where I first bring up the current challenges. 
In Requests case this would be inefficient bookkeeping methods, since data must be manually or automatically transferred to the account software. Or the problem of different FIAT and cryptocurrencies. I am saying it is important to make the reader aware of the current challenges that lead to the approach to develop Request – which is to make opportunities out of these challenges. Now that you have put those things in the readers mind he/she will be excited to learn how Request can fix it. This is where you roll out the uses-cases and completely dazzle the reader.

•	More repetitive wording of key terms such as Request Network, Request, Ledger, … to emphasize how Request adds value to the underlying blockchain (Ethereum) and put key terms in reader’s mind, this is basically marketing 101.

•	Provide more technical explanation for unsavy readers. Let’s take the terms ledger and the blockchain. The WP briefly explains the ledger to be as the entity which keeps track of Requests. Then in chapter 3 it says that Bob submits the Request to the blockchain. Now, first I think it should say that Bob submits the Request to the Request Ledger. Second, in one of the chapters before that there should have been a brief explanation how the Ledger is connected to the blockchain. Sure, for me it is obvious that Request is a layer upon the Ethereum blockchain, but for a lot of readers I think it is not.

•	Even more Numbers. My professor always said “you can build any theory and have good arguments but without number is worth nothing”. Hence, I think it would be helpful and professional to add more numbers (and of course with reliable sources). How much do CC vendors charge? How much can Request accelerate payments? Chapter 4.3.2 is a good example for this. 

•	Updates. Chapter 6 (Roadmap) starts with: “Being finalized. A detailed roadmap will be posted here once ready”. It immediately puts in my head that this project is somewhere in its founding stages. This is not the case. Major milestones have been achieved (from what I understand most of them in time) – this needs to be communicated (both that they were achieved and on schedule). It is important.

Those are just some initial thoughts about the WP. Now I would like to hear some opinions.
Also, I am not here to only give feedback but also to contribute, so please feel free to share your ideas on how I could help.

I just want to remind you guys that March will be the month of Request Network, good to know that the team mentioned their on schedule of the roadmap. Apart from the launch of mainnet we will see the following (according to the Q1 roadmap): 

* Deploy management of crypto-currencies to Request (ERC20 tokens...)
* Launching the ""Pay with Request"" project: an online button which will offer an alternative to the traditional ""Pay with Paypal"" and ""Pay with credit card"" methods
* Outside audits of the Request Contracts
* Proof of concept: Request Core working with a Bitcoin Oracle
* Information about apps and development by external devs on the Request platform (also see the first app, announced earlier this week)

And probably a new partnership with an accounting, payment or audit firm as mentioned on their roadmap. 

Just keep in mind that after tomorrow there are just 2 bi-weekly updates coming (16 and 30 March).
 

**There's even more coming in q2**

With fiat integration being the most important and interesting development. That will create important opportunities for mass adoption of the Request network. In addition to that, we can except new dapps released by teams participating in the Request Hub.

I work for one of the Big 4 accounting firms, and I can see a clear need for companies to use the REQ platform in the future. However, a big risk is the auditable-ness (not sure if this is a real word) of these transactions. Has REQ already partnered with an accounting firm? 

I am not asking whether REQ has selected an auditor, but instead whether REQ has teamed up with an accounting advisor who can provide accounting consulting services to REQ's business clients? A similar example would be VeChain partnering with Pwc (no shill intended).

That can cause some issues in my opinion.
Correct me if I'm wrong please.

EDIT: Just read though today's update again and it says ""As the Request Network is operational on the Ethereum blockchain, every creation of a Request now requires a minor fee.""

I think this might create a problem for adoption (prior to full fiat integration), as a person who has heard nothing about crypto will need to have bought and deposited crypto into his wallet.

Moreover, people who have no money currently, cannot receive any via the Request Network.

I notice that occasionally when someone posts their doubts about REQ, they get aggressive responses, reaking of ""im smarter than you,  how dare you doubt this amazing project you idiot and read the whitepaper you fucking moron""

There are many people who give kind, well thought out, and patient responses and I applaud you. This is the way the community should be.

However the negativity is unnecessary, and someone trying to give constructive criticism of the project should be encouraged (even if the question is kind of dumb, has been answered a million times and could be found with a simple search).

I truly believe in this project, and I am also a bag holder at this point, with no plans to sell for at least another year.

Most people in the crypto community are well aware of REQ at this point, meaning there will be no FOMO bull run like there was in December. If anything, I see REQ dropping in price soon after main net release after many don't see the increase in price that they've been waiting for. Look to KNC as a perfect example of this. The only thing that might help REQ's chances of a bull run with main net is if BTC is doing the same. Does anyone else feel this way?

EDIT: I learned the difference between the coins and just invested in REQ. Thanks guys. If anyone cares, my decision was based on the fact that request network is not a *currency* while nano is and personally, I prefer investments that incorporate real life applications. REQ does this. However, I do not like to invest in cryptocurrencies that want to be used as currency (except DOGE)

I just heard about the [WooCommerce Plugin](http://wooreq.com) for Request like 2 hours ago and immediately integrated it into our [German T-Shirt store](https://cryptoonstuff.com). **The installation couldn't be any easier** - a good start I thought to myself.

I was waiting long for Request to finally launch in such a way and was curious about how the **payment process** is going to work. 

I have just tested it and like... I am stunned. I just told my friend **""If someone were to install MetaMask for your grandma and set up ETH, then even your grandma with absolutely no understanding of all of this crypto stuff, would be able to pay.""**

You literally press 3 buttons and you are all set!

**A huge step for adoption! Great job Request team** - keep it up! You are making it so easy for us small stores (well all stores) to accept crypto in a very elegant and easy-to-use way! 

**Thank you for that.**

**Edit: Thank you guys for all the attention this post is getting. We are receiving a lot of orders with cancelled payments haha ;) Glad you guys want to test Request out.

I did some googling and can’t find the answer I’m looking for so maybe someone can help (reddit searching is not good). 

I understand the value of REQ invoicing and accounting savings, but what if someone inputs information incorrectly, and needs to change it? 

I use expensify a lot for work, and sometimes have to go into a report to change something. Since REQ is an immutable ledger, of a person/company had to adjust something, what would that process be?

I've been researching REQ lately and while all the recent news  seems very positive, I can't quite understand why the value of the REQ token should go up over time.

It seems to me as though payments through the REQ invoicing platform will be in ethereum, or in the future with fiat, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Why then would you not just hold ethereum?

I guess what I'm really seeking clarification on is what makes REQ worth investing in? What mechanism ensures that the token itself is valuable, in comparison to the ETH token or BTC?

Thanks for any replies and sorry if my questions are a bit basic.","false","8c4b8m",NA,0,NA,"false",1529590184,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","false","linkflairlabel",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/8c4b8m/please_eli5_what_gives_the_req_token_value/","t3_8c4b8m",NA,NA,"Question","",0,0

I'm a poor college student so I like to be careful with every dollar I spend so forgive me if these have all been answered a million times or are obvious. 

1. What exactly will fiat integration look like? For example, if I want to send dollars using Venmo I can connect my bank account to the Venmo app, move money into my account and then send it to a friend who can receive it fairly quickly. I understand REQ has use cases beyond the Paypal/Venmo one, but how will this work with REQ? How exactly can I move US dollars from myself to someone else using REQ, will there be tokens issued? And will REQ have any advantages over current fiat payment services or is it more about sending and receiving crypto (for example, Venmo has no fees for many payments and just added an ""instant transaction"" feature which allows you to send money in 30 minutes or less for a 25 cent fee)? 

2. There are many projects that are discussing ""tokenized assets"", will these be able to be integrated into the Request Network as well? 

3. REQ is a dApp built on Ethereum? And REQ also has dApps being built on it? What is the fundamental difference between Ethereum as a platform to built dApps and Request Network as a platform to build dApps? You couldn't build something like cryptokitties on REQ for example, could you? Can anyone build dApps on Request? Could a Binance like exchange be built on REQ where each coin could be traded against any other coin? 

4. How significant will the token burn be, and will it provide enough incentive to hold REQ over other tokens? I posted this on /biz/ but didn't really get a response (I think the chans are having some technical difficulties today):

""From the update today, we know that REQ is launching a crowdfunding dApp which will make ICOs both cheaper and more reliable for people looking to do them. ""More than $5.6 billion of capital was raised in 2017 according to the metrics used by the TokenData team,"" the report says. ""This compares to $1 billion of 'traditional' venture investing in blockchain startups in the same time frame and a 'mere' $240 million raised by token sales in 2016"" Source: http://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-raised-icos-2017-tokendata-2017-2018-1

Now, suppose all the money raised in ICOs last year was raised on the Request Network. That would move 5.6 billion dollars across the network, and at a fee of .5% that's 23 million dollars in fees. If all 23 million was used to buy REQ at its current price (20 cents), that would be 112 million tokens bought and burnt. However, as tokens are bought the price goes up, so the actual number bought and burnt would likely be a lot lower. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/request-network/historical-data/?start=20130428&amp;end=20180413

From CMC volume tracking, we can see that on Jan 1, 100 million dollars in volume was traded on REQ and the price opened at 60 cents and closed at 82 cents. 100 million is 4 times the amount of total fee volume we'd see if all of 2017's ICO funds were raised on REQ. Also, the 23 million dollars is assuming a .5% fee, which is likely higher than it would be if the network were being used a lot (could be as low as .1%, which would lower fee volume to 4.5 million dollars in a year).""

Is the token burning really going to have a large effect even if REQ is used? I can see that if someone came in and market bought 23 million dollars worth of REQ right now it would skyrocket the price, but what about if it was spread over a year?

Is token burning still part of the plan? The SEC was pretty clear in the case of Munchee that burning tokens was one of the reasons that they classified the tokens as a security and not a utility token. This is also the reason why QSP (also Ycombinator backed and I assume are using Ycombinator's legal resources) are not burning tokens. To be clear, I like the concept of REQ and burning makes the tokens a very attractive proposition, but am worried that because the company is US based they could fall foul of the SEC. Especially as tokens are being traded on exchanges that dont require proof that buyers are non US.

I don't know if the REQ team browse this subreddit, but whatever, might as well take a chance with nothing to lose.

The comment:

Now if only REQ could get the Fiat integration sorted. The ability to pay with crypto AND fiat in as simple and easy way and with less transaction costs than PayPal is the ticket to Margaritaville. I want to say, although all these little apps they've been working on lately are kind of nice and all, that nothing else matters at this point and that fiat integration is the absolutely necessary link to adoption without which this project will fail with 100% certainty.

Normies currently are babies unable to walk when it comes to crypto adoption. You might not be able to see this since you're a grown, running man in this sense. However what you cannot expect these people to do is go directly from crawling to running. Regular businesses for example will not integrate Request if it means complicating their checkout process for 99.9% of consumers in order to better serve the .1% who want to pay with cryptocurrencies.

REQ needs to be a one-stop-shop for all forms of currency to be viable. The goal needs to be to ""bleed"" consumers from using fiat to using cryptos as blockchain and the internet of value take over, not to try and force people from black to white overnight.

Please REQ team if you're reading this, make Fiat-integration a priority.

We know this.


What's the primary obstacle to this occurring?  
Simple lack of awareness of Request as a viable and ideal option.


People like to come here and read stuff.  Click.  Read.  Click click, etc.
They do so generally hoping to have their optimism stoked re: the future of this platform.


How about, instead of just coming here and upvoting to the choir, we send out calls to ""mass-notify"" certain services (Wikipedia, for example) of our desire to see them implement a decentralized, highly transparent and open source payment, auditing, and accounting solution ala REQUEST NETWORK?


They get a message from one person about this, fair enough.  They read and likely forget.  They get messages from 10, 50, 100 people.  An impression is made.  They dig further.  Something may be catalyzed.


We MAKE REQUEST successful.  We are no longer passively waiting, relying solely on the core team.  


You want to see REQ make it?  Why not harness a fraction of your clicking and typing power to do so?


I'll make a call to get things started.
It's a call some will disagree with.  That's ok.  I'm not mad at you.
If you disagree with my call, don't participate.  Make your own call and I will very likely participate, because all I care about is Request Network's success.

We all know the guy, it always feels like he's trying to push something on you or sell you something and doesn't really care about you as a person, you're just a means for him to make money. 

One thing I've noticed on YouTube lately is a lot more people have donation links in their descriptions because videos are often demonetized. I think a REQ wallet address where people could donate any crypto to them would be really convenient (sometimes I'll see people listing 4 or 5 different cryptos with each individual address, this is both inconvenient because it only lists a few and it looks cluttered with all the different addresses). I think REQ would give them a convenient solution when it's fully running, but how do you make them aware of this without making yourself seem like a scammer? This might seem like a goofy question, but when you don't know this person (you're just some random guy online) and the crypto community doesn't exactly have the greatest reputation right now, it's not that strange of a concern. With an obscure platform like Request it is something that people need to be made aware of, but I don't want to make it seem scammy or like I'm pushing something on people just to make money.

What's the best way of going about this? ","false","8cy2z7",NA,0,NA,"false",1529605181,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","false","linkflairlabel",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/8cy2z7/the_practicality_and_ethics_of_shilling_your_coin/","t3_8cy2z7",NA,NA,"Question","",0,1

Simply trying to open a dialogue to hopefully help the community of investors stay as informed as possible. Also, I am not acknowledging short term price reactions for a reason, I am only concerned with the long-term success of the platform.

I know the recent announcement of the partnership with PWC is exciting, but too many are running around reddit touting it as “REQ just partnered with one of the Big 4 US accounting firms!” - when in reality, the partnership is with PWC France. Unfortunately, it is not the same thing. If any of you have seen the documentary “The China Hustle” (highly recommend), they actually directly address this issue. Small-cap Chinese companies were listed on large US exchanges through reverse mergers, and US investment banks initiated this process and sold shares in these companies and enormously profited. However, these companies were dramatically over-inflating their balance sheets and revenue numbers - thus leading to a skyrocketing stock price. How were these companies/investment banks able to pull this off? They used brand name audits from the Big 4 to give the shady companies a “stamp of approval”, but instead of using the centrally based operations (which would be much more likely to find issues/discrepancies), they used the Chinese based operations (aka “PWC China”). Different offices of these firms operate completely on their own and the merit of a “Deloitte China” does not equal that of simply “Deloitte”.

In fact, the documentary even uses PWC as an example. Quote from the documentary -“Many of these companies will say - ‘Well look, we are being audited by PWC’ - no they’re not, they’re being audited by PWC China, which is like a franchise, it’s not really PWC”

The fact of the matter is, PWC France is nowhere near the same as a partnership with PWC. However, it is still a step in the right direction. I think it’s highly important to remain informed and keep ourselves grounded in the present, the time will come when Request has a real major partnership - they are incredibly early in their development. 

If anyone in this sub has specific insights in to PWC France and their merit, this would be a great place to share so we can learn more about their accomplishments and promise separately from the main operations of PWC.

I never actually knew this, but I think this actually has sealed the deal for me as far as investing in this token (I was on the fence before, but reading the reviews for this company made me realize the REQ devs are no joke). 

Moneytis, as far as I understand it, is just a site that aggregates data on international transfer rates and gives consumers the cheapest choice for sending money. Supposing REQ gets fiat integration figured out, will this service direct a lot of volume to the network? I suppose it might depend on what the fiat solution actually is. 

What was the reason for the Request team moving away from Moneytis and focuing on Request? Was there ever a stated reason? Will the two ever work together in any fashion?

This is huge because we are talking about hundreds of tokens being integrated into Request which makes the platform ready for mass adoption. 

I’m expecting real world adoption here and not just “partnerships”. 

As an example, I do like the idea Verge is now accepted in PornHub but I still do not see adoption there. How many people actually pay for such service and from which how many of them actually own Verge? Instead for PornHub being only limited to one token, they can switch to Request And accept all ERC20 tokens they prefer. 

This is not a moon post for Request but we are definitely one step closer to mass adoption for this community. 

I usually compare Request to Ethereum when it first came out. People who bought at cents saw the potential because it was unlimited and is still is. I fortunately see the same case with Request Network. Unlimited use cases once those dapps start coming out to life. 

Good luck to all the investors.

We are excited to announce that we have been working on a donation/fundraising platform powered by Request Network! Our goal is to build a powerful all-in-one platform full of tools for creators, and to provide a frictionless donation experience to donors.

&amp;nbsp;

In addition to announcing the project for the first time, we would like to invite you all to join our beta!

###Anyone can join here: www.GetDonaid.com


&amp;nbsp;


There are so many details we wish we could share right now but because of the projects current stage we are hesitant to. We would rather underpromise and overdeliver- than overpromise and underdeliver. Hopefully you all understand the position we are in :) We promise that more information will be available soon and we will continue to post updates as development continues!

###That being said, here are a few things to look forward to:
- Creator dashboard
- Donor management
- Donation analytics
- Streamlabs and StreamElements integrations (we are very excited about this one)
- Extremely low fees
- Effortless form creation
- Donation page customization
- Donation form customization
- Frictionless donor experience
- Embeddable forms
- Custom receipts
- Automatic email responses

&amp;nbsp;

We are super excited to be working on this project and we can't wait to let you guys try it out. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to comment on this thread so everyone can see! 

&amp;nbsp;

###Thanks! More information will be coming soon!

I think request could really benefit from adding DAO as a payment option, as a solution to send and receive fiat until an implementation with a fiat oracle is working. 

Unless this implementation automatically is integrated with the ERC-20 support? Thought this also was going to be the case with DGX, however there was a seperate announcement for that. 

Also, maybe the subreddit would benefit from having weekly discussion + price threads. I believe this feature has already been suggested a few times, but now the subreddit 'hot' page is filled with the daily threads.

Thanks for considering my questions. This is a great looking token.","false","897tx8",NA,0,NA,"false",1529538107,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","false","linkflairlabel",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/897tx8/have_a_few_questions_about_req/","t3_897tx8",NA,NA,"Question","",0,0

Just an idea. If Req’s price reaches past a certain threshold, I will seriously consider it (cost/benefit more favorable).    

I have questions, however, for you and the team u/AdmREQ    

1. Would the team even allow us to do this? Are there copyright concerns in a decentralized world?    

2. Can you the community propose a design? I was thinking something like their website header: “Request Network” with “The future of commerce” below that with white lettering on a Req blue background.    

3. We could also crowdfund this project if there’s enough interest, using the Req crowdfunding app. The funds could be sent to a trusted team member, escrow, or something like that.

I apologize in advance if this is not allowed but I'm really excited to help spread the adoption of cryptocurrency in general and REQ in particular. 

Our business provides e\-commerce solutions to small and medium sized businesses and we've just started accepting cryptocurrencies for all non\-subscription products. The products I think would be most applicable to this sub are:

1. DropShip Business Creation \- We'll set you up with a Shopify store, products, a business plan among other things to get you going. Unfortunately, req hasn't made it's way to Shopify yet \(as far as I'm aware\) but we'll install other cryptocurrency payment processors at no cost.
2. Website Development \- Pretty standard but this is on Wordpress and is for much more advanced sites.

•	Bounty program for BTC oracle and ERC-20 tokens.

•	BTC on mainnnet.

•	ERC-20 tokens on mainnet (DGX, DAI, OMG, KNC &amp; REQ).

•	Launch of [Request Crowdfunding Dapp]( http://crowdfunding.request.network/)

•	Request going to Consensus 2018 and attending pre-scheduled meetings (14 – 16 May).

•	Improved Request Library for developers (more intuitive and easier to use).


# Highly possible


•	Wikimedia France implements Request Donation button in May.

•	Other Organizations implement the Request Donation button in May.

&gt; The first version of the DApp is slated for end of May. The best part is that we’re working closely together with several organizations that will use the product once it goes live!

•	New Partnerships (At least the confirmation of another organization to use the Request donation button).

•	**New Roadmap** (This deserves its own post, to speculate on new additions and strategy changes, will make a post about this next week).


# Speculation


•	**New Website** This is by far my biggest speculation, and I believe a new roadmap could possible come with a new website, one that works as an index for all the request network websites and Dapps, links to installation of the request payment button, easy integration of the new roadmap, and of course an Improved UI&amp;UX.

•	New Request Dapp comes out.

•	New Hire(s) (Team still looking for active talent, https://request.network/#/jobs), also they are open to new positions not listed in jobs, mail to jobs@request.network.

•	New Crypto/Business partnerships.


I want to hear your ideas! Feel free to point out any speculations you guys may have and if I missed something here please tell me.


### Edit

•	**Speculation:** Shopify Integration.

•	**Speculation:** Partnership with OMG, so far we have a partnership/collaboration with 4 out of the 5 initial ERC-20 tokens to be initially added to Request. We also have a connection to Omg via Kyber Network, so thinking there could be something in the works with Omg and Req is not improbable.

I'm trying to compile a list of all the Request Network (and 0x but this topic is dedicated to REQ) partnerships BUT only ones which have their own coin/token and work to drive the use/burn rate of REQ, so this rules out as great as they are the likes of Wikipedia &amp; PwC.
 
 
For example BEE token, if BEE takes off, it will drive the REQ burn rate since BEE will accept crypto payments using REQ. And vice versa, BEE would benefit from REQ becoming the de facto cryptocurrency payments service.
 
 
The same concept can be said for 0x and a number of it's partners, REQ for example.
 
 
 
0x (ZRX) - An Open Protocol For Decentralized Exchange On The Ethereum Blockchain.
 
Kyber Network (KNC) - An instant decentralized cryptocurrency exchange service.
 
FundRequest (FND) - A decentralized marketplace for open source collaboration.
 
Civic (CVC) - Decentalized identity &amp; reusable KYC.
 
The Bee Token (BEE) - Decentralized Home Sharing Network.
 
iExec RLC - (RLC) - Blockchain-based Fully Distributed Cloud Computing.

And I know that the team will release a new rodemap that will show the project future plans but still to bring some clarity for me and for athers I want to ask some questions about it.


1. Is the Fiat integration going to happen this year?

2. How many currencies the Fiat integration will include?

3. Will the Fiat integration will affect the speed of the transaction (will it make it slower)?

4. And lastly is the Fiat integration will be Depended on some kind of organization to work?

I read the white paper and I've been holding req  for some time.
I'm not trying to spread fud in any way I'm just curious.

**Why is this?**

Well out of the 5 initial ERC-20 tokens (DGX, DAI, OMG, KNC &amp; REQ) that are coming to Request in May, we have a partnership with DGX, DAI &amp; KNC. So we are missing a reason to include OMG.

**How will it work?**

Request has connections to OMG via: Kyber Network, Quantstamp and MakerDao. ~~Also their Head of Growth **Kevin Xu** is Y-Combinator [Source](https://blog.omisego.network/@imkevinxu).~~ (Kevin left Omg on the 16th April).

**Request** can benefit from Omg DEX, which will give them an alternative to Kyber, for liquidity purposes and conversion rates. Most importantly Request will be able to use Omg Money Gateway to provide Fiat integration and Cash-in out possibilities. Ultimately increasing the transaction volume for both.

**OmiseGo** can benefit from Request by adding Invoicing, Accounting and Auditing to their services. Making the adoption of payments on the blockchain a fully competitive and improved version to what is on existence right now.

**Conclusion**

A partnership between OmiseGo and Request will strengthen their value propositions and reinforce the new financial freedom both teams are aiming to achieve.

**Other reason for adding OMG instead of a partnership**

1.	OMG has the biggest marketcap for a ERC-20 token that will indeed remain an ERC-20 token.

2.	OMG has one of the biggest communities in crypto, adding OMG will help showcase Request to OMG holders, that by default are interested in financial Dapps, so having a exposure to Request could incite interest among them on the project.

Unfortunately we have learned that our announced partnership with Wikimedia France has come to an end. After a conversation between the French team and us, they have let us know that they want to pull out of the partnership due to ""the way we initially \(mis\)communicated on the partnership publicly"".

We mistakingly reported our partnership to be with the Wikimedia Foundation using the Wikipedia logo in our April 27th blogpost. After getting notified quickly about this mistake by both the French team and the broader crypto community, we updated the announcement within 24 hours on the 28th of April. The updated article changed all Wikimedia Foundation references to the actual partner, Wikimedia France, and changed the incorrect use of the Wikipedia logo to the correct logo of Wikimedia France.

Unfortunately, if we understand correctly, this wasn't quick enough for Wikimedia France and is the reason for this partnership to end.

**Lesson learned.** We miscommunicated, which resulted in a partnership ending that had great potential for both. We did not see this coming and we are not here to judge the Wikimedia France team. We do respect their decision.

We're sad to see this relationship come to an end as our visions are still very much in line. The relationship we had together on fundraising for good could have made a real impact on the world. We will always keep the doors open for the Wikimedia France team to come back to us when they feel they are ready.

The end of this partnership will not hinder us from achieving even greater things in the fundraising space. We will continue to fully focus on delivering what we are working on, from both a product and partnership perspective.

Sincerely,The Request Network Foundation","false","8mxdxh",NA,0,NA,"false",1529785362,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","false","linkflairlabel",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/8mxdxh/clarification_on_wikimedia_france/","t3_8mxdxh",NA,NA,"Info","",0,1

When I first found out that Wikimedia France broke its partnership with Request I felt disappointed and I blamed both sides. However, after doing some research I found out some interesting information that I wanted to share with all of you:

On the 27th of April an email is sent by someone called u/geniice saying that she did not approve the partnership and also showing her concern about Req claiming a partnership with Wikimedia Foundation rather than Wikimedia France:

“*Ok. I don't approve but I'm not french so not its not an area where I*

*can reasonably expect anyone to pay any attention to my opinions.*

*What concerns me is that they have retweeted something claiming the*

*partnership is with the wikimedia foundation rather than just*

*wikimedia france*”

Following her email she received this response:

“*Sorry it's a mistake, the partnership is with WMFr. We will correct that Tweet*”

And this is followed by an email from Nadine clarifying that Req had until the 1st May to solve this misunderstanding:

*“After the week\-end and labor day \(1 May\), we are expecting that alloccurrences of this misunderstanding have disappeared.”*

Easy, right? Wikimedia France corrects that tweet, Req clarifies the misunderstanding \(which they did in less than 24 hours\) and sorted. However, something catched my attention. In her email it is written: *“sorry for the intempestive and unwelcome communication about this local partnership.”*

Intempestive and unwelcome communication? The partnership was indeed done with Wikimedia France and surely this is not agreed with anyone who is “up to working with Wikimedia France”. The rest of the Wikimedia Foundation team who participated in this conversation seemed bothered about this partnership and rather than talking directly with Wikimedia France or the Req team the conversation stays there. In order to understand their views about blockchain I believe it is very important to share the rest of their emails:

Comments from someone called David Gerard:

\- “*""blockchain"" anything is a boondoggle at best and horribly damaging at worst, and you really don't want to go near this actively terrible rubbish.”*

\- *“Actual blockchain expert here! As in, I wrote a book about it that's sold well and the BBC calls me an expert now.”*

\- *About Req: “it's incredibly clunky, painful and disappointing and largely doesn't work. Also, it only offers Ethereum.”*

Comment from someone called Vito:

“*You surely saw the same dudes who sold anything as ""Internet of things"" a couple of years ago selling the same black boxes as ""blockchain"" now. I expect these black boxes to be labeled as ""enhanced by artificial intelligence"" by mid 2019 :D*”

Someone called Romaine seems to be more open\-minded about the benefits of the blockchain technology:

*“We in Belgium received a mail with a question if we want to work together with a blockchain organisation. For us to develop that it is too much work, and we suggested them to contact WMF to develop a system we could easily adopt ourselves. It can be interesting to use blockchain technology in our movement for transparency purposes.*”

However, these were the responses that she received:

*Geniice: “Not really. At best you end up with a less efficient version of a downloadable database. People claiming that ""blockchain technology"" is useful for things are either cyptocurrency advocates \(with the usual conflicts of interest\) or third parties trying to be nice to them.*”

Geniice clearly does not agree with blockchain technology.

And Jim says:“*Less efficient unless a government authority is attempting to censor. After advocating all this year for the Turkish Wikipedia on IPFS, Ivery recently learned that it has been a success for a year now.  So I propose that we use IPFS for any project that is at risk ofgovernment censorship*.”

This comment leaves clear that their focus would be on censorship but they would not use blockchain technology for that purpose. They asked the Req team to mend the misunderstanding, which they did. However, when they had to show their professionalism rather than communicating with the Req team first they publicly published a rude email and deleted all posts. This is disrespectful not only towards the Req team but towards the whole community and this is made clear in all their emails regarding the blockchain technology. While I don´t have all the information and I don´t know whether the Req team should have done more or not, what seems clear to me is that Wikimedia Foundation is not in favor of adopting blockchain technology. However, they should have discussed this before agreeing a partnership.

Please see the latest update from Wikimedia France: “\**Post\-scriptum:\* no other cryptocurrency donations project is planned*”.

I've seen a lot of people disappointed that the Request Team hasn't made an effort to market the platform yet. However, my opinion is that since the platform's core features haven't been implemented yet, it could lead to potential long\-term users trying out this super early build of the platform; becoming disappointed in it and never looking into it again. 

Once they get atomic swaps with decentralised oracles to fulfil requests, I think then would be a good time to market it. It just seems like a waste to spend their 75000000REQ marketing budget  \(that's correct isn't it? \[[https://blog.request.network/request\-networks\-token\-sale\-terms\-overview\-ca4278606c3](https://blog.request.network/request-networks-token-sale-terms-overview-ca4278606c3)\]\) at this very moment, when it would be more efficient to launch a large scale marketing campaign when Request Network's utility has clear advantages over it's competitors.

When performing the ICO there was a data breach where all email recipients received phishing emails and people wanting to participate ended up losing $1 million. The team has always said they were looking into it and said initially that they would respond in 30 days. That was 4 months ago. As the team have taken so long to report on the phishing attempt / loss of personal data from the ICO. As they have not officially acknowledged it before the 25th May which is when GDPR became into force. You now have to report a breach within 72 hours or risk heavy fines. I take it this will be addressed in your monthly update tomorrow?

Could get an awful lot of reports as there were a lot that participated in the ICO

Now that the lead developer left to start his own project, how many full time developers do you have that work on nothing but bee token? [https://www.beetoken.com/](https://www.beetoken.com/) shows the members of your team but Guocheng Xie doesn't work for you he works for UBER and Bonnie Qin doesn't work for you either she works for google. I would refer to your whitepaper but that is out of date \(includes the head of business development who left shortly after the ICO as well as David Peterson​ \(head of marketing\) who the telegram admin didn't even know who they were? So am I right in thinking you now have 3 full time devs? \- Kevin Van Senior front end developer, Andy Khong \(Junior front end developer\) and Rob Peterson \(Smart Contract engineer\)

The 6 month vesting period for 25&amp;#37; of the team allocation I believe is due on the 2nd June? Can you confirm the date? And I make it the team are able to sell 18,875,000 bee tokens and thus circulating supply increasing by that amount as well? and every month after an additional 1/24 will be available to sell \(3,145,833.33 bee tokens\)

Is the beenest website up to date?

Whats the smart contract address used for beenest so can see how popular the service is?

How come you banned me just now, deleted my posts and were insistant that I asked via PM rather than letting other people in the community aware of the answers.

I myself am pretty neutral on it as I expected the FIAT integration to get pushed back a little. What made me an impression are the words of /u/korgijoe 

It's really refreshing to see a community that has valid criticisms, expresses them in a (mostly) *mature* way and doesn't turn into an echo chamber or leaves a project the moment things look a little bit tough.

I think this summer will be a cornerstone for crypto. No, I'm not talking about prices, new money entering, institutional investors or whatever.

What I mean is that a lot of teams will have to start getting to the core of their projects. And - as at least I expect, some of them might fail to stick to the roadmaps they initially proposed.

I'm seeing some tension in the subs of a couple of projects I like - notably here, and OmiseGo's sub. What we discussed over there is that the typical crypto investor (a.k.a. speculator) is pretty young and immature in terms of market experience/business processes. Which usually leads to over the top expectations.

What doesn't help is the fact that crypto calls for aggressive marketing and satisfying the never-ending ADHD hypetrain. Otherwise, as some people point out all the time, 'you're dead'. Hence we got quite spoiled during the autumn/winter/early spring season, with the constant stream of partnerships, flashy promises and whatnot.

On one hand, it's understandable. Everyone loves being kept in touch with the current progress. On the other hand, imagine the additional stress added to figuring out all the intricacies of what these projects want to tackle.

Imho as this REQ update hints, we're entering a kind of a cool down period. Doubt, some disappointment and re-alignment of roadmaps will have to occur all across crypto. Businesses are a complicated, fickle thing - and businesses who aim at doing a financial x technological revolution are, well, insanity.

Some people might get frustrated and leave.

This is par for the course. Let's remind ourselves to stay alert and voice our concerns/demand of clarifications, but at the same time respect the team. In the end, blockchain is something that is still a road filled with question marks even for the greatest of minds. We're still at the murky beginning of what's to come - and we can't even be sure **what form** will it take when it gets deployed. Not talking only about REQ, but about the whole ecosystem.

Remember the gradual evolution of the Internet. Things didn't happen in several Qs. A lot of the projects - even the quality ones aren't even 2 years old. Most of them have been here for an year or so! Imagine wanting an Amazon suite of services like Prime, Echo etc. in 2002!

Sorry for the longer post, just needed to mention this. Let's keep up the great work, REQmarines.

3. Redditors generally think short-term, both during Bear and Bull markets. They don't look at the big picture of the entire history of crypto. They only see about a month in either direction. There are equal numbers of unreasonable optimists and unreasonable pessimists. 

4. Generally, subreddits for individual coins are highly biased towards that coin, but the majority of the bias comes from the users being financially and emotionally invested, not logical supporters of the technology.

5. r/cryptocurrency is full of people who like to troll, insult, and criticize any and everyone. Some of these people are biased against crypto in general, some are Ethereum / BTC purists, others are just plain old trolls who like to see the world burn. Very few can provide reasonable arguments to back up their FUD or negativity, and generally turn to insults when challenged.

6. There are many groups out there who want to manipulate the market, or manipulate the perception of a certain coin or its competitors. A lot of these folks post on Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook, purely to cloud the message in favor of whatever will make them money. These groups organize behind the scenes, and use social media strategically to manipulate people. The organized pump&amp;dump scamlords are always out there, actively manipulating (or planning to manipulate) the market to serve their interests. 

7. Actual products / real-world cases are exceedingly rare in crypto, and crypto supporters are often too quick to forgive a lack of a real product, use case, or reputable leader because they want to lambomoon. So, companies without any real product are worshipped, and their CEOs made into pseudo-celebrities, even though nobody had heard of them two months ago and they haven't done anything truly remarkable. (Yet!) 

Basically, it's one big clusterfuck of people trying to get rich, accompanied by tons of other people who just like to poke holes and cause drama. Reason, tempered expectations, and kindess are unfortunately exceptions to the rule.

I personally support Req because I like the team, and I think they're delivering on their roadmap efficiently. But I also can't pretend that I'm an expert. I don't know if Req will still be around in ten years. I don't know if they'll manage to build something that another company can't swoop in and do 10X better. But I'm taking the risk on Req because it feels right to me, but it would be silly to pretend that it's anything other slightly-educated feelings.","false","8m4wcm",NA,0,NA,"false",1529771181,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","false","linkflairlabel",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/8m4wcm/some_important_things_to_keep_in_mind_about_the/","t3_8m4wcm",NA,NA,"Discussion","",0,1

Some of the issues I see arise are this:

1: ""Fluid"" roadmaps. This takes away deadlines and allows them to stretch out the deadlines as far into the future as they want. Fiat integration, for example, is one thing they have been very quiet about that everyone wants to know if they are making progress towards or not.

2:Circulating Supply: If anyone hasn't noticed, 3 million tokens were added to the circulating supply, meaning that REQ devs sold at least 3 million to possibly fund other things. I would like to know just how many tokens they hold and plan to market sell on us holders.

3: Crowdfunding Dapp Pushed Back: As stated in their April 13th blog post, they slated the crowdfunding dapp to be released end of May. Well, it's May 25th and they only have a preview for it. This ties in with my first concern I listed, which shows that deadlines are becoming less and less concrete for the team.

I'm not a FUDer, I'm a guy who believes in REQ and has been closely watching and reading everything I can about the project. These are legitimate concerns I have about the direction this project is going.","false","8m549c",NA,0,NA,"false",1529771288,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","false","linkflairlabel",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/8m549c/concerns_i_have/","t3_8m549c",NA,NA,"Discussion","",0,0

I’ve been in crypto since 2011. I believe crypto will not survive if projects like Request do not succeed. People like Warren Buffett will continually FUD crypto until projects like Req solve fundamental problems.    
    
So, I’m realizing that in a decentralized model, it’s on us to help a project succeed. Talk to people you know about Req. Know any small business owners? Tell em, “there’s this payment button you can put on your website, it’s cutting edge.” Finance friends? “Hey, I’ve invested in this, take a look.” Or if you know big names, ask em what they think of Req.    
    
This network effect is critical to both the product and marketcap, whatever your goals are.     
    
I think the Req team has done a phenomenal job so far. They’re not perfect. I have my own criticisms (as posted before, mainly the lack of Asian marketing). It’s on us as a community to make this succeed. It’s on me and you to keep spreading the word. Talk to people, provide feedback for the team, engage—we can do this.

Long time lurker but my first post - burn away if it's horrible! 

I was thinking about [this community call to action post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RequestNetwork/comments/8ht2u4/call_to_action_req_community/) and the comments within to the tune of ""I see blockchain based solutions but clients have no awareness of the possibilities"". 

So, as someone that is not overly technical has been aware of blockchain for since bitcoin's conception but didn't have a real 'lightbulb' moment until I learned about ethereum - I see a ton of applications in my industry (I work for a big telecom) from supply chain to how we handle payroll and expenses to the deeper layers of our billing systems etc. 

Request was the second 'a-ha' moment I had in which the vision of the team and it's ability to disrupt wasted costs I experience everyday just made incredible sense. Thus, I'd love the community's feedback on the following idea: 

* start a website aimed at aggregating real world problems and blockchain-based solutions. I think that tribalism is one of the biggest things holding us back so this wouldn't be Request-exclusive and instead would just focus on creating a tangible potential solution for a real-world problem

* create a social/networking campaign on linked-in/various competency specific or professional communities to identify specific problems that could potentially have blockchain solutions

* solicit the communities of appropriate blockchain projects (for example, a payroll problem might get posted to the Request community) to identify what is possible/how to apply their solution to that problem

* Blog/summarize the problem and solution and aggregate on the website mentioned in the first point

Intended outcomes/whats in it for me: 

* the current climate of suggesting blockchain solutions is DYOR (probably a high barrier to entry for someone that isn't even skeptical yet because they don't know where to start) and the most commonly searched terms usually lead to schilling/speculative investment conversations which could increase skepticism

* The vast array of projects make it can make it difficult to understand. Ideally this wouldn't be another feature list like ""IOT &amp; DAAS"" (not really coherent but a copy/paste from a blockchain consulting group site that would be confusing for someone without a technical understanding) and instead be in real language (e.g. ""we pay X% every time employees submit expenses, here are three potential blockchain-based solutions)

* I'm looking for some experience in marketing and would love to think of a good hobby-project that I could use to cut my teeth on concepts that I may in the future apply professionally. Writing etc about blockchain would be a bonus.

Does anything like that exist and could we see the approach being a benefit for the Request &amp; other blockchain communities to support awareness and set the table for adoption? 

Thanks!

We hope you like it and if the req shopify plugin is there we will  integrate that as quick as we can!

Salesforce has an e-commerce platform that services top brands like Adidas, Columbia, Crocs(!), GoPro, HotTopic, and so many others.

They have a partner program that the Request Network team would have to join in order to develop a plugin (similar to Shopify).

This would be crazy good coverage for REQ. Imagine if even one of these top brands accepted cryptocurrency.

Unfortunately, I don't have a strong engineering background so I can't take the lead. Any other takers? Would like to get word of this to the Request team too.

&gt;There are several apps we are launching (including Accounting, Online payments, **POS payments**, Crowdfunding, Invoicing, **Supply chain and traceability**, Taxes…)


This 2 are part of the [tech mind map]( https://www.mindmeister.com/991002501?t=R1iofDilV0), so always planned. But I didn’t knew they were the new Dapps to come into development.


### POS Payments (Point of Sale)


Pretty straight forward: At the point of sale, the merchant calculates the amount owed by the customer, indicates that amount, prepares an **invoice** for the customer, and indicates the options for the customer to make payment.


Is going to be a game changer to have the option to pay with crypto on your favorite physical store, bar,café,cinema,mall,etc…


In here the question arises, will Req also develop the physical product or partner up with and existing POS provider, in order to integrate Request protocol to it in so it can accept cryptocurrency.


Pictures of POS (best way to explain it is by showing it): [POS]( https://www.google.cl/search?biw=1920&amp;bih=974&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;ei=B28EW9mMKcShwASs346wCw&amp;q=point+of+sale&amp;oq=point+of+sale&amp;gs_l=img.3..35i39k1l2j0i67k1j0l4j0i67k1j0j0i67k1.2205.3429.0.3744.10.7.0.0.0.0.95.365.7.7.0....0...1c.1.64.img..4.6.302...0i24k1j0i8i30k1.0.Ngu-qSylt8Q)

### Supply chain and traceability


This is the one that caught me by surprise.

In here we start to compete against Vechain and Waltonchain to name a few.

My theory here is that request will focus on the Blockchain side of things, while another company develops the physical goods to support the Blockchain supply chain.

We know that PwC France and Pwc Global are big on Supply chain as one of the best use cases for Blockchain. Could it be that this is one of the products Request is building with PwC Blockchain Labs? Or a client of PwC that wants to work with Request? Maybe a whole different company that has a connection to the team?

What are your ideas on this last one? How do you think it will work?

One of these solutions that I’ve been very excited about is the Crowdfunding platform as I see this as a huge opportunity to prove the value add of Request. 

As a beta tester of this Crowdfunding platform I wanted to share with you all my fundraiser in hopes that some of you will help both test the technology and raise funds for a very worthy cause. 

I chose to create a fundraiser for a local non-profit, no-kill dog rescue called SASS that is near and dear to the hearts of my fiancé and I as we rescued our own pup, Oakley, from them. The volunteers at SASS are doing extraordinary things on very limited funds - even rehabilitating very sick or injured dogs so they have a second chance at life. 

Please consider donating some ETH as 100% of the proceeds will go towards helping the amazing volunteers continue to save these pups in need and as a byproduct you’ll help test out this revolutionary tech! 

Thanks everyone!

Why are you still in REQ, and what makes you optimistic in the face of such a large drop in price? 

1. Most of the platform's capabilities aren't out yet. 

2. Decentralized financial applications make more sense than anything else at this point. The blockchain was invented to allow for peer to peer transfers of money. It seems obvious then that decentralized applications should focus on what blockchains are good at. To me, there's not a great reason for people to switch over en masse to a decentralized form of social media. Even if they are unsatisfied with current options, it's not clear that the benefits of decentralization are what they care about in a new platform. However, I think the benefits of decentralization (lower fees, faster transactions) are exactly what people care about with regards to financial applications. There's not a great reason to have something like GoFundMe or Kickstarter be centralized. I suppose fraudulent projects would be about it, but I think people would be willing to be more careful with their money if they could pay less in fees. 

3. The platform is totally currency agnostic. You could potentially have something like Venmo for dozens of different currencies with nearly free, nearly instant transactions if scaling issues are solved.

Seems like the entirity of crypto space is hating on this coin. Call it the worst performing coins of all time*. Though, its lost about 90%+ of its total value since ATH. Its continually improved on what the project is, and released awesome apps/plugins.

Seems the community is extremely hell-bent on fiat integration, and since it's not coming I guess they all sold for a loss and left the project. Now they're hating on it, attempting to encourage others to sell their ""shitbags""

Well, IM NOT SELLING BOYS! I love this project and believe in it, I want it to succeed more than anything. Not because it will make me rich (it won't, not even close)  but because I truly think this is a killer project that will shape up how we do things in day to day life, and business to business life.

I believe once the market enters a rally again (it will, just dont know when) we may see request take off some during that rally. 

If you guys are only in it for the price, now wouldnt be a better time to enter REQ. This was the price I originally entered at some time ago. Then I unfortunately caught some fomo and stocked up more at 75c. But I honestly couldn't care less. I think this is a solid project and it's a legit one. Things will happen, I have faith.

All the time, I see people complaining about the lack of marketing. What the fuck is the team going to market. Spending money on marketing in my opinion isn’t the most bang for your buck. Look at Kickstarter and Indiegogo projects who spend a fuckton on marketing and never deliver because they don’t have enough money to actually build the product. If req is short on money on building their project then that’s a different discussion, but in the current state req should focus on building out the product.

I’ve been involved in numerous successful and unsuccessful startups and at the end of the day all startups who end up dying is because of cashflow - nothing else.

1. The setup was incredible easy. I have a little bit of coding skills but I had to use none. Just a really easy 3\-step guide to setup.
2. When Req was setup I recieved two payments for some Request Merchandise \( duh :'\) \). One customer got an error: the customer placed the order and the Pay with Request button was not showing. The second time the problem did not occur. The other payment went smooth in terms of ordering. Only downside is that the customer gets to chose the gas price. I now have to wait 1.5 day because the customer selected 1 gwei. I don't blame the customer for choosing the gas fee but now I have to check the payments manually because I can't start with manufacuring the product\(s\).
3. Customers can order and can decide not to pay so I need to check all orders manually. It takes time and it is annoying because I have cancel some orders manually. I keep a record of people who deliberately not pay. I asked Adam about it and he responded nearly immediately \(like always\) and he said that when Request is an official Shopify app the payment will be before the order. 

So in general, it would be great if Request Network will become an official payment through Shopify, because with the orders and payments now it is not so easy for a shop to manually monitor all payments. A good thing is that you can pay directly via Metamask, Mew and that it is feeless! My other crypto payment processors always charge a fee. 

  
Btw, from every dime spend in our webshop all goes back directly in the market \(and a lot of Req\) so you basically help to increase the price when you buy a product from our store ;\). Also we \(me and a friend of mine\) are big fans of req and hodl a lot of req so \(obviously\) we made some Req designed merchandise.

Obviously they are speaking about public corporations, but I feel like this is fitting for our community right now as well.

""Quarterly earnings guidance often leads to an unhealthy focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term strategy, growth and sustainability.""

Or Focusing on the price of a coin often leads to an unhealthy focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term strategy, growth and sustainability.

""Reducing or even eliminating quarterly earnings guidance won't, by itself, eliminate all short-term performance pressures that U.S. public companies currently face, but it would be a step in the right direction.""

Let the team do what the team does best.  No need to pressure them too much, though a little kick in the butt sometimes may do the trick.  They have tons of outside pressure to deal with - Governments, current/potential partnerships, satisfying needs of the developers, and obviously, stake holders.  Patience, focusing on short term is not a successful business model.  These things take time.  

Having criticisms of the team is healthy, and it is good to voice your concerns, but remember, they are more invested than any of us and want to see this project succeed more than any of us.  Trust the process or dump your bags, your call.

"932713",1528493494,"RequestNetwork","ElitePrimal","self.RequestNetwork","https://www.reddit.com/r/RequestNetwork/comments/8pns4p/all_the_new_things_i_learned_on_the_last_project/",20,115,NA,NA,"All the new things I learned on the last Project update. Let’s discuss.","The only new information we got is the one on the AMA, so let’s get into the new things:

I didn’t add all the technical points, this all falls under protocol enhancement. 

•	**Staking** Almost all scaling solutions require staking, so looks like it will be a thing. The biggest candidates at the moment are Plasma and Terdermint. This is huge and will bring a new utility to the token (proof of burn and proof of stake can coexist), meaning people staking will get better rewards and the available supply will drop. Keep an eye up for how Plasma and Tendermint will work, chances are we will have the same model of staking.

•	**New Webiste** YES!!! This is one of the biggest news for me, a website speaks a lot about a company and it was time we got it updated, no date yet but I could see it up in the short term.


•	**Updating the Roadmap** The community asked and we got it, soon the team will add progression bars and later the new roadmap will be included on the new website and made more dynamic and interactive, also fixing the display.

•	**Governance** The team is looking for the best solution out there, also we got one of the functions governance will have “The governance utility will play a role in community voting for future utilities of the Request token”. This is great, we will be able to vote on new ways to use the token. 

•	**Kyber is still the main DEX** For cross-currency and other utility’s Kyber seems to be leading the DEX market.


•	**Team still talking and perusing exchange listings** We are missing Bittrex/Poloniex/Bithumb/Coinbase Pro to name a few.

•	**New Point of Sale and a Supply Chain and Traceability dApps** Bullish!! Especially when the partnership team is dedicating time to this. This both are huge markets and I’m really happy we are tackling them so early.


•	**Plans to add more support for more wallets, like Trezor** More ways to use the dApps, good news.

•	**Zilliqa potential Blockchain to move on, if ETH doesn’t scale** Interesting, but Zilliqa has to prove itself, I do believe we will stay in ETH for the foreseeable future though.


•	**New documentation will be added to expand the cryptocurrencies offered** Great, I Think the next batch of coins should include BCH and LTC. For Erc-20 I’m  interested in BAT and 0x.

•	**Works on Technical and in depth content to be released** This is great to gain big players that will want to know how things work. Also great for community members that are looking to implement Request solutions on their own project or propose them to their companies or friends.


•	**Fiat moved to a med-long term goal** Fiat is coming, what everyone has to understand that no one has managed to deal with it yet because there is a war from banks and countries against crypto, not even Binance has managed to do it. The regulations aren’t there yet. Don’t get me wrong I’m still disappointed Fiat is not a thing, but we have to understand if this is a team problem or a markets problem. And to be honest I’m not seeing banks and countries jumping to help projects integrate fiat, in fact all I see is them making it harder.

With all this being said, I believe the first Fiat integration will go for B2B and later on B2C, why? B2B is easier to implement. And will also create more volume than B2C.

•	**Over 600 job applications in 10 days, 30 interviews set for the coming 4 weeks** Bullish, there is a lot of interest in the project. This is progress.

•	**New partnerships** Great to see that more non-crypto partnerships are in the work, I still want to see crypto ones though. 

•	**Government outreach** If they manage to get 1 government it will work as a pilot and show the rest of the world the power of Blockchain and Request.

•	**Less than10 teams signed NDA to develop on top of Request** Not bad for being on mainnet less than 2 months.

•	**Around 40 teams in conversation to develop on top of Request** Bullish to see the platform getting developer demand, the developers made ETH today, and I believe they will make the REQ of tomorrow.

Would love to create some discussion here, so please feel free to chime in.

Is the process that everyone is using still USD-&gt;ETH-&gt;REQ.

Or do we have a mechanism for going straight from USD to REQ. It would be nice to have the Fiat gateway setup so that I could basically just Request myself, but that's for another post.

A: There was already plans for this from the team or any of the foundation developers

B: If not, see peoples' thoughts on the matter.

The WooCommerce plugin was updated earlier this week so you can now accept payments in ERC20 tokens (REQ, OMG, KNC, DAI and DGX)

**How do I update?**

If you don't have the plugin installed, you can view the getting started guide here: https://wooreq.com/getting-started/.

If you already have the plugin installed, in your admin panel, head to the plugins section. In there you will see an update for 'WooCommerce Request Network' Version 0.1.4. Click 'Update Now' and your done. Make sure to select which currencies you want to accept via the settings panel.

The Shopify plugin has also been updated so you can accept payments in ERC20 tokens (REQ, OMG, KNC, DAI and DGX)

**How do I update?**

If you want to accept all ERC20's (REQ, OMG, KNC, DAI and DGX) you don't need to do anything, if you go to your store it will be running the latest version. If you want to limit what ERC20's your store accepts, please go through the https://install.reqify.io wizard again.

This is my understanding on how the token will function:

* Request required for making transactions on the network. After a transaction is made, a small portion of the fees are burned.

* Staking after Ethereum launches plasma.

My question is why even require the tokens for making transactions? Isn't this going to add friction to the process? 

Would it not be better to use the token purely for staking, similar to Omisego to prevent adding friction for p2p transactions?

•	Litecoin (LTC)

•	Bitcoin Cash (BCH)

•	Monero (XMR)

•	Dash (DASH)

The ones I would give priority is LTC and BCH, because their communities actually want to spend their coins and are looking for ways to do it. Same can be said about XMR and DASH but they don’t move as much capital.

### Platform Coins

•	EOS (EOS)

•	Stellar (XLM)

•	NEO (NEO) 

•	VeChain (VEN)

•	ICON (ICX)

Each has huge communities behind them, and could be a great integration especially for the crowdfunding dApp, so they can run their ICOs using Request. I would encourage marketing the fund to this communities to grab some devs attention and apply for the integration.

### ERC-20 Tokens

•	Basic Attention Token (BAT)

•	Binance Coin (BNB)

•	0x (ZRX)

•	WAX (WAX)

•	Gifto (GTO)

•	Enjin Coin (ENJ)

ERC-20 should be the easiest of them all, and we should add tokens that serve a utility and actually are needed for spending. Personally the one I want is BAT, just because they are doing a huge marketing campaign and a lot of people will end up with BAT and we can offer them a way to spend them.

What are your personal picks? What coins I’m missing that you think should be added? (I didn’t include IOTA and NANO given the complex integration).

### Community mentions

•	Dogecoin (DOGE)

•	Ripple (XRP)

•	Tether (USDT)

•	Pivx (PIVX)

•	NavCoin (NAV)

•	Big Boobs Coin (BBC) 

•	Komodo (KMD)

I like others invested in the technology and the use-case. 

Recently the price of REQ hasn't shown recovery like other performers in the market has. REQ was meme'd and shilled to death during the great bull run of December-January and hasn't recovered since. The present price is a little concerning for many that bought high and have held through but there is a light at the end of the tunnel. 

The Request Network fund for incentivizing building on the platform is one of the biggest things this project sets itself from others. What other projects do you know have a fund for building on the platform? The 5-year span for this fund implies that the team is betting on the long game, and anyone holding this token should do the same. 

The team have experience building, come from a wide range of backgrounds and has been growing, adding new members (hiring page and blog posts show this) even in this bear market. The Request Network Foundation is getting bigger and bigger and yet people are getting more and more bearish and pessimistic of the project, the reason for this is the price but the general reason for this is that we are in a bear market. The team is one of the most professional in crypto, extremely communicative, we are spoiled with the bi-weekly blog posts. Conversely, this leaves less room for speculation and more buying the rumour selling the news volume pumps but if crypto/blockchain is to be a viable technology for the future, pure speculation won't last, trust in a team that can deliver a product. 

Let's all be happy we are here to witness some game-changing technology and resources that The Request Network team is creating. The future is a bumpy road, so hold onto your bags.

Request Great Wall: Q1 2018
-First version of Request working with Ethereum on Main Net
-Deploy management of Crypto-currencies on Request (ERC20 tokens)
-Proof of concept : Request Core working with a Bitcoin Oracle
-Work on partnerships with Accounting, Payment and Audit firms
-Launch the Pay with Request project: an online button which offers an alternative to the traditional Pay with Paypal and Pay with credit card
-Outside audits of the Request Contracts

Request Stonehenge: Q2 2018
-POC of Scaling Request through a Plasma chain with PoS. Request will have to handle a heavy load of transactions
-POC of Increased Request Privacy using ZkSnarks20
-Add management of Fiat-currencies to Request (USD, EUR, CNY)
-Launch the Request and Transparency project. We will work with city halls, associations and governments to publish real time information on their budget
-Organize discussion groups around Payment Requests with institutions such as Worldbank/IMF/ECB and the UN

Request Colosseum : Q3 2018
-Deploy the Escrow extension to allow the release of funds upon delivery or upon satisfaction of other con- ditions
-Deploy the Tax extension to automatically pay taxes in real time
-Deploy the Down Payment extension to specify an amount to pay and a specific date on which to process it -Deploy the Late Fees extension to specify penalties if a Business is not paid on time
-Add a Reputation Offchain layer

Request Petra : Q4 2018 and after
-Deploy the governance system (Vote/Token Chat)
-Launch the ”Internet of Things framework” project
-Deploy Inter-currency settlement through REQ to facilitate international payments
-Launch the Continuous Payment extension which will act as a Down payment with an infinity of micro payments

None of the things from Q2 panned out, we still don’t really have BTC, and I’m not sure there was ever an explanation. 

Was it just too much to tackle? Did they not have enough people working on it to get it done? Did they not have people with the right skills? While not ideal, these would be acceptable to me because at least we know they have enough money lying around to bring another dozen people in. 

Or was it that they committed things that aren’t even possible? If so, did they know they wouldn’t be possible but still committed? Or did they commit without knowing these things were possible in practice? 

I’m not so worried about advertising like this sub seems to be, I’d much, much prefer there’s something solid that grows organically. Even if you advertised right now it’s not like there’s much there that is useful or helpful or solves problems people are having. If you had something with dozens of coins, swaps, low fees, high throughput, and allows you to do whatever it is better than competitors, I’d feel good about advertising it. 

Maybe I’m naive but I don’t actually feel that advertising is particularly hard, the hard part is building something people want to use, and to me that looks like the huge hurdle we need to leap before we start getting really hard up on them for not advertising enough.

Current crowdfunding platforms could easily be supplanted by Request for a few basic reasons, in my opinion:

1. Multiple currency donation options
2. WAY lower fees, especially for people looking to make small donations
3. Transparency, we can see exactly where funds go after a donation/crowdfunding campaign has ended
4. Censorship resistance, anyone can run a campaign to raise funds and not have it taken down for whatever reason

The problems or drawbacks of a decentralized system are pretty much fraud and being unable to undo the fraud, should it occur. How can we mitigate the drawbacks? We have a huge opportunity to take a huge chunk out of this market, but people are cautious with their money and need to know it's going to who they believe it's going to. I don't want to see this become a thing that only scammers are using.

Also, what are some problems with the current crowdfunding platforms that an application built on Request could handle differently?

How can we make this accessible to people that know nothing about cryptocurrencies? I think there could be some sort of about section or something explaining that you can receive whatever currency you like (when this feature is out of course), how to receive stable currencies (and what stable currencies are) if you don't want to deal with volatility, how to move your cryptos around, how transactions in crypto can't be undone so you need to be careful when sending them etc.

In case you think I'm being delusional, here are the fee structures for some of the most popular crowdfunding sites:

I am big fan of both the Request Network project and the Ocean Cleanup project.

Let me shortly introduce **The Ocean Cleanup**.

&amp;nbsp;

Large plastic waste turns into microplastics which slowly accumulate in both humans and animals. Removing plastic from the sea will prevent the formation of microplastics and thus safe marine life and prevent plastics getting into our food.

From their website:

""The Ocean Cleanup is a non-profit organization, developing advanced technologies to rid the world’s oceans of plastic.

By utilizing the ocean currents to our advantage, our passive drifting systems are estimated to clean up half the  Great Pacific Garbage Patch in 5 years’ time"". Visit there website for more information and videos about the project:

[https://www.theoceancleanup.com/](https://www.theoceancleanup.com/)

&amp;nbsp;

The Ocean Cleanup is looking for donations to fund this amazing project. On there website they are already accepting cryptocurrencies, so I think the donation platform from Request Network is a perfect match and a win-win situation for both projects.

&amp;nbsp;

I am working for a company that is working together with this project thus I able to get in contact with The Ocean Cleanup relatively easy. What do you guys think of the colaboration of the donation platform and the Ocean Cleanup?

If there is enough support I will contact them next week. Cheers!",NA,"92ly82",NA,0,NA,"false",1536674761,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","false","linkflairlabel","","false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/92ly82/cryptocurrency_donations_for_the_ocean_cleanup/",NA,"","false","Use Case","",0,1

I wanted to repost this as I finally heard back from Shelly, owner of Shelly's Angels Saving Strays (SASS). She has contacted the admins directly and both acknowledged and verified the validity of this fundraiser in which 100&amp;#37; of ETH raised will go directly to her non-profit, no-kill volunteer dog rescue! Shelly and everyone at SASS are eternally grateful for even the smallest donations that help keep SASS doing the great work they do each and every day. She wanted me to mention that they don't only rescue pups, but also kittens and cats as well! I know this is a tough time in the crypto markets, but please consider helping out this worthy cause as well as assisting in the beta testing of Request's awesome crowdfunding site!

Please note that the admins will be leaving a comment with their confirmation!

I am worried competition will come and take a huge market share from Request Network and do so fairly easily. The following is a list of concerns I currently have for the team and community. I would appreciate it ""*if""* this gets enough up votes that an actual team member addresses these concerns.

# 

# Roadmap:

The first major concern is the roadmap. In my opinion, this is one of the main reason the price is suffering. The road map has changed since the whitepaper. Understandably, things change but the new “dynamic” roadmap is inexcusable. The roadmap doesn’t show progress, too generic to grab investors’ attention, and hard to tell what the team is really working/focused on. Sure it shows what the team is working on, but where are all those promised items in the whitepaper? I keep hearing that on-boarding PwC took time. But that does not excuse the multiple missed objectives from the whitepaper. The following is the original roadmap:

**Request Colossus: Q4 2017**

\-*Token Launch*

*-First version of Request working with Ethereum on Test Net*

*-Deploy the website to Create/Visualize and interact with Requests*

*-Add Request management of accounting concepts such as refund, credit note and purchase orders*

*-Release the API to create/read/update Requests*

*-Release technical papers about architecture, upgrades and accounting implementation*

**Request Great Wall: Q1 2018**

\-*First version of Request working with Ethereum on Main Net*

*-Deploy management of Crypto-currencies on Request (ERC20 tokens)*

*-Proof of concept: Request Core working with a Bitcoin Oracle*

*-Work on partnerships with Accounting, Payment and Audit firms*

*-Launch the Pay with Request project: an online button which offers an alternative to the traditional Pay with PayPal and Pay with credit card*

*-Outside audits of the Request Contracts*

**Request Stonehenge: Q2 2018**

*-POC of Scaling Request through a Plasma chain with PoS. Request will have to handle a heavy load of transactions*

*-POC of Increased Request Privacy using ZkSnarks20*

*-Add management of Fiat-currencies to Request (USD, EUR, CNY)*

*-Launch the Request and Transparency project. We will work with city halls, associations and government to publish real time information on their budget*

*-Organize discussion groups around Payment Requests with institutions such as World bank/IMF/ECB and the UN*

**Request Colosseum: Q3 2018**

\-*Deploy the Escrow extension to allow the release of funds upon delivery or upon satisfaction of other conditions*

*-Deploy the Tax extension to automatically pay taxes in real time*

*-Deploy the Down Payment extension to specify an amount to pay and a specific date on which to process it*

*-Deploy the Late Fees extension to specify penalties if a Business is not paid on time*

*-Add a Reputation Offchain layer* 

**Request Petra: Q4 2018 and after** 

*-Deploy the governance system (Vote/Token Chat)* 

*-Launch the “Internet of Things framework” project* 

*-Deploy Inter-currency settlement through REQ to facilitate international payments* 

*-Launch the Continuous Payment extension which will act as a Down payment with an infinity of micro payments*

According to the whitepaper roadmap it looks like the team over-promised and under delivered. What would any rational person call this? Would they say we got duped to give them our ICO money? The team is under-performing? Did the team over-promise us just to get the funding they need? I don't know how to feel about this, but the least I expect is an explanation for all the missed items on the whitepaper. Line by line I'd like an explanation. Simply stating, “We are moving to a dynamic roadmap to be flexible in the fast changing crypto world,” isn't enough. What did the team do if they didn't do what was promised? At the very least, the team can provide an explanation after taking 33.6 million dollars from investors with a promise that fell short. Yes, I understand it’s harder than it looks, but why promise it in the first place? And it’s okay to fall short, but we still need an explanation....item by item. And I don't want to hear the team doesn't owe us anything. Yes they do, we trusted them and gave them our money based on the whitepaper.

If there is something the team is working on that they cannot discuss that's fine, but there are ways around this. They can simply say we are currently working on an item that can't be discuss, more news to come in the future. Right now what I see is an overpromised and under delivered project. The team realized that the new dynamic roadmap was not well received by the community, so they said they will update the road map with progress bars…still waiting... and they need to add a lot more than just progress bars. They need to regain confidence in the community.

# Marketing:

Marketing is the second major concern and another reason the price is suffering. I cannot stress enough how important this is. When I tell an outsider about Request Network they are usually really interested. However, if I don't tell them or another member of the community does, then they won’t know. It is not my job or the community’s job to be doing this. Marketing doesn’t have to be expensive. All it takes is a simple active social media account. Hire an intern to do it. Shoot I bet members from the community would do that for free, not that they should. I understand the team doesn’t want to put a face on the project because it’s decentralized. However, currently we have nothing. ETH is decentralized, but Vitalik is very involved in the public eye. He has videos and presentations out there talking and explaining ETH. Request Network has nothing. Not a single video of a team member explaining Request Network on a grand scale. It’s unrealistic to expect everybody to read and understand the whitepaper without further clarifying the objectives of the project. Explain to investors and the average Joe that Request Network is more than a click to pay with crypto button. A video would do wonders.

We have an old and outdated website after being promised a new one in the AMA. I don’t want to hear it’s on the way. It’s either here or not. You claim crypto is fast paced and changing to justify the dynamic roadmap, yet everything you do is at a sloths pace. This new website is starting to sound like a false promise, just like the original roadmap. ""Ohh boy we got all this amazing stuff coming"" a year later and a lot is missing. Are we going to be waiting a full year for the new website...Come on fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me... 

Additionally, I don’t want to hear the team is involved with the community. They post once every two weeks. Each update is less and less informative. I want to see engagement. I want to see YouTube videos, I want to see live AMA, I want to see activity. Right now it’s like the team is hidden in a cave and we don’t know what they are doing. I want to see the team with a smile on and confidently say for example “Fiat is coming! However, these are the issues we are facing now.” I don’t want them to hide behind a keyboard anymore.

When Apple releases a new phone, do they wait till the new phone/laptop/iPad/etc. are done to market it? I don’t want to hear, “We aren’t Apple.” We should aim to be a top company, hence, use top company marketing strategies. It’s not the community’s job to spread the word about Request. Shoot didn’t know Apple expected me to go out and market their product when I bought their stock. There are some unrealistic expectations going on. Investors gave money to the team to develop the product and that includes marketing. And I don’t want to hear the team is planning to market soon, because we are already late. And what I’m asking for can be done right now, without much cost. Making a video won’t take money away from developing… 

# Dapps:

Can anybody point me to a list of Dapps on the network? Nope because there isn't one...

I understand developers don’t need approval to build on network, but the team needs to keep track of this and publicize it. It will help with adoptions when people see all the capabilities. No hype around Dapps. Chango reddit has 15 subscribers. Let me repeat that, 15 subscribers. How will we get adoptions with no awareness? We live in an age of social media. How will people know about Request Network if they aren’t active on social media? And I’m not saying post a bunch of hype crap, just do something like post on Twitter about the Dapps. For example, “Chango app is now in the beta phase! Chango is a payment app similar Venmo. Link for more info”

# Price:

We are under ICO price which is inexcusable even in a bear market, but price is a reflection of market perception of the project. Yes, there may be some irrational pricing, but not to this extent. Currently, the price justifies how the team has been performing, plain and simple. If it was valued more the market would value it more. REQ lost 95&amp;#37; in value from ATH. Don’t want to hear that most coins lost this much. Most coins will go to zero. So are we in the crapcoins category now? We lost 60-70 places on the market cap rankings. Clearly that means we are being out performed. And I don’t want to hear there are new coins that pushed us down. That would be a fair thing to say if we dropped a few spots, but interest and volume stayed decent. We claim to be a top coin but all indications are we are just an “average joe” coin.

I don’t want to hear the team doesn’t care about price. They took money from investors, it’s their responsibility to perform. The team owns 15&amp;#37; of the coins, so they should care. I don’t want to hear ""then sell if you aren’t happy"". I can voice my opinion. Most jobs have performance appraisals. This is my view of the current situation. If I’m wrong then it’ll show in the votes and comments. If people feel the same way it’ll show too. I’m tired of this constant “You’re FUDing because you don’t kiss the floor the team walks on” mentality. If you can’t take criticism then this is not the space for you. If I was FUDing I wouldn’t take the time to give an in depth analysis of what my concerns are. I don’t want to hear, “It has only been a few months and this is a long term project.” Yes, this is a long term project; however, each step along the way matters and we have missed a few steps already. I have real concerns and want real answers. I wouldn't be asking the team to respond. Sometimes the team needs a wakeup call. There is always room for improvements. And the items I'm asking for shouldn't take that long to fix/address; however, they should have a huge positive impact on the sentiment around this project.

2. It'll create so much flow and transactions because of how many donations and subscribers there are on a daily basis. 

3. It'll ultimately lower the fees on each transaction and create such a high volume coin.

I released an alpha version of a Python library for Request Network. It is partially working, but far from complete - this is an early release to get some feedback and suggestions.

This is not ready for use with real funds or in a production app. I have only tested the happy path for many functions, and skipped a lot of validation checks.

I’m currently doing the first pass to get the main functions working with Ethereum-denominated Requests. After that I will add a proper test suite, and then add support for Bitcoin and ERC20 tokens.

Currently it is possible to:

* create a Request as payer or payee
* create a Signed Request as the payee
* broadcast a Signed Request as the payer
* get a Request by its ID or transaction hash

QR codes can be generated from Signed Requests - anyone scanning the code will be taken to the Request Payments page, where they can accept and pay the Request.

Code: https://github.com/mikery/python-request-network 

Docs: https://python-request-network.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

I am also building a Django library to make it easier for web developers to integrate Request payments/donations. There is a very simple demo [here](https://django-request-network.herokuapp.com/) (connected to the Rinkeby test net). The demo displays a list of products. If you click on the product page you will see a button and QR code which can be used to ""buy"" the product. I didn't build an actual shop, so if you complete the transaction don't expect to receive anything other than my thanks for your willingness to be a beta tester :-)

"1004956",1532607185,"RequestNetwork","claussph","self.RequestNetwork","https://www.reddit.com/r/RequestNetwork/comments/921pt2/sentiment_and_expectations/",38,211,NA,NA,"Sentiment and Expectations","I’ve been rather quietly following this subreddit, telegram and now the new discord channel and I’m somewhat upset and frustrated by the sentiment around this project. Here are my thoughts:  

Some of the expectations I have seen around here are horrific at times and it seems that many invested in this project have never been involved with software developing or a job in a startup. Just for example, I am involved in a company that built it’s idea and software platform for almost 1.5 years before spending a dime on marketing or signing a client. Now they are planning an IPO by 2021, which is about 9-10 years after starting.   

I really urge you to be realistic and please ask yourself what you achieve personally in your job, your team or company within a time frame of two weeks, a month, a quarter and half a year? Do you close deals or partnerships with major corporations every week in your sales department or does it take a few months if not a year to close them (depends on the product and sales cycle of course)? Then ask yourself if you have a market ready product that you work with and are able to sell if you’re in a sales position. The crypto space is still so new, vague and full of uncertainty in regards to regulations that companies don’t come running into your door to sign the contract.  

Developing a working and flawless piece of software takes time and always has unforeseen roadblocks and hiccups. Imagine this: a customer uses Reqify to purchase something off a Shopify site and  the funds disappear. Will he ever use it again? Unless he’s an active user here on reddit and is willing to provide feedback, he’s likely to never touch it again. Chances are he’ll tell all his friends what a shit service this is. It’s vital that things work before launching them. It’s good that there’s lots of testing - even if it means we need to wait a month or two before it’s working. If you market it too early it can kill a product and it’s money thrown out of the window. In case you wonder, I prefer Mozzarella balls being eaten in Singapore for team building purposes rather than spending thousands on marketing something that’s not there yet.  

I hear the outcry for marketing for months. What are they going to pay marketing for? For REQ to increase in value and us token holders to be happy? For products that aren’t finished or in beta? What’s your understanding of business? It doesn’t make sense to market REQ if there is nothing to market. Let a few dApps be in production, which might even work together, and then blast the word out there. I’d want to integrate the woocommerce plugin, but I don’t feel comfortable until I have an accounting solution integrated. Maybe Gilded and Woocommerce will solve this soon?  

I’m sure there are marketing expenses and activity in regards to B2B that we don’t have insights to. Again, be realistic. Once BTC is integrated I‘m sure we can see more marketing towards the WooCommerce and Reqify plugins as BTC is clearly the market leader. The other dApps will follow - when they are ready to market.  

REQ got it hard. Harder than other tokens, but overall the market has developed very poorly until recently. The overreaction on the update(s) was frustrating and mirrors the market frustration of people loosing money.  I feel for you if your buying price is at 0.3 USD or even 0.9 USD, but ask yourself if you made a responsible trade when you entered. Or did you buy into a massive Fomo of a three month old project in December without a working product? Don’t expect a partnership or huge leap in software production every two weeks, not even every two months.   

Yes, I agree that the last update backfired and I’m sure the feedback came unexpected for the team, but if the price would be higher non of us would have cared about Dinner images and pictures of monkeys. Probably we would have applauded them at 0.3 USD., but do you honestly think they didn’t do anything while meeting in Singapore? For gods sake. If you’re on a business trip of course you’ll go to dinner with your counterparts or colleagues. Do any of you travel for work? I guess it was unsensible to post them in the update at current price levels and it caused an outburst of criticism.  

One more thing. If you invest into a startup, or in this case a foundation with a token structure, be prepared to loose all money or don’t invest. 90% of startups fail. Will REQ be one of them? Time will tell, but from what I’m seeing currently I don’t think it will. I’m ready for downvotes, but I had to put this out there.",NA,"921pt2",NA,1,NA,"false",1536665198,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","false","linkflairlabel","","false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/921pt2/sentiment_and_expectations/",NA,"","false","Discussion","",0,1

I told them that integrating the Request Network into their site would help them activate a passionate group of crypto currency enthusiasts who were looking to make charitable donations in their perferred curency without having to see their crypto and pay capital gains taxes 

I also told them that integrating the Request Network and the Donaid App would help them reduce their transaction fees because they currently only accept credit cards on their website which is costing them 2-5% per transaction

I'm out here doing my part trying to build enthusiasm about the Request Network and encourage crypto currency adoption even though my personal invest in request isn't doing so hot. I truly believe it is the future

The executives at Riley and the Kelley faculty at Indiana University started off skeptical but I really think that I was able change some minds during my presentation.

We thought it is a good idea to update everyone on some of the discussions and planning we’ve been doing while [meeting](https://imgur.com/jo8igyr) with the team in Singapore. 

As a group, we had very productive discussions today about the future brand of Request, the short and long-term goals as well as the current state of the community. We have also discussed all the feedback which you have given us over the past few months. We took a look at the upcoming overhaul of the Request brand, identified areas which can be improved as well as areas that are already functioning well, in order to improve the experience for the whole community. Below are some of the areas we covered.

&amp;nbsp;


**Request Network Branding**      

The main focus for today was to deeply understand Request branding and to understand the scope, reasons and benefits of the rebrand. There are three layers to this project; (re)branding, digital platform creation and content creation. Each of these layers are aimed to be completed by the end of the year. The team are working with a global industry leading full-service agency on the full project. It is a significant project which will provide an essential number of long-term benefits for the team, partners, community and builders/developers. Visually updating the roadmap will be part of this project, following the same timeline. 

During today's session we learned the difference between branding and marketing. While branding is more about communication and actions throughout all departments of an organisation defining a brand, marketing specifically is using tools to gain market adoption of a product or service. We’ve gained an understanding of how marketing is planned when it comes to the protocol and the applications. The marketing of the protocol is aimed towards attracting developers and builders. This is the main focus once the brand overhaul has been completed. Applications built on top of the protocol will have different marketing strategies based on the target market.

&amp;nbsp;

**ELI5 Request**

As a lot has changed within Request during the last year, it’s hard for businesses and developers to understand what Request is, how it functions and how it could benefit them. The team have decided that alongside the new brand they are creating easily digestible content to educate visitors. Another goal of this content is to attract developers by making it easy to understand why they should build on Request. A brand guide will be created for external developers.

&amp;nbsp;

**Community**

We feel that right now there is a slight gap in the community communication platforms. We have the Subreddit which has been serving as a great place for in-depth discussion, the Telegram channel as a good area for active discussions and private the ICO slack which houses quite a few ICO investors.  

  

After discussion we believe that the best solution to tackle these issues is to open a Discord community channel, bringing together the Telegram and Slack communities. We have seen quite a few teams transition from Slack &amp; Telegram into Discord as it helps significantly with structured discussions. We are going to test this as the main community channel to bring both the moderators and the foundation team closer and more engaged with the community. We’ll discuss the rollout of this transition further, later in the week, and monitor/adjust after.

&amp;nbsp;

**Relationship Team and Community**

We have noticed that there has been increased feedback about the personal relationship between the foundation team and the community. We’re looking to find ways for the team to interact with the community, without distracting them too much from project progression. The move to Discord is the first step to make this easier.

We are keen to allow open discussion and are opposed to censorship, as such, community discussions will always be open - with both positive and constructive comments being appreciated. As has always been the case, insulting others and spamming will be moderated. There will be further discussions over the coming days, but we welcome your feedback in the meantime as we can achieve more with the help of community feedback.

&amp;nbsp;

**FAQ**

We are improving the FAQ and will host it in a more appropriate place to serve as a source for any information for existing and potential community members. We welcome suggestions from the community for FAQs and are working on this during the week.

**Adam (admREQ)** 


&amp;nbsp;

It was an absolute pleasure spending a week with the mods and the Request team - I thoroughly enjoyed spending time with passionate like-minded individuals in the blockchain space. The work environment was great, the team were all extremely talented, very focused and hard working. 

The developers have a great workflow with industry standards tools to manage projects in a very organised way. With a growing team it’s great to see how they work together in such a fluid way with the skillsets of each member complimenting each other really well, the developers all have a really good relationship and it’s great to see them all working towards the same common goal.

Everything at Request is designed to create a long term groundbreaking platform with a self-sustaining ecosystem, the puzzle is already being put together with the rebrand, hiring of more developers, dApps, the Request Hub, partnerships and much more - it was an eye-opening experience for me to really see the scope of Request in action and the steps they are making to disrupt different industries. 

After spending many months working with the devs and even more time working with them closely in Singapore I was pleased to see how well organised and focussed the team was. There are a lot of exciting things going on behind the scenes which require the team to be flexible with how they work. The blockchain ecosystem is growing at an exceptionally fast rate with non-crypto companies looking to adopt blockchain technologies over the next few years, having the team in a position where they can quickly pivot to work with these companies and  deliver quality products from them will benefit the ecosystem much more in the long term. They have positioned themselves very well in this regard. 

I am very thankful to the Request team to inviting the mods out to Singapore, the experience was extremely beneficial for us all - we will continue to work closely with the team to improve communication and the interaction between the team and the community. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


I agree completely with Adam and think that goes for all of us actually. It was extremely useful to get a better grasp of the scope of everything that Request is and plans to be. 

I was very excited to go to Singapore and meet the other mods and the Request team members. It’s been a week, I think, that brought us all a bit closer to each other. And with the system and tools we set up together, I’m certain we’ll manage to bridge the perceived gap between the the community and the Request team. 

Besides the time we spent with the team at the office, we also spent a lot of time together as mods. Besides discussing about Request, community management and blockchain in general, which we did a lot, we visited some great places in Singapore such as the Gardens by the Bay and MacRitchie Reservoir. Unsurprisingly, I loved the monkeys. I like them even more in spacesuits, but it can’t all be perfect I guess.  
We also took a dive into virtual reality and killed off zombies together at Zero Latency Singapore, which was an amazing experience. We recommend everyone to try it out if you ever get the chance. Thanks for being great, fellow mods! It was nice to see we all got along very well and had lots of fun in Singapore.

I’d also like to take this chance to emphasize on of the keywords and main goals for Request that we should all be aware of: education. An example given by Brice might make this more clear. Brice told us that the team sometimes has meetings with people and organizations in which the opposite party is awkwardly surprised that Request is not there to sell a product, but is actually there to educate the public and organizations about the benefits of the blockchain in general, and Request specifically. This is something I really want to pass on to all readers of this article, as there is still so much to learn and teach as blockchain, and Request specifically, keeps on developing. 

I’d like to thank the Request team for inviting us to Singapore. It’s been a fantastic and most informative experience, which we will use to better inform the community about Request and to better relay feedback to the team. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

I feel very lucky to have been given the opportunity to meet fellow mods and the team to spend a week learning more about Request. It has been a great experience and insight into the company culture of Request as well as the vision of the project. What stood out to me about this week is how open the team were to feedback. They are very aware of the greater community but unfortunately do not have the time and resources to respond to every single query. Fortunately this week has allowed us to plan more effective methods of relaying feedback and communicating, hopefully improving the experience for the community.

I am more positive than ever about the project. It was great to put faces to names and understand the direction the project is going. Just because there’s a few weeks here and there where there isn’t much information to divulge, doesn’t mean there’s nothing going on. I can say for sure there’s a lot going on, the team are dedicated and the vision is BIG.

I look forward to, hopefully, meeting the team and mods again in the future.

&amp;nbsp;

Oh, it seems I’m the only one without a real name. Awkward. Singapore was a great experience which really allowed us to see how Request work as a team and what their goals are for the future. It was apparent to me that the team are skilled and focused, with long term goals taking precedence over short. To paraphrase Chris L when responding to a comment I made about another, unrelated, project - “They see tomorrow, we see years from now.”

Unsurprisingly I am positive on Request as a project, but after meeting with the team and attending these meetings, it is clear that their ideas for the scope of Request are much larger than I anticipated. It will be exciting to see what comes in future as the project grows and the benefits of building strong partnerships now begin to pay off. Personally, I have came back from Singapore feeling more positive on the project, and believe the other mods to share these feelings.

I enjoyed meeting the other mods, who are surprisingly not serial killers. Aside from our meetings we had the opportunity to build our own relationships, which will enable us to work better as a team. I’d like to thank the team for inviting us to Singapore, it was a pleasure to meet them and the other mods and I’d hope there are opportunities in future to do so again.

I for myself believe in the project - I'm hodling since ICO. I even didn't sell on $1 (which was probably a mistake).

Now I see a disturbing situation here - and it's not about token price.

Many people here in this sub say - ""we should have a BIG project before starting marketing campaign, ""pay now"" button is not enough""... And the team probably thinks the same way - hiring new devs and putting all efforts in making project closer to the final state.

Well, I'm not so certain about this. The situation clearly reminds me of what I call for myself ""russian startup mistake"". Why ""russian""? Because it's most common in that part of world.

You see, not all russians are scammers. Some of them are brilliant minds with a pure passion for what they do. Let's imagine that such russians see that all the... I don't know... for example tomatoes in the local store are rotten, tasteless and overpriced. ""A-ha!"" - says the russian - ""We'll be tomato kings"".

After two years of engineering, hard work and sleepless nights, the startup starts to work. Hydroponic factory in an old garage that is powered by self-made nuclear device capable of powering the entire city (by-product according to roadmap) produces tons of fresh, delicate flavored and cheap as dirt tomatoes.

But nobody gives a shit! Why?

You see, 70 years of socialistic society are 70 years. Our tomato kings truly believe that the good product should advertise itself - or doesn't need advertising which is the same. They don't put hope in empty words and ads, the term ""product recognition"" doesn't ring a bell to them and the need to pay supermarkets for placing their product on shelves just insults them. They don't even bother to find out that in one single shop that put their product on shelves without money buyers prefer to stick with ol' good rotten overpriced tomatoes because they just don't trust something new that is too cheap to look so great.

Meanwhile our startupers call a meeting. Investors are getting angry and something should be done very soon to start profiting.

After four hours of debate they decide to fire sales department (one person), hire three programmists (every startup should have them) and sell founder's kidney to start a pig farm, counting to feed the animals with tomatoes.

After two more years of work, bankrupcy and public humiliation they enter the local store and see that all the apples are rotten and expensive.

And the cycle continues....

\*\*\*

Well, that were emotions. I'm not professional in international marketing, but IMHO there are few things that developers could and should do right now.

1. Start promoting the pay button. SEO, google ads. If you try to google ""how to accept crypto on website"" you won't see a mention of REQ on the first page. And we need the adoption.

2&amp;3) Start explaining that the project is bigger than that. And also devs should care a little about token price and hype because people look at them when they try to estimate the project. You need articles and public discussion. If you want to make it cheap probably starting bounty campaing could do a trick but it may bee not the best option.

4) Hire some real marketing specialists. You need to do marketing and compete when you have the opportunity, not ""when the project is ready""

P.S. Some people in this sub say that adoption is community's work. I strongly disagree. Community already put the money in development, it's naive to think that it'll be also working instead of devs - because marketing is no lesser part of work than coding.",NA,"8xx4mh",NA,0,NA,"false",1536586927,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","false","linkflairlabel","","false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/8xx4mh/some_thoughts_from_marketing_angle_here/",NA,"","false","Discussion","",0,1

But I don't think its for the same the reasons as everyone else.


The current process of a layperson discovering Request is:


1. Go to a website that happens to use the ""Pay with Request"" button.

2. Not knowing what Request is or thinking ""Oh I don't have that.""

3. Paying with paypal or a credit card.

4. If they are technically inclined, they'll maybe do some reading about Request.


Pay with Request is a great tagline, but it never indicates that that means ""Pay with whatever crypto you want."" We need the marketing so that people who don't currently follow Request, understand what it is trying to accomplish. The current state of Crypto has websites saying ""We accept BTC"" or ""We accept ETH"", and now we're adding in ""We accept REQ."" Unless someone is already familiar with the project, it will appear that it's just another coin, not a coin that lets them use whatever they want.


In the late 2017 run-up a lot of people became familiar with crypto, that really don't understand crypto, that aren't on Reddit, that aren't technically inclined. Theres parents who downloaded Coinbase and bought BTC because their kid said to, and grandparents whose weird grandson gave them a paper wallet with $10 in ETH on it. If we want them to understand that they can use REQ then, then we need to market what REQ is.

Community management for Request Network is performed by a small group of community members, with the foundation providing support. While we’re happy we are performing well, we are always looking for ways to improve. As part of our ongoing efforts to do so, a number of moderators have been invited to join the Request Foundation at their HQ in Singapore for a week of workshops and meetings, where we will discuss the future of community management.

We’d like to ask the community to put forward any ideas you would like to see discussed and concerns you would like to see addressed about the community side of the project. Are you happy with our community rules and how they’re applied? Is there anything you would like to see us do that we’re not already engaged in? All ideas are welcome!

We (the moderators) are also happy to try and answer any idle thoughts you may have about the Request Foundation and present any ideas or feedback you have about the project, though we can’t guarantee there will be an opportunity to do so as our focus will be on improving community management.

What we’re not looking for are specific questions about the project, for example release dates, specifics about partnerships, and so on.

You’re welcome to post here, send a modmail, or message a particular moderator if you’d prefer to keep your question private. Myself and John (the [Telegram mods](http://t.me/REQ_Official)) will be happy to accept DMs (@johnnus + @admREQ) from Telegram users.

I’ve bought Req months ago and a week ago, my DCA is around 0.06$. I’m fine.

I’m just exhausted with whining posts from people who call themselves investors while you haven’t bought anything apart a token, you have no shares, you’re not in the foundation, you’re not a VC who gave funds to the team, you bought a token and that’s it.

You can’t complain : you don’t even work on the project (while you could in multiples ways, even unofficial ones).

You think the price of the coin reflects the value of the project ? Well, you’re surely not an investor, probably not a trader as well.

You want fiat integration, marketing, new website, etc... This is fair if... you could keep it for yourself because guess what ? The team doesn’t work for you. The team doesn’t work in order to let you sell when you decide the price is fair enough to do so. The team is working to make a good project.

Does the road have some bumps ? Yes. But do you remember that Satoshi was called by random people in order to work faster ? No, he wasn’t (or they weren’t).  Do you think that the devs behind Monero are called by « investors » to work faster ? Like, « yeah, you could make bulletproof faster because I want the price to go up ! » No, they aren’t. Because the community understands that what matters is that the tech works. 

Most of us are not devs. It shouldn’t prevent us to understand that these kind of tech take time to be made. You work on a thing with an idea in mind and it actually doesn’t the work the way you thought it would. So you have to do it differently. And it takes time.

But remember that no one forced you to buy a token, that the goal of this project is to make a working platform, not to make you richer. Stories about crypto rich people have made a lot of us think we’re entitled. We’re not. 

So show some support, try to help in a way or another (after all, this is what we call decentralization), it will only help your own goal.

Its not.. The request network is in fact handling less than 1 transaction a day. Less than 1..

Absolutely no one is using the network. No one.

&gt;!I've been tethered since 13 cents and cannot rationalize another buy-in unless this hits 1c or less. Best of luck with the project; I had high hopes and the fundamentals are still good; just no follow through and some trigger happy mods.!&lt;

&gt;!Downvote all you want. I believed in this project up until a few months ago. Has nothing to do with price action or my emotional investment in the project, the team let investors down period.!&lt;

&gt;!Ask yourself what is to stop  the team from just pivoting to a new company like they did with Moneytis to Request? Moneytis received no adoption then they ""pivoted"" to Request.

Looks like the last big commit to the request app was updating the angular version and fixing some minor bugs and then for quite a period of time there's silence.

Is there other repositories that are more active than the GitHub ones?

I'm quite invested in the Req token and think it's a great token with great potential but starting to have doubts about whether or this is still as active as it used to be. Especially with the new hires that happened over the last few months.Sure the price is going down but that's not my main concern, that's actually good if request developers are actually active, we can buy more :)",NA,"94myjp",NA,0,NA,"false",1536710102,"false","self","t5_3mxqs","false","linkflairlabel","","false","true",NA,"/r/RequestNetwork/comments/94myjp/is_that_something_to_worry_about/",NA,"","false","Question","",0,0

In the current state, to pay with BTC on request you need additional ETH for GAS and REQ fees. Whilst tech savvy users may have ETH on standby, on ledger or metamask for example, people that want to pay purely with their chosen currency on request are required to hold additional ETH to use the network. This is a major problem for adoption.

I'm seriously worried that when BTC launches REQ enthusiasts will state how great it is that you can pay with BTC on request network, then users go and try it out and are hit with the problem that they need additional ETH to even use request. By the time you've gone and bought some ETH for fees you could have just converted your non-ERC-20 token to ETH completely nullifying the point of even paying with a non-ERC-20 coin in the first place.

If I remember correctly, the team said fees could potentially be currency agnostic but as of now they are not. My main concern is that when it does go live, the wrong impression is given to those that think it's as simple as sending BTC and you're done. Unless you already have ETH, I really don't see the point in even using non-ERC-20 coins.

If it is true that BTC payments will require all customers to store some ETH on standby I personally think that they should just withhold BTC's release. I think implementing cross currency conversion with ERC-20 is a greater priority with higher customer/merchant satisfaction potential. Having BTC support sounds good on paper but I think the actual implementation as it stands is potentially counterproductive, not to mention the request team will be monitoring the BTC blockchain themselves using their own node.

To summarize, my concerns with adding BTC are:

1. Users must hold ETH, causing significant friction at the checkout for those that do not hold ETH.
2. The request team is running a centralized node to monitor the BTC blockchain, defeating the point of the decentralized network. 
3. Instead of focusing on BTC, I think decentralized ERC-20 conversion to DAI and other tokens is a greater priority.

This is just my opinion. If I have made any mistakes/errors let me know. I would like to hear your opinions.

I thought so too, so I built the Request Network Tip Bot.

It currently supports ETH and five ERC20 tokens (REQ, DAI, DGX, OMG, KNC). To use it, reply to a comment or post with:

`reqtip 0.0001 ETH`, or `reqtip 50 REQ`. The trigger syntax is `reqtip &lt;amount&gt; &lt;currency symbol&gt;`. 

When the bot sees the trigger comment it will send a private message to the tip recipient. The recipient will sign a transaction to prove ownership of their Ethereum address, and the bot will send the tip sender a link to the Request Network Payment Gateway, where they can broadcast the transaction and pay the tip.

Instead of buying fake, centralised Reddit Gold to reward comments/posts you find interesting, why not send the recipient some decentralised, on-chain gold instead? `reqtip 1 DGX`.

Currently the bot is only running in this subreddit - I plan to expand it to other interested subs after a testing period.

Comments, feedback, and suggestions are all welcome, either here or in the Request Hub Slack (@mike). Happy tipping!

** Please note: The bot will never reveal your Ethereum address to anyone but the tip sender. However, both Ethereum and Reddit are public resources so it is possible for someone to browse both and deduce links between Ethereum addresses and Reddit usernames. If this is a concern for you, consider using a throwaway address to send/receive tips. **

PS: The last community update mentioned the team spending time providing support to builders. As one of the recipients of that support I would like to thank Adam, Elliott, and Romaric for all of the assistance they gave me in helping to get this up and running. Thanks also to everyone who has helped testing the bot or providing feedback/suggestions.

I'm pretty new to the crypto space, but I've been waiting for quite a while for a good entry point and this seems to be the lowest the market will be in a while. So I've sent some funds to an exchange and was looking at some interesting coins to buy and Request Network caught my eye as a low market cap with a promising real-world use case. However, I was researching the tokenomics on this and CoinMarketCap shows that there are currently 725 million REQ in circulation, with a total supply of 999 million. The thing is that it doesn't seem to be mineable, so where do the rest of the 274 million tokens come from then?

It would be great if we could enforce more common sense rules and perhaps borrow some great posting guidelines from other well established communities.

I’ve spent some time during my flight back home to discuss in detail the experience in Singapore, what talked about, things the mods and team are working on, improvements that can be made and some other things too. *This post has also had input from the other moderators too.*

I don’t think any of the mods were massively pleased with the outcome of how we portrayed our time in Singapore during the last update and it certainly didn’t put across all the fantastic things we learnt or discussed while we were there. There was a quick turnaround with the update and with some of us were travelling and heading to other countries for various reasons it wasn’t ideal – anyway let’s begin. P.s. I apologise in advance for the lengthy post.

#Education

As most of you are aware there is a rebranding process going on for Request currently, it was really exciting to hear Robbins experience and to see the scope of the project. Request are working with an industry leading full-service digital agency to improve the understandability of Request through educational content. 

The current Request website is mainly catered towards ICO investors and hasn’t really changed much since the token sale – when visiting the site, it’s extremely difficult to understand what Request is, how it works and who can it benefit from the platform. One of the goals of the project is to revamp the website to cater for developers, businesses, users, community members, early adopters and investors.
 
The concept of the blockchain, Request, and its products is daunting for the non-technical audience. While the team know it’s important to cater for developers and other industry professionals having an easy to understand project with easy to consume information is an important step towards adoption. 

The Request Hub will also play a critical part in the growth of the Request Network. The new website will have a focus on developers and businesses and pushing them towards the hub and how they can use the funding to help create their projects. Most of you will probably be aware that the dApps + the core protocol are different projects entirely. Internally, this is also the case.

**You can see an visual image of the structure here: https://imgur.com/pXF1gEK**

The core platform team is responsible for protocol development, things like scaling solutions, data encryption, extensions, features like cross-currency etc. Whereas the dApp teams focus on creating applications built on the Request platform, crowdfunding, invoicing, payments etc. Although this isn’t new information it’s important for sections later in the write-up.

#FIAT

This is an excerpt from the 8th June AMA special project update (https://blog.request.network/request-network-project-update-june-8th-2018-ama-special-request-network-now-available-for-5da85547d933) which covers the teams thoughts on FIAT. 

&gt;Fiat integration is vital for the success of the Request Network for medium to long-term. What we focus on today is making sure the protocol has enough features and a solid developer experience to attract developers to build reliable financial tools on top of the Request Network. The foundation prioritizes its own development goals based on direct feedback coming from the developer community. We receive requests for features that are needed by developers, as their product depends on it. 

&gt;Today, the main feedback coming from the developer community is to make it easier to use the library, implementation of encryption, cross currency support and adding more cryptocurrencies. Apart from these requests, scalability of the protocol itself and developing extensions such as escrow are also prioritized as it is crucial for adoption of the protocol by developers. The above are our current priorities in development, while we in parallel are researching several fiat integration options mentioned in an update last December.

&gt;- Oracle with Chainlink
- Tokenized currencies
- Integration by partnerships with banks
- Oracle and bank APIs
- Partnership with credit card companies or processors`

All of the above bullet points are things the team are actively researching and looking into, we discussed how the Singapore government is looking at tokenizing the [Singaporean Dollar](https://www.trustnodes.com/2017/06/07/singaporean-dollar-tokenized-ethereums-blockchain-monetary-authority-singapore) and how many more governments in the future will look at taking this route, however this is a long way off.
 
A decentralised Oracle with [Chainlink](https://www.smartcontract.com/) would be ideal but it’s not ready yet.
 
Integrations by partnerships with banks / partnering with credit card companies or processors (like Stripe) is incredibly difficult (especially being decentralised) but it’s something the team will actively work on / towards. 

Oracle and bank APIs – we discussed several projects here like StellarX, OmiseGo and more – each have their own pros and cons but nothing in the space is really ready for FIAT, some options are close and the team are keeping a close eye on several projects in this space.

There are tonnes of regulatory issues surrounding FIAT and the blockchain, governments are dubious about the blockchain technology and banks are having a tough time getting involved too – even big companies like Binance, Coinbase and Circle still can’t obtain a banking license after many years of trying. The regulatory situation will change, crypto is still a young industry and it will take time for governments to catch up. 

Instead of spending time trying to achieve FIAT which wasn’t viable, their time has been spent on far more productive things such as scaling solutions, data encryption, working on various dApps, working with partners, hiring and much more. The better the platform the more impact having FIAT will have when it comes. Yes, not being able to stick to the roadmap isn’t ideal, but the team have realised there are limitations and made the best of the situation.
 
Would it have been good if the team have been more transparent about FIAT and the issues they faced? Absolutely. Detailed articles about subjects like this do take time,  and raise further questions which also take up the team’s time. We want to find a good balance going forward of keeping the team on track and keeping the community informed. We will also work with the team to improve communication for things like this (if they ever arise in the future) and how the mods can alleviate some of the time-pressure if possible. 

The team do realise the importance of FIAT, it hasn’t been forgotten and will be something the team will keep on the roadmap – in the future when FIAT is possible we will have a much more mature platform and many use cases live and ready to integrate FIAT. 

#Marketing

One of the most discussed things over the past months is marketing, this is a very important topic and it’s something that can make or break a project. 

As per the ‘Rebranding + Restructure’ section, marketing will be broken down into two different groups, dApps and the core Request platform. The marketing for each of these aspects is very different. 

So, why aren’t the team marketing right now? Quite simply – the platform just isn’t ready yet, there isn’t enough value to risk marketing at this stage. This is the same with some of the dApps, they are close, but they still aren’t quite there yet. 

In my case if we take a look at the WooCommerce + Shopify plugins, if I go ahead and run a PPC (pay-per-click) campaign before BTC is integrated, then users may leave the site and never return. In this instance I will have lost money as well as a potential customer. This is just one example but it’s the same for other dApps too. 
 
Right now, The team are making active steps towards marking when the platform and dApps are, as well as hiring dedicated marketers.

I do want to say that the team truly understand the importance of marketing, they will market the project and the dApps– it’s critical they do so. 

To break it down there are entirely separate game-plans to consider when marketing, the core platform and dApps.
 
######Core Platform (Foundation)

Marketing for the core platform will focus on; educating the community about the platform, educating developers / businesses / potential partners about the Request protocol and how it can be used by / integrated into business workflows. 

The rebrand will have a big focus on education and driving adoption of the Request Hub + Fund. In the meantime, we are discussing ways to improve the Request Hub and how we can get more developers involved at this stage, I have covered this in more detail in the ‘Request Hub’ section.

######dApps

Each dApp will in essence be its own entity (business) and will act independently of the foundation. Each dApp will have a dedicated team, individual aims and goals, potentially a custom roadmap, a proprietary marketing strategy and much more (everything you expect from a typical business).

Marketing for individual dApps will vary greatly depending on what the dApp is, some will be focussed on B2B, some B2C, some dApps might be a combination of both. 

#Hiring + strategies to find new devs

The foundation growing at a quick rate and one of the things we discussed in Singapore was hiring and strategies to find new devs. 

There are several strategies that the Request team can adopt alongside job advertisements to help entice developers, not only to the foundation but also to the Request Hub. We discussed potentially using freelancers and then hiring if they are a good fit, more engagement from the team with people that contribute to the Request Hub and how the team can help (financially via the fund + time set aside for devs), hackathons with prize incentives, speaking at developer conferences (very important). Some ways of engaging with developers do require the platform / ecosystem to be more mature but we are actively working on making these things a reality. 
Also, improving the community sentiment will also drive hype which in turn hopefully attracts more developers.

#Request Hub + Request Fund

In my opinion one of the best selling points of Request is the Request Hub + Fund. Although there is activity in the hub and some projects have receiving funding it is nowhere near as widely used as it could be. As I’ve discussed in the marketing section, the renewed website will have a big focus on pushing the Hub + Fund.

Aside from the marketing aspect I have also been speaking to teams in the Hub for a while about how the flow for funding can be improved, we have discussed the barrier to entry for the fund (MVP limitations), the turnaround time for responding to funding applications (needs to be quicker), having the team engage more with the Request Hub devs as well as actively helping them with their business needs. 

In the future I will also look at creating a suite of tutorials, and potentially workshops, for the Request Hub to help get developers up and running.   

#Bi-weekly updates

One of the hot topics since returning from Singapore has been the bi-weekly updates, we have been discussing with the team how they can be improved without taking up too much time for the team. 
There are several things which are actively being discussed:

- Have more clarity on what developers are working on
- Talking about blockers and potential problems the developers have faced, if things are delayed – why? 
- Have an insight into why certain decisions have been made e.g. FIAT, transparency goes a long way here. 
- Is it possible for there be previews of dApps or upcoming features?
- Talking about things going on behind the scenes without committing to firm dates / jeopardising anything. 
- Can the team promote the Request Hub projects more on social platforms?
- Can we talk about the Request Hub projects?
From an outsider’s perspective reading just the bi-weeklys it looks like not much is going on which couldn’t be further from the truth – it's clear there are exciting and innovative things going on behind the scenes and we want to demonstrate that as much as possible in the bi-weeklys. 

This will be an ongoing discussion with the foundation, it will take time to refine the bi-weeklys and we also need to find a happy medium that suits both the foundation and the community too.

#The Community Managers and our role

The goal as community managers is to firstly ensure that the social channels e.g. Reddit, Discord, Slack and Telegram are a good place for investors, the team and developers – we want to ensure it’s good for open discussions (both positive and negative) and a place where we can educate people about Request too. 

As community managers we want to try and stay as impartial as possible, we will help to educate when we can, we’ll shut down any false information and we’ll help alleviate any concerns where possible. We don’t want to take sides, we are simply there to be a bridge between the team and the community. 

We want the Request community to be an open place where anyone can discuss what they want, we want to see discussions about good things and bad – we don’t want Request to be a place where negativity is censored. We (the mods) are just normal guys, we love technology, we love the blockchain, we are just investors like all of you, and we want the best for the Request Network. 

We are continually improving how we and the team deliver information, but things can still be improved massively – we are already actioning some things to improve communication between the community and the team and we have plenty of other things lined up too.

#Roadmap

During the rebrand the website will rework the dynamic roadmap to something potentially similar to Ark (https://ark.io/roadmap), with percentages (or something similar) and a breakdown of each goal on the roadmap. This will help with transparency and also allow the community to track progress more easily. 

I’ll cover my perspective on the dynamic roadmap looking from a developers point of view, as a lot of people are still unsure as to why the roadmap has changed and in turn it raises lots of questions. 

From a developers point of view.

As a dev it can be incredibly difficult to hit deadlines that are more than a few weeks / over a month or two away, the further away the date the harder it is to estimate + hit deadlines. This is the case for a normal business, but as crypto is insanely fast paced and such a new industry this is even more prevalent. 

In the normal development world you typically work in weekly / bi-weekly sprints to produce features in small iterations which contributes to the overall project, at the end of each sprint you re-evaluate the previous weeks and re-adjust timings / resources if necessary – estimating deadlines months in advance is almost impossible. 

The biggest issue about committing to a firm date is that crypto adoption is moving at a fast rate, non-blockchain businesses are getting involved with cryptocurrencies and a great platform like Request is an attractive option for them. On-boarding these businesses takes money, expertise and most importantly team resources. The team is growing but for now the time spent with these partners needs to come from somewhere, and unfortunately features can sometimes get affected. 

Let's take BTC support - if the team was fully focused on BTC I would have no doubt there would have been no delay. But PwC came along, which took up development resources and, unfortunately, impacted the deadline. Long-term, having PwC onboard will have a more positive effect on the overall Request Network ecosystem. Partnerships won't wait around, Bitcoin support will. 

With these partnerships there will be a push for features they want to see. PwC for example, would be focused on the accounting so they would likely be pushing for accountancy related dApps (http://accounting.request.network/) - when the roadmap was first created the team could never predict such a huge entity like PwC would come onboard, so changing focus is sometimes required from a project. Once again, long-term this will benefit Request massively. 

From a development perspective changing the roadmap is a fantastic move in my opinion, the team never know what is around the corner and being able to quickly adapt to new opportunities, on-boarding companies are critical for the long-term viability of the network. 
As the team grow there will be more development resource available to focus on the core platform and partners which will allow the team to better predict features in the future. 
Once again, I’d like to reiterate things do need improving here, the team can be more transparent, and the roadmap can, and will, be improved. 

#Summary

The Singapore trip was fantastic, and it was an incredible experience working closely with the team and it was great to see their passion and talent while working away through the week, it’s an excellent work environment too. 

Every bit of feedback is incredibly important, please don’t hesitate to get in touch at any time to me or any of the mods, either by Reddit, Discord, Slack or Telegram. 
 
There is a lot of work ahead for the mods and the team, but rest assured we have every single one of your concerns in our scope; the community and the perception you guys have is so important to the team and the project. There are a lot of great things going on that we will continue to improve and lots of things that need changing – it won’t be something that happens overnight but something that will be continuously improving for the entirety of the project – we are dedicated to working hard and improving Request and the community every day.  

At the end of all this, actions speak louder than words, and we will take everything into consideration to help ensure Request thrives, we are already in the process of actively making changes.  

Apologies for the lengthy post but hopefully this clears some bits up and helps to put across some of the great things we saw in Singapore, if you have any other questions feel free to leave a comment or get in touch privately.

TL;DR - https://requestnetworktipbot.com/help

## Better workflow

AdmReq recommended a change to the flow - instead of asking the recipient to create a Signed Request, the bot just asks them for their Ethereum address and signs the Request on their behalf. This means tip recipients do not need MetaMask or any type of web3-enabled browser to receive tips - just the ability to reply to a Reddit direct message.

Once you have registered your address with the bot, all future tips will be sent automatically to that address. You can change your address at any time by sending the bot a `set_address 0x123` message.

90% of the issues I have seen so far are MetaMask related, so this should lead to an increase in completed tips.

## New trigger syntax

`cryptotip 1 DAI` -&gt; Send 1 DAI  
`daitip 1` -&gt; Send 1 DAI  
`cryptotip 10 REQ` -&gt; Send 10 REQ  
`reqtip 10` -&gt; Send 10 REQ  

This works for all supported currencies - `daitip`, `reqtip`, `knctip`, `omgtip`, `dgxtip`.

## Donate your tips to good causes

https://requestnetworktipbot.com/donate

If you send the bot a direct message containing `donate beneficiary_name`, all of your future tips will be sent to the charity or good cause of your choice.

Currently the only option is GiveDirectly, as they publish their Ethereum address on their website. I am in discussion with Unicef and some other charities, requesting that they publish an Ethereum address for donations so I can add them to the list of beneficiaries.

If you know of a good cause that accepts Ethereum/ERC20 donations please let me know so I can add them to the list of beneficiaries. Their donation address must be publicly visible everyone can verify that the tip went to the correct place.

As always, feedback, comments, and suggestions are all welcome.

The bot has been running for almost two weeks now, so I thought I would provide an update on the first days of operation. Posting from the bot's account for that sweet, sweet karma.

# As Used by Vitalik (TM)

I'm not going to feign nonchalance - I'm super excited that this went through! It was a strategic plan - I knew VB had donated to GiveDirectly in the past, and it was more likely he would go through with the donation if he was already familiar with the recipient, which is why I added them as the first charity. From a marketing perspective being able to say ""as used by Vitalik"" is priceless, and increases the chance of the bot being accepted and adopted by the wider Ethereum community. [Back of the net!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7gDP3vIKdU)

# Charitable Donations

I am happy to see a lot of people choosing to donate their tips to GiveDirectly. So far $23 worth of Dai and around $5 worth of ETH have been donated by Redditors. Obviously these are not huge amounts, but we are only in the first two weeks of soft-launch. 

Let's say the tip bot gets popular and sees 100x more usage (easily achievable once it is fully launched, marketed, and active on the big subs). Assuming a constant donation ratio, the bot would generate around $10k/month in donations for good causes.

# Effect on Network Usage (and Price?)

Since it was launched, the bot has been responsible for over 80% of created Requests. Or, to look at it another way, the bot led to a 500% increase in network usage.

[Here](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7bdd69ea74755019a8c53b1186208c9795e7c48225c4be153adddc701e8d6029) is a transaction where the tip was donated to GiveDirectly (0xc7464). Notice that a tiny amount of ETH was sent to the Request burner contract (0x7b3c4d9). Each tip results in some ETH being deposited to the burner contract, which is ultimately used to purchase and burn REQ. 

I'm hesitant to mention this as I do not want to take credit for something that might be entirely coincidental, but both price and volume have been up since the bot was launched. Based on comments like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/RequestNetwork/comments/9a58fn/daily_price_discussion_thread_august_25_2018/e4u48hw/), would it be crazy to attribute some of this growth to the bot? I'm not suggesting all of the growth is down to the bot - obviously /u/Hoptoitmofo talking about ramen and eggs is playing an important part too.

The majority of responses to the bot are along the lines of ""wow, this Request thing is cool, I'm going to look into it more"". If some of those people end up purchasing REQ then there is a lot of potential here. 

# Spreading Awareness

I have some plans for spreading awareness of the bot. Some of this is traditional (reaching out to crypto journalists so they write articles about the bot), some of it is more like growth hacking (revealing the plan beforehand might make it less effective, so I'll post back in a couple of weeks if it worked).

Before starting that I wanted to get two things lined up to make the story compelling: the VB interaction, because VB is a click magnet in crypto-journalism, and some charitable donations so people can see this is not just theoretical - thanks to the power of Request Network and the generosity of Redditors, there is a charity with (slightly) more resources which can be put to use helping people in the real world.

/u/jpwalton created a great [video](https://www.reddit.com/r/RequestNetwork/comments/9baws1/request_network_in_action_crypto_tip_bot/) showing how the bot works. Thanks John-Paul!

# Upcoming Features

- display the tip's fiat value in the first comment reply
- allow people to specify tips in fiat - `cryptotip $10 ETH` to send $10 worth of ETH
- allow other people to add to a tip, similar to RemindMe bot's 'Click here to be reminded too' feature
- more charities - some of the charities I have reached out to have published Ethereum addresses, so they can now be added. /u/Palmboom333 has also compiled a fantastic list of charities that accept crypto, so expect a lot more charities to be available soon
- stats/metrics page to show tip completion rate, tips by sub, total tip value, etc.

# More Subreddits

The bot is currently active in: 

- /r/RequestNetwork
- /r/MakerDAO
- /r/ethtrader
- /r/ethereum
- /r/ethdev
- /r/news
- /r/jokes
- /r/pics
- /r/hearthstone
- /r/millionairemakers
- /r/reactiongifs
- /r/worldnews
- /r/helpmefind
- /r/tipofmypenis

I have been cautious in rolling this out to new subs as doing so too quickly might result in bans, and I am still ironing out bugs. I also feel some extra trepidation because of the 'powered by Request Network' branding on the bot's comments. Some crypto subs take a harsh view of perceived spam, and the last thing I want is for people to associate Request Network with a spammy bot.

The best way to grow the bot is organically and every tip is an ad for Request Network, so if you are active in the above subs please consider adding a tip to one of your comments. If your favourite sub isn't listed, let me know and I'll add it.

/u/bricereq connected me with a mod of a very popular crypto sub which has a blanket ban on tip bots. I'm in discussions with them to see if an exception can be made. The architecture of the bot works in our favour here - most (all?) other tip bots are off-chain or hold funds in escrow for users so there is a high trust requirement. Because the bot merely facilitates transactions these concerns do not apply - there is no way for me to steal funds (unless I replace the recipient's address with my own, which will be immediately visible to all involved). I'm hoping the fact that the bot is trustless and on-chain is enough for the mods to allow it. This would be a huge driver for awareness, so let's keep our collective fingers crossed.

Thanks to those who have been using the tip bot, and for all of your positive comments and feedback - I'm ecstatic with the community response to the bot, and really appreciate all of the suggestions and kind words.

You can now buy greeting cards via Request Network at lumacards.co.uk","Hi everyone,

Perhaps something a bit more positive amongst all the bear market blues. I am happy to announce I have just launched my e-commerce store: https://www.lumacards.co.uk/

We sell a variety of high quality art based greeting cards, perfect for birthdays, personal messages and celebrations. We accept a wide variety of cryptocurrencies; ETH/DAI/REQ/OMG/DGX (Via Request Network) plus Bitcoin, Litecoin, Monero, Vertcoin and more. We ship to any location worldwide and our UK customers can enjoy free delivery on orders of 5 cards or more.

I know how frustrating it can be to find places that let you pay in a wide variety of cryptocurrencies so I'm happy to be able to provide a service that allows you to do just that and supports and promotes the usage of Request Network.

We have a Christmas card collection coming soon so if you need Christmas cards in the near future, be sure to check us out.

Special thanks to /u/AdmREQ for his development on the WooReq plugin and also his assistance in helping setting up my store.

Chango seems to be dead (no updates since the 4th of May)

Gilded haven't updated since July

Crowdfunding App is a meme at this point.

Wooreq &amp; Reqify apps - Fair play to Adm on being the most consistent and actually giving updates on the Reqify project. Here is an update from discord as of 25th of July

""We were not approved initially but the team are going to speak to Shopify and see what we can do to get approval going forward. Since the application the app has been created and is pretty very popular too. We'll exhaust every avenue if needed. It's an ongoing process and I'll continue to roll out features for both the WooCommerce + Shopify apps as they grow it'll be more likely to get approved in the future. I'm also working on another app (built on Request) which will really benefit the Shopify application when it launches. Shopify have declined to comment so all we can do is continue to improve and re-apply.

Whatever they need, me or the foundation will do anything in our power to make it happen. If they only accept centralised companies I'll form a legal entity, if they need something from a technical perspective, I'll do it. Anything they need we can do our best to make it happen - right now we haven't been given a reason so we are completely in the dark unfortunately - we'll keep working on it :thumbsup:

Me and Brice will both continue to push to be accepted. He can apply ever 30 days and we will continue to do so until we get approved / get some feedback.""

But there have been no updates since then and it still hasn't been approved?

In relation to Wooreq, that seems to be coming along well. as of the 29th of August

""Currently Ledger, Metamask and Trezor. I have a PoC which I have discussed with the team having a way to pay signedRequests directly from MEW (or whatever wallet you use). There will be massive improvements to the payment flow over the next month's though, there are things in progress""

As of 10th September, almost a year since ICO it's pretty worrying to see the lack of development on DApps and to see some developers pull out due to a lack of development on the Request Network itself.

Request was worth ~1 billion dollars at its peak. What in the world justifies that price. If you are an investor you should know to take profits when your investment is overvalued. If you don’t know how to do that then I suggest you learn before you put another dollar in the market. 

Don’t justify it by ohh “I don’t trade” “taxes” or anything along those lines. Imagine you have x asset  worth $10k and somebody offers you $200k and you say “nahhhh I’m just going to keep holding” that’s pure greed, pure stupidity, pure gambling, pure laziness to do any value research about your investment. 

Long story short, the team screwed up in some things but they also produced a lot of good things. Don’t blame anybody but yourself for buying the peak or not selling the peak. Market value now is almost 40 million, that’s not crazy for where we are progress wise. Anything higher is based on future assumptions of the network performance.

"1118386",1536859692,"RequestNetwork","claussph","self.RequestNetwork","https://www.reddit.com/r/RequestNetwork/comments/9fk05e/current_sentiment_around_req_and_the_entire_market/",14,88,NA,NA,"Current Sentiment around REQ and the entire Market","I apologize for the long post, but for some reason I only feel the urge to post on Reddit when I feel sentiment gets out of control. Well, over the passed days I feel it is out of control. REQ seems to have very emotional people invested compared to other communities that I briefly track. I've been following the discussions on Telegram and Discord and am somewhat caught up in astonishment (and disbelief) of how strongly people react to development, which we don't have that much insight to.

Don't get me wrong. I'm not a defendant of REQ to death. There were many things I believe were not handled well from a communication perspective, but by no means should that represent current sentiment. 

Now, that being said, the resulting frustration from price development doesn't mean to make somewhat horrendous accusations towards the team. Accusations which are unfunded from my point of view. The most recent anger I saw was towards the change of mind of the dApp of Transfr. I initially missed the message that they decided not to build their beta on top of REQ, but a heated discussion on Telegram caught my attention. Phrases such as 'exit scam coming, shit team, no progress, soft roadmap' and so on and so forth started. All because a potential dApp partner didn't see the requirements available for their MVP? If you've ever worked in a software company, especially in an early stage startup - which REQ 100% is - this will happen a ton of times. Why? Simply because you just started. You won't be able to have every requirement available for every customer you're in touch with. Developing software is a progress. With a growing team and ecosystem I'm sure - and very much hope - that REQ will hire a skilled product manager. This role will bridge the gap between dApps requirements and the REQ platform. For now REQ is still laying the groundwork. 

Transfr used the wording 'under-developed', which implies at first sight that the REQ platform as a whole is not there yet or 'poor' as I read on telegram. However, they also said they might look into REQ at a later stage. I really don't see the reason for the outrage that this statement caused. Yes, for their purpose something was missing, but I'm sure that REQ may work on this feature if they see value. Then they'll get back in touch with Transfr to see if they can find new grounds. For me this sounds like a perfectly normal customer acquisition process.  

It took me some time to understand the dynamics of crypto currency related companies. ICOs have a very different investment structure than a VC investment and therefore require a very different approach towards communication. With a traditional VC investment the company only needs to keep a small group of stakeholders informed, while being able to develop and sell without distractions. 

Companies raising money via an ICO on the other hand require a very distinct level of communication, as there are hundreds - if not thousands  of investors trying to hold on to every single piece of information. I'm certain, if the REQ token wouldn't exist none of the potential dApps would even be mentioned until beta testing. Although I open Reddit, Twitter and Discord every second day or so in hopes that there is positive news on REQ  I think it would be better not to disclose that the Gildeds, Changos, Transfrs and Donaids are built on top of REQ. After following the Discord channels of the dApps I don't see the community adding much value (no offense intended here!). It only causes frustration if an 'investor' sees an empty Chango channel, a drop out of Transfr or Donaid being in beta for months. I'd keep all the dApps under a NDA about the information being built on top of REQ. Once they have a market ready product or are open for beta testing one could utilize the REQ community to get feedback. I don't see the point of announcing potential dApps earlier than that. Although this would clearly mean an additional reduction in information I strongly believe it would eliminate the outrage of the community if something like Transfr or Wikimedia happens, which is perfectly normal in business. Crypto is not normal though.

On a another note, the crypto market clearly crashed in 2018 and I think it's mainly due to disappointment of implementation as a whole - and manipulation, but I won't get into that. To be honest there is not a single project/token that is being utilized in a real world situation or solving/improving a current process. There are many fantastic ideas, which can revolutionize particularly the finance sector, but all of them are being tested and are not implemented yet. I'm pretty sure we'll see integration by early/mid 2019, but until then there will be lots of uncertainty in the market. 

Let's be positive and support the team. Not everything in Github is what they're working on. Many things are private and not everything should be communicated immediately. I'm sure the team is seeing the sentiment around the project and are working hard. Let's stay critical, but be let's be realistic also. REQ is a year old and is putting together the foundation of the platform. The job offers speak for themselves that there is progress made behind the scenes. Am I worried? No. I don't like the price development either, nor do I get excited when I see delays, but not everything works out as planned - especially in software. However, blockchain is here to stay and REQ is expanding it's team regardless of market sentiment. That is always a good sign and shows they were responsible with the funds they raised to run the show for a while. 

REQ has a mainnet that can power online payments with Wooreq and Reqify, it can power a tipbot and an invoice app, it's laying the groundwork for accounting with input from PWC France. It might not seem a lot within a year for everyone, but REQ won't change the world within a year. The team is growing and hiring. I certainly was hoping for quicker expansion of the team as well, but having the fortune to have discussions with Blockchain engineers it's not a simple task to hire the right fit. There's always a chance of failure and although blockchain will very likely be part of our daily lives it still takes time to get there. All I can say is: diversify your crypto portfolio and hope you have one or two 'moon shots.' Be ready that some will drop to 0 also. Hopefully REQ will be part of a large blockchain deployment.

I'll stay critical and if I see something that is worrisome I will certainly reduce my holdings in REQ. However, I haven't seen any issues concerning me yet. So far it's all typical business processes with the difference that REQ is urged to disclose partnerships and dApp developments to feed the information hunger of a community.

Im looking for project to invest in. I run into this project and it seems almost perfect. I dont care if it doesnt work now (very little  cryptocurrencies is) but REQ has huge potencial in the future.

Only thing Im worried about is the transactions fees (of REQ). My opinion is that new age cryptocurrencies should not have any. This could be the main reason for lefting the fiat and bring mass adoption. Only my opinion. I know there is lot of hate against IOTA and NANO but I really think that because lack of fees thiese could be the future of the cryptocurrencies.

I know that 0.02 - 0.5 percent fee is not much but there is big difference between small and none. I run to this:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/RequestNetwork/comments/7t6bx8/will\_ethereum\_be\_a\_problem\_for\_req/dta819p](https://www.reddit.com/r/RequestNetwork/comments/7t6bx8/will_ethereum_be_a_problem_for_req/dta819p)

and I agree. 

So my question are:

Are devs considering to switch network to some feeless in the future?

Is it even possible?

Do you also think this is important?

p.s. Its possible that I dont understand the whole concept well. My English is not good and knowledge of tech stuff in the whitepaper even worse. Please ELI5

Wouldn’t this be a good idea if you’re building a wider ecosystem of applications on the network, to have one, easy to use wallet? And maybe some sort of option in the future where you can select what you what your funds to be transformed into before they hit your master wallet?

This could be a great tool for people accepting donations or even businesses accepting payments using Request as it allows them to hedge against volatility as much as they prefer.
