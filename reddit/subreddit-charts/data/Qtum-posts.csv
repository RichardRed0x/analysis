I am having some problems with bizhongchou.com.
I followed the guide few weeks ago and successfully transferred some test funds from the site to MyEtherWallet. Now I want to transfer all of it(the feeling of having it on MEW is way more safe than having it on some Chinese website), but can't.
Steps I followed(just like the first time):

1. logged in
2. https://bizhongchou.com/account-money_carry_bank.html
3. clicked on 提现(withdraw) under 众筹项目资产地址:(QTUM address)
4. there it says 请先完成实名认证高级认证
请点击此处直接 [返回] 或者等待三秒钟后自动跳转。 which translates to:
""Please complete the real-name authentication advanced certification
Please click here to go back directly or wait three seconds after the automatic jump.""
6. I already provided my name, address, passport number etc.. Account is verified at 50%. After that 4. step it redirects me to https://bizhongchou.com/settings-security.html. The only thing in red there is Chinese phone number(未绑定), which I don't have. Is that the problem? Why wasn't that requirement there the last time? 

In short, what can I do? Will there be english version of the site?
Also, does anybody have any email for support? Can't find it...

Changes made through this week to the core wallet:

Bugs fixed:

* [EVM/Consensus] Fixed a bug with the minimum gas price consensus rule

* [DGP/Consensus] Increased the maximum serialized block size to allow DGP to work properly with segwit blocks

Work completed:

* [Build System] Reworked the build system so that Ethereum's cmake system is no longer used. Imported cryptopp directly into the Qtum repository. Reworked some Bitcoin dependencies so that they also work with cpp-etheruem

* [Build System] Made the Gitian build system work properly for all platforms, making it possible to easily do deterministic builds for Linux, Windows, and OSX. 

* [Documentation] Updated the gitian and release process documents to work specifically for Qtum

* [DGP/Consensus] Moved several DGP consensus rules to ConnectBlock rather than CheckBlock, fixing a bug where DGP rules could cause initial syncing to fail

* [AAL/Consensus] Ensure that the ""deleteAddress"" list is always cleared after execution. This was the cause of a major performance problem in testnet-1 where contract execution would get slower and slower the longer a Qtum node remained running

* [EVM/Consensus] Disallow the EVM CREATE opcode to be used to create a contract with coins. Contracts must first be created and then sent coins

In-progress work and soon to be fixed bugs:

* [misc] We are doing final testing and preparing to create the final testnet-2 network. It will be complete this week. Testnet-2 (skynet) should behave as close as possible to the mainnet. We do not intend to add more consensus features and will only add non-consensus features (such as new GUI work etc) and bug fixes through this period.

It achieves this through the revolutionary Account Abstraction Layer. For more general information about Qtum as well as links to join our community, go to https://qtum.org

Welcome to Qtum Skynet, the second public testnet for the Qtum blockchain. The previous testnet was named Sparknet. The testnet is only for testing, as such, its tokens hold no value and production applications should not yet be created on the testnet blockchain. All tokens aqcuired during the testnet will cease to exist when the mainnet is released which actually has tokens which hold value. The purpose of the public testnet is to allow developers to begin testing and developing applications, allow early adopters to see a preview of how the network will behave, and for the Qtum development team to run several load tests which are not directly comparable when done on a private and controlled network.

Qtum Skynet will ideally have the same consensus features and parameters as the Qtum mainnet. We do not intend to add new consensus features during this period and the Skynet testnet should be a very realistic preview of how the mainnet network will function and behave. We will be added new non-consensus features such as new RPC commands, GUI features, and of course bug fixes and other things that make Qtum easier to use without modifying the blockchain protocol.

The major features and improvements implemented in Skynet include:

The Decentralized Governance Protocol is completely implemented and functional

The Smart Staking Protocol is complete to our specifications (Sparknet was missing a feature called MPoS which makes attacks more expensive to execute)

A very early and basic smart contract GUI has been implemented that can be used for creating contracts, sending data and Qtum to them, and checking their status by executing them locally
A great number of bug fixes and various improvements, including a bug fix to a performance problem which caused Sparknet nodes to sync extremely slowly as the blockchain grew larger
All Solidity operations for smart contracts behave as expected now. The only compatibility break is contracts are not allowed to create contracts with an initial endowment of coins. The contract must first be created and then sent coins in a separate transaction.
For more technical information for how to start developing with Qtum Skynet please read the Guide and also see this tutorial for deploying a simple faucet smart contract (it hasn't yet been updated for Skynet, but all the instructions are the same)",NA,"6tz6js",NA,0,NA,"false",1504686570,"false","self","t5_3ilam","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/Qtum/comments/6tz6js/qtum_releases_skynet_with_decentralized/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

Accepting Qtum on their token sale !","Participating in the Hash Rush project &amp; Rush Coins ICO

We truly believe Hash Rush will be a great game. But with all that said, we need the participation of the wider crypto and gaming communities to make this project into a success.

There are three ways to take part in the Hash Rush project. First, you can join our Hash Rush mining pool later this year. Should you choose to mine with us, you will receive in-game bonuses and Rush Coins on top of your normal payout in ETH.

Second, we have are currently launching the Hash Rush PR Campaign. Participate in this campaign using Facebook, Twitter or the blog of your choice. Active participation will be rewarded with real Rush Coins, so make sure to take a look!

Third, this September we are organizing our Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and pre-ICO. This means you can purchase the first (ERC-20 compliant) Rush Coins.

You will be able to purchase RC with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) or Ethereum Classic (ETC) &amp; Qtum. The initial conversion rate is 1000 RC for every 1 ETH, and the advantages of purchasing Rush Coins during the (pre-)ICO are:

    Beta access to the Hash Rush game
    Choose your own faction without waiting in queue
    Get special in-game titles, badges and tradable cards
    Receive a Rush Coin conversion rate bonus of up to 25%

Note that the Pre-ICO will run from 16 August 12.01 pm (CET) to 1 September, with a minimum entry threshold of 50 ETH 5 Bitcoin 1000 QTUM or ETC. The ICO will run from 13 September 12.01 pm (CET) until 13 October, with a minimum entry threshold of 0.1 ETH.

Very recently Qtum traveled to Seoul, S. Korea to meet with people interested in the project. Qtum's co-founder, Patrick was joined by John, Stella, and Xiaolong, who presented for nearly 90 minutes. There were a lot of topics covered, so this is a summary of the highlights. The meetup was held at Seoul’s D.Camp, one of the largest startup ecosystems in Korea, and was attended by over 100 people from the local blockchain industry.

1.  QTUM has been listed on 2nd largest Korean exchange, CoinOne.

2. Mainnet Release will be happening on September 13th 

3. Qtum will pay dividends when the Mainnet does releases.These dividends like Neo with Gas will be payed out by keeping the MainNet wallet open, however unlike Gas it won't be its own crypto with rather you would be claiming QTUM tokens. **Edit:Check the thread for the explanation**

Will be listed at 6pm Korean standard time.

Edit: Delayed due to exchange blockchain synchronisation. ETA unknown.

Edit2: Synchronisation is almost complete. The market will open 2 hours after wallet synchronisation completes. The exact time is TBA.

Edit3: Coinone undergoing maintenance in 3 minutes. If this is for QTUM, should be opening at 8pm KST. Will update when certain. Also according to the chat, Koreans are aware that the price is high so they may sell it straight away, but the buying power may be higher. Will only know once it opens. Just be aware.

Edit4: Maintenance extended another 20 minutes until 6:20 KST

I've just shapeshifted 1 ETH to QTUM and sent the QTUM's to my etherwallet.

Questions I would like to ask.
1) I can see the QTUM arrived through https://etherscan.io/mywalletaddress as received but can't view it in MEW under 'Token Balances', can only see OMG and 0x. Any reasons why? Am I looking at the wrong place?

2) If I were to trade it through MEW, how can I? Under 'Send Ether &amp; Tokens' through MEW, it doesn't give me an option to select QTUM to send out. Only ETH and other tokens I have stored such as OMG and 0x.

Appreciate if someone can help me out here as I am a bit confused :S

Is there a well defined roadmap for the QTUM technology WITH APPROXIMATE TARGET DATES? Can someone point me to that? 

2. What is the significance of the ""mainnet"" going live on Sept 13? What is acheived?

3. What's the state of the network? Congested nightmare running on top of ethereum or something else? Is that what the ""mainnet"" addresses?

4. What big events are upcoming in the next two months besides the Sept 13 mainnet launch?

5. Is bithumb on the radar for exchanges trading QTUM? Or, what exchanges not currently trading are on the radar before the end of 2017? Bitfinex? Poloniex? 

6. What is the status of a stable bug-free wallet? Good to go or issues lurking in reliability?

7. If QTUM is adapting the ethereum virtual machine and smart contract approach, how are they addressing the ongoing problem of the ease with which ethereum has been hacked in the recent past and bad smart contracts have led to big losses? 

8. Is QTUM putting together something similar to the ethereum alliance? That is a big marketing point for ethereum, however specifically useful it has or has not been. Maybe it is an Asian-focused alliance?

9. How does the QTUM team see the potential China ICO crackdown? Concern? Mitigated by the Singapore HQ? To what extent has QTUM marketed itself as an ICO engine or does it impact Neo much more?

10. If I was going to run an ICO, why should I use QTUM rather than the competion?

11. If there was a very brief few sentences on how QTUM is different/better than every other crypto fighting for investors/speculators/long term holders, what would they be?

12. Where is the most QTUM community activity? Slack? Here? Somewhere else?

The two main take-away is that both ICO's and cryptotrading in general are soon to illegal in China. 

Many people have pointed out that Qtum is based in Singapore and that they should be ok....but many of Qtum's volume is not in Singapore....it's from China. 

As of now 30% of Qtum volume is still from China. Neo only has about 16% of the volume coming from China.

Going through the top 100 coins I didn’t have to look far #15 Qtum, fantastic project.  Love what the team is going for - If we want the blockchain to enjoy mass adoption (which we do) we should keep it simple for businesses – which is exactly what Qtum is going for: quick, easy, mass adoption.

What is QTUM? is a hybrid of Ethereum and Bitcoin technology, with its own technology interjected in between thus making it useful for big firms, like consultancy.

Corporate governance – Refreshing to see a team taking this so serious. Understanding the importance of transparency and I believe even enlisting the services of a Big 4 accountancy firm to review their books, fantastic – also doesn’t sound like something a scammer would do.   

Dispelling the ‘scam’ (word get thrown around way to much imo) rumours once and for all – Do you know what they called Steve Jobs when he temporarily left apple – it’s a lot worst then ‘scammer’ I can tell ya that. 
Ever heard of the disgruntled/jealous/grieving ex-employee smearing their former employer – classic example. It’s distasteful, disrespectful, wicked slander. But hard work will pay off; and baseless accusations will wear off!

But what is Qtum developing when their mainnet is released? 17 projects are in the works of which 4 are good to go on the day of  the release.

I had to book a restaurant for my company retreat this weekend; but how do you know if it’s any good? Pictures are ‘window dressed’, google street view only goes so far. Insert Vevue project – make videos, earn bitcoin.

Other exciting projects include: Energo, Inkchain and Bodhi.

The fantastic main developer has a blog (Earlz.Net) where he describes his work/understanding of the blockchain in incredible detail; he’s on top of every development and worked in the industry for many years. He also brings the topic with some humour – not easy ;).

But don’t take it from me here is another excellent report that came to the same conclusion.

Space Chain brings blockchain technology into space, adding a new dimension to blockchain’s core concept of distributed ledger by making use of space technology and advantages of space resources.  As a space blockchain platform featuring data collecting, computing, application and storage, Space Chain uses satellites as its blockchain nodes for realizing direct on-satellite data processing and secure in-space data storage through cryptographic technologies such as quantum communications. Different from ground-network-based blockchain technology, Space chain provides a broader coverage and is based on a network of LEO satellites for achieving broad-based connectivity so that anyone and anything could become the user of blockchain technology anywhere and anytime.   Space Chain has already integrated the quantum-secured blockchain node into a Nanosat to be launched by the end of this year and it will be the world’s first space-based blockchain node. The project plan is to launch 3 validation satellites and open the blockchain test platform to the world in 2018. Another 4 satellites for blockchain services will be launched in 2019 to realize primary application and then a constellation of 72 blockchain-based satellites will be deployed in the following years to realize full application. The project has attracted top experts in space and blockchain technology from the US, Europe and China and a large group of young people who aspire to make a difference in the world. It will further promote the application of cutting-edge space and blockchain technologies and explore the development of blockchain technology on the Moon, the Mars and in deep space. Also, the project will serve Space and STEAM education, wildlife protection, high-risk asteroid monitoring and other public welfare undertakings for making collective efforts to achieve sustainable development of human society and civilization and exploring infinite possibilities of outer space in the future.

This is my first post. Longtime NEO holder and trader looking for another long term growth investment so I've bought in.
It actually depreciated since me purchasing which isn't an ideal situation, but I've come to realise the rough has to be taken with the smooth in this game so I'm not too concerned. 
It appears the business has some solid tech albeit not totally unique and appear to have previously made good on any project milestones that have been advertised, which I generally take as a good indicator.

However, I'm trying to establish when the Main Net actually gets or got deployed, having read through the posts already in existence and information published from the AMA I'm still unsure.
People are using lots of differing terminology (as per the title) to describe the current state of deployment and tbh it confuses me. My understanding of the AMA output was that today was the launch, but what does that actually mean........  
I can see blocks mined on the block explorer but crucially are these transactions made by Joe public or just internal ones, because if they are just internal I don't really see what the launch actually represents in terms of milestones.

Basically I'm assuming until the token swap takes place that the MainNet will not be in use by the public despite being ""launched"" and I'm trying to get some clarification.

That in mind can any one point me to a definitive source of information?

Cheers

People with integrity spend their time informing others about the great things their company provides in the space rather than spend their time in their competitors forum(s) spreading complete b.s. 
As the old and very true saying goes -
Look over your shoulder to see if your competitor is gaining on you, and you lose the race! That little bit of energy spent looking over your shoulder instead of concentrating on the race ahead is all it takes.... and it is absolutely true.
I suggest you become a positive force for crypto in general, God knows there are already enough fools trying to bring crypto down.... 
We need good people that understand the movement. People that love the idea of cryptocurrency and who want the companies with good intentions to succeed. Not people that take their time to come to a particular forum just to try and dissuade others from investing without any real proof as to why.
Why spread rumour, or blatantly make stuff up in hopes that it will prevent Qtum or any other crypto from gaining ground? 
My suggestion is that you actually take an hour of your time, and really look into Qtum top to bottom... in doing so you will find a good home for a % of your portfolio. 
There is a lot of room for competition, and over time we will see 3 of these competitors working together on some level not against each other.
Ever wonder why the cofounder of ethereum is backing Qtum? 
For me it couldn't possibly be more obvious that Qtum is on the path to be a leader in the space, and I know for absolute fact some of the biggest names in the industry and out believe the same thing.

On a fundamental level in terms of their business-partners and additional projects/advancements, as well as the $/share price (which always follows slightly afterwards in a healthy way). 

I bought in @16$ and @11,80$ and will buy more in a couple of days ... I'm following the exact same procedure as i did with Lisk. Back then I bought in @2,8$ and got my whole stack in, when they consolidated at around ~2$ ... their fundamentals were (and are still) right and for some fuckdup ""I don't simply understand how the fuck"" reason, people didn't bought in till it suddenly jumped up to 3x and more .... (this is no financial advise btw).

Read yourself into the fundamentals of the technology of decentralized blockchains and cryptocurrencies, make sure you can believe in your perception of its future value, UNDERSTAND how governments regulations and bans are affecting its growth and one more thing ... don't be the guy/girl who follows a ""chickens"" opinion.

The email will look something like this... BEWARE

Recently, Zeppelin Solutions (https://zeppelin.solutions) did a full audit of our token smart contract.
Unfortunately, *they found 3 critical issues*, that are eventually going to be used by attackers.
Zeppelin Team created a new secure and reliable QTUM token contract for us.
But now QTUM token holders have to update their QTUM from the old contract to the new one.

*Qtum Team is asking everyone to upgrade QTUM token contract and secure their QTUM tokens now!*
This is extremely important and we have to finish this process as fast as possible.

To securely upgrade your QTUM contract, use our QTUM token upgrade app - https://qtum -token.com/ upgrade/
It will check the security of your QTUM and will help you to upgrade it automatically.

Old tokens will become worthless once the upgrade is complete.
Exchanges are already updating our token contract and old tokens will not be tradable anymore.
If you hold QTUM on any exchange - withdraw it on the personal wallet and use the upgrade tool.

Thanks for understanding,
Qtum Team

I am very heavily invested and I see a bright future. Every project has its naysayers, but if the underlying team and concept is strong, it doesn't matter. The idea behind QTUM is very strong and easy to understand for non-technical people. It takes the best of bitcoin and ethereum, keeps compatibility, melds them together, and makes key improvements. You can even leverage ongoing improvements in both of those existing projects as they happen and adapt for your project. That's great and its a winning formula. It's easy to sell this concept. But to be successful, the team leads need to be out front showing continuous presence and control. 

QTUM leads need to take this post to heart:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/70kayx/so_these_guys_release_their_mainnet_on_the_13th/

Bottom line: You guys need better communication. 
I know you don't have a giant team, but this isn't that hard and it isn't rocket science. It's basic discipline. You need one of the project leads (not a mod) to post and answer ""burning"" questions every day or every couple of days, directly. Even better, roll up the answers to the biggest concerns/questions and post on twitter or another official source (once again daily or every couple of days). A reddit sticky works as well, but its not as high profile. This is not a job for a mod, it is a job for a project lead with direct knowledge of and involvement in day to day activity. Good discipline demands you communicate EVEN IF YOU HAVE NOTHING NEW. Always communicate.

IF THERE IS A PROBLEM, PEOPLE CAN LIVE WITH IT IF YOU COMMUNICATE PROMPTLY, OFTEN AND WELL through official channels (i.e. not relegated to slack or whatever you move to). Please fix/improve your communication. You are hurting yourself and your investors.

The mainnet release seems nothing more than a Pump now, after the timer finished the site went down, all communications stopped and all we have left is people with money invested scratching their heads as to what is the best gameplan from here. Wild speculation is abound, ranging from ""the team is just busy"" to ""this was their exit strategy"". All we have left in terms of response is a bunch of over invested shills who pile up on every piece of critical writing but it wont be long until their support is gone too. this is all to be expected since the source of this problem is the Qtum team and their total radiosilence. I actually thought this entire sub was being ignored until I read a teammember response to a sidequestion in another thread today: https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/70kayx/so_these_guys_release_their_mainnet_on_the_13th/dn412sm/ so its just the big questions that are being ignored. this is not a good look at all. it's been days since the qtum mainnet release and you have nothing to show for it. 


I'm diversely invested in multiple things and see potential in the Qtum concept. the short term dip means nothing to me. but the team is what I invest in, and the team is what's failing us right now. if I pull out, I pull out because of that.


Bonus: the standard shill responses soon to be found in this thread ;-) 
""Stop spreading fud over a faulty website"" ""You must be new to crypto"" ""Qtum is going to be HUGE and you will come crawling back when (x)"" ""People in this sub are so (x) take your weak hands elsewhere"" ""Its only been a few days the team is busy"" ""why dont you take your money elsewhere and leave the gains for us"" 

If you're so invested that you make critical posts like this a personal matter, you are probably too invested and should start thinking about an exit strategy. good luck!

EDIT I totally forgot about ICO365, which also seems to be one of those returning sores in here. Once again, not a good look.

We have sent your tokens back to QTUm team. You can get your ETH back from there. And please withdraw your ETH / BTC, don't leave on ico365.

I'm currently storing my QTUM tokens in MyEtherWallet.
I have a few questions regarding mainnet token conversion:

1. Bittrex

https://medium.com/@Qtum/qtum-community-development-updates-september-18-31970934b7d3
When the tokens are converted after October 4 this would require me to install an ignition wallet on my PC which is probably a disk space issue.
Is it possible to store the mainnet tokens in a fresh MyEtherwallet address?

2.
As I'm storing them currently in MyEtherWallet. What happens if I miss the October 4 deadline?  Don't they get converted to mainnet tokens when I want to sell them at a later time?

This can only happen on designated XC's. Therefore all ERC-20 token holders have to get their tokens to a designated XC. The problem is time and unforeseen holdups. Firstly, a natural human tendency is to leave things to the last minute. Don't do this with your tokens. Secondly, many of us assume that things will go smoothly, but often that isn't the case. Consider making a journey on a national holiday; you've worked out the route and the time needed, say 2 hours. However, on the day there is a major holdup and your journey takes 8 hours = mission failure. What sort of things might slow down the Ethereum blockchain anytime between now and October 4th? Well, other ICO's that want payment in ETH and this might slow the blockchain down. Secondly, if a major world event kicks off such as with North Korea that could have unpredictable effects on the Ethereum blockchain and all other blockchains. For example, there might be a stampede of buying ETH. Or mining pools in some areas might have loss of power supply. Also, keep in mind that the west coast of North America might now be within range of Kim Jong Un's missiles.
Another category of potential holdup would be that of individual XC's as opposed to blockchain holdups. XC’s could just grind to a halt in the event of a flight into crypto during a major world event. Or, on a less dramatic basis, if lots of QTUM ERC-20 token holders are all trying to register at a limited number of exchanges in a short space of time there could be big holdups such as with I.D. verification.
Usually, it is wise to keep your wealth in cold storage for as long as possible and not on an XC. However, in the case of (worthless) ERC-20 QTUM tokens I think it's best to get them into a designated “swap” XC as soon as possible ready for conversion into real QTUMs.
So what am I saying? Get your QTUM ERC-20 tokens ""put to bed"" as soon as possible. I made sure I did this before making this post, 14 full days before October 4th. The whole world could kick off anytime. Have your tokens in the right place. Then go for a coffee and relax

Everyone reading this can reach their own conclusions. Obviously ""no one really knows"" what will happen. I only put my own conclusions in for people's interest. I'm not for one minute saying that I know best; but I do know my own position on these matters.
The three criteria are 1. Geographic and political location.  2. Regulatory ""threat"".  3. Jurisdiction i.e. what legal system the XC comes under.
The five exchanges, I understand, are ChBTC, Bittrex, Allcoin, BTer and Coinone. I'll take them one by one.
ChBTC is in China. There is geographic and political stability, so no upsets there. Massive regulatory threat. Legal system wouldn't ""go after"" ordinary investors, only after ""the big fish"". My worry about a China based XC is their current reaction against anything connected to an ICO, such as QTUM.
Bittrex in in the USA. Geographic and political stability can be taken fairly much for granted unless Kim Jong Un fires at the US West Coast. There's no regulatory threat to ""pure"" crypto trading. But there is a great, personal, potential threat from the US legal system to any individual whose identity is registered in US jurisdiction. If the US legal system, for example, mistakenly listed you under the heading of money laundering for the purpose of terrorism...God help you.
Allcoin is in Canada. Great geographic and political stability. Light regulatory touch on crypto at present. And it's legal system doesn't persue foreign nationals in the same way that the US system does. Canada: Allcoin would be my choice.
BTer is in British Virgin Islands. Geography? It has just been devastated by Hurricane Irma. Is the XC building still standing? Are power lines still up and running? There's no regulatory threat and there's no particular legal threat.
Coinone is in South Korea. Geographically and politically probably the most worried and unstable place on Earth with KJU armed to the teeth in the North and their main defender being Donald Trump, who tweets his national policy. No regulatory threat to speak of. I'm not aware of any problems with the Korean legal system unfairly pursuing foreign nationals. 
Finally, what is the elephant in the room, that no one is noticing? Or rather, what is the elephant NOT in the room that no one is noticing? WHY, OH WHY is there not A SWISS EXCHANGE ON THE LIST? Switzerland ALWAYS ticks all the right boxes in these matters. If anyone from the Qtum team read this, please try to get a Swiss XC on board.

I am a committed supporter since I first heard about Qtum in March 2017. Whatever happens I will leave my Qtums in. BUT, I have a message for the Qtum leadership. There is a life or death problem for Qtum that you need to address as soon as possible. It's this: When you go onto the CryptoCompare website you can see the listings, worldwide, against the major currencies. There are 1093 cryptos listed against BTC. There are 143 cryptos listed against the USD. 42 are listed against the Yuan (CNY), 15 against EUR, 8 against the Yen (JPY) and 8 against the Korean Wan (KRW). QTUM NO LONGER APPEARS ON ANY OF THESE GLOBAL LISTINGS. IT HASN'T DONE SO FOR THE LAST WEEK. THE GLOBAL CRYPTO MARKETS HAVE DROPPED QTUM. YOU MUST DO SOMETHING.
It doesn't matter how brilliant and how on track the Qtum Project is IF the global markets have written QTUM off as JUNK. I'm posting this because I care about QTUM and I'm in this to the end. I'm speaking as a friend of QTUM; and sometimes friends have to say tough things. So what do I suggest to the Qtum leadership? Firstly your focus of attention until after the swap needs to be on global crypto markets AND GETTING QTUM BACK ON THE BOARD. 2. The idealistic, young Qtum team haven't got the ability to do this. 3. Qtum need to get their hard-headed, market-wise angel backers to step in and GET A GRIP ON THIS SITUATION AND TURN IT AROUND. 4. You must make a headline expansion in a major, world crypto country to make up for the CRYPTO EARTHQUAKE AFFECTING CHINA. Could I suggest Russia, which is up and coming in the crypto scene. 5. Speaking of Russia, I think Qtum should call in Vitalik Buterin as a special, emergency adviser to ensure QTUM survives the next few weeks. 6. Get on board as soon as possible exchanges in the following countries: Switzerland, Singapore, Poland, Australia, New Zealand, Ukraine(Live Coin) 7. If Qtum looks like it's going to disappear completely consider doing what central banks did in 2008: QUANTITATIVE EASING i.e. within a given, target country, literally give out QTUMS to promote uptake AND OVERALL QTUM SURVIVAL. I would suggest: Ukraine, Russia, Poland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada. The reason that I say this is because your ""Crypto Foundations"" in China are disintegrating because of the regulatory actions of the government. YOU MUST SHIFT YOUR PERCEIVED BASE OUT OF CHINA AND BE SEEN BY THE CRYPTO WORLD THAT YOU HAVE DONE IT 8. YOU MUST get an attention-grabbing headline that will put QTUM back on the world crypto scene. Something like this would do it: QTUM enters talks to partner the Russian Space Agency to provide the first Dapps to the International Space Station. (You'd need Vitalik's connections and support to achieve this)
SUMMARY. THE QTUM TEAM ARE GREAT. THE PROJECT IS GREAT. I'm a supporter. I'm in this to the end. THE QTUM TEAM HAVEN'T GOT THE ABILITY TO TURN THE MARKETS AROUND. THE QTUM TEAM NEED TO GET THEIR BIG, ANGEL BACKERS IN TO TAKE CONTROL. And perhaps get Vitalik in as a SPECIAL EMERGENCY ADVISER.

FYI i'm a tech savvy layman. here are some of my concerns -- can you (preferably someone from QTUM -- Brett where are you -- allay them?)

1. is there a chance my QTUM will just disappear in the swap? like could the code implode to a degree that means everything just gets wiped out? and if so, whats's the steps to get them back (e.g. records on the old blockchain -- should we be taking note of these?)

2. i use a trezor/myetherwallet combo -- what happens if i just keep my balance there on oct 4?

3. in line with that, what's your advice for safest, best course of action for someone with their QTUM currently on Trezor... still move them all to bittrex? and if bittrex is best, what should we do post-Oct 4, once the swap happens, and i want to get my coins off the exchange ASAP?",NA,"733105",NA,0,NA,"false",1507610923,"false","self","t5_3ilam","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/Qtum/comments/733105/coin_swap_questions_concerns/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

**Table of Contents:**

* QTUM Staking overview - Like mining, staking won't work unless the QTUM software is actively running and connected to the network, typically 24 hours a day.  Unlike mining, staking doesn't max your CPU/GPU. https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/qtum-staking-tutorial-using-qtum-qt

* Qtum-Qt - Graphical utility, can be used for staking. Raspberry Pi install doesn't have Qtum-Qt.

* qtumd - command line daemon, can be used for staking from PC or rPi

* qtum-cli  - command line utility used to interact with the daemon or service

* Windows PC - https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/qtum-staking-tutorial-using-qtum-qt

* Linux PC

* Raspberry Pi - https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/qtum-staking-tutorial-using-qtumd-on-a-raspberry-pi-3


**Cold Storage**

Without staking, you can still store QTUM private keys offline.  (I'm assuming some of this from my experience with Bitcoin and Ethereum.  Some of the following statements could be inaccurate)

* **Airgap PC**: This is a PC that will never connect to the Internet.  Private keys can be generated here and remain here or be printed and this machine's memory can be destroyed. ($10 Raspberry Pi micro SD can be destroyed after printing if you want).

* **USB** - what are the minimum fields needed to keep value in cold storage?  Is there a just a private key or seed to copy or do we have to create a custom password protected wallet backup and back that up?

* **Paper wallet** - Need a tutorial on how to store QTUM on a paper wallet.  What are the minimum required fields?  What are the steps to restore and transfer QTUM from a paper wallet next year or 5 years from now?

* **Hardware Wallet**: offline, not staking, similar to keeping QTUM keys on airgap, USB, or paper wallet.  For hardware wallets not compatible, what if we use the password manager feature and just store the keys in the hardware wallet, but not have hot wallet features?  Which keys do we store?

* **Cloud drives**: Encrypt keys and copy encrypted backups to multiple cloud drives.  Not my style, but curious how to do this with QTUM.

The original wallet, when I attempt to open, now reports ""Error loading block database. Do you want to rebuild the block database now?"" and then gets stuck at 31 weeks behind again with 0 node connections. I tried your instructions for restoring the wallet but no data directory is re-created in Windows: %APPDATA%\Qtum (on my system I have: E:\AppData\qtum)

So now the old wallet won't sync and the new wallet won't recognize any QTUM in my wallet.dat. What am I doing wrong?",NA,"79uihn",NA,0,NA,"false",1510499697,"false","self","t5_3ilam","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/Qtum/comments/79uihn/recovering_qtum_from_walletdat/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

Here is where I am:

My Pi is up and running. I access it with a monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Using its native web browser, I downloaded the appropriate Qtum Linux Wallet (qtum-0.14.3-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz). Now, since the wallet files are actually ""shared library"" files, I cannot open them. They prompt me to choose an application with which to open them. I'm at an impasse and literally don't know what else to do. How can I open the wallet file?

Also, once I get to open the wallet file on the Pi, how do I access my current wallet? I am already staking. I have the .dat file as a back up in a secure USB, but I simply can't get my mind around how I can use this to access my wallet on the Pi.

CryptoMinder has a guide on Steemit, but as a tech retard, it's quite difficult for me to follow.

I hope someone is willing to help T_T ",NA,"75u282",NA,0,NA,"false",1510425266,"false","self","t5_3ilam","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/Qtum/comments/75u282/need_help_staking_qtum_on_raspberry_pi_3_newbie/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

I can copy and send funds to my matching public address only, without the private key ever touching the internet.  I can print my private key to paper on a 1 inch QR code and put the only copy in a physical vault if I want.

I can even spend ETH or BTC and many other coins without the private key ever touching an internet connected PC.  To spend securely from just a private key, I can create a PC off the internet, like a $35 Raspberry Pi, copy/scan/type my private key there, generate an offline transaction, signing it with my private key, then copy only the signed transaction to the internet connected PC, not my whole wallet file or private key.  That transaction can be sent to the blockchain and be spent only once, with guarantee of no double-spend.  This is similar to how a Trezor works without ever sending the private key off the device and without connecting it to the Internet.

I've heard so much about staking from QTUM and exchanges.  Where are the basics of cryptocurrency security?  Without the basics, fewer holders with security knowledge will invest. Staking is great, but if QTUM is a stakers only coin or exchange only coin, it will hold the price down.  Imagine if the only people holding Bitcoin or ETH were miners.  Hopefully the basics are there and I've just missed reading it.  Please publish an offline transaction guide if QTUM has that feature.

Give paper wallet instructions as well.  I don't want to store a 88Kb wallet file on paper.  Please be as secure as BTC and ETH is and not require huge bloated wallet files for core security.  Is QTUM as secure as BTC or ETH?  Can I hand my spouse a 1in paper QR code and they can securly transfer half the balance from an offline transaction like we can with BTC and ETH?

**Qlink, a decentralized mobile network, dedicated to construct an open-source telecom infrastructure on blockchain.** 

&amp;nbsp;

*By tokenizing mobile data and content, Qlink makes cross-border mobile data billing easy and enables each mobile phone to self-manage its data billings.*

*This platform creates a mechanism that enables billing for digital contents in addition to the current conventional data package billing system.* 
 
*This content billing mechanism in turn enables a new content distribution mechanism. For example, one can set his mobile data package as 1GB data + 10 movies in Qlink platform. A user may also bundle his newly created digital content with data and customize that into an individual data package, available for other users’ consumption. It would made advertising in Qlink platform easy and fast as other users can view his digital content for free. Content consumers may also support content creator by offering data token in Qlink platform.*

**Subversion of the communications industry, Qlink, a global mobile data distribution platform based on quantum chains**

&amp;nbsp;

*Article by Unknown Author unknown*

&amp;nbsp;



Recently, the first to the center of the flow billing platform - Qlink announced based on Qtum quantum chain to build the communications industry block chain network, and will soon carry out ICO. Qlink will build a global unified decentralized flow billing platform based on the Qtum quantum chain, bringing more content to the mobile communications industry to achieve cross-scenario billing.

Qlink sponsor - Li Jianbo said, Qlink plans to open ICO in September, will receive Bitcoin and Qtum quantum chain two forms of investment. After Qtum Quantum Chains are released in September, Qlink will issue YYC tokens on the quantum chain in the form of tokens, and more ICO details will be announced in the future. Qlink is a block-chain project based on mobile communication billing for content distribution and networking.   

&amp;nbsp;

It covers three main scenes:  

1.Monetize energy for distribution of mobile content  

2.For the Internet of Things cross-industry scene to enable intelligent contract  

3.Global operator cross - border liquidation

In the case of mobile Internet so popular, Qlink through the flow of money to support the distribution of mobile content, mobile Internet information transmission and value transmission closely together, and truly achieve the flow and content of the package custom. The traditional mobile communications industry is a highly centralized industry, but a high degree of concentration brings the high cost of networking and cross-border billing. Through Qlink's centralization and terminal participation billing model, operators do not need to put too much cost, through the crowdsourcing and terminal nodes to share computing power, to achieve hundreds of millions of product management and digital identity authentication, based on Smart contract management of package bills.

&amp;nbsp;

The Qlink team consists of the original mobile technology team, which has four years of experience in cross-border mobile package distribution. Friends of the mobile has served more than 600 million cross-border people, with more than 40 operators around the world to establish cooperation. It also received support from Song Wo Capital, Ali Xionghan, Guangqi Group and Singapore Changi Airport Group Communications Company. In terms of operators to expand, Qlink has been with China Unicom Guangxi Mianjian company ASEAN Information Port reached a strategic cooperation, landing Qlink billing platform.

Update: We will begin to moderate posts that have no value, specifically posts and topics about the secondary market. We feel that this type of discussion weakens the Qtum brand, and adds nothing of value to our subreddit. This was an incredibly hard decision for us to make, as most members on the team despise censorship. Even our harshest critics have commended us on our tolerance. If your low quality post about trading gets deleted, please don’t take offence. We will not delete posts criticizing the Qtum project. For the dramatic “Wake up call, get it together’ TL;DR style posts that pop up from time to time, do not expect engagement from Qtum staff.

Here Are My Tips To Save Qtum From Dropping More !!","If we compare Qtum supply to other coins it's one of the highest in the top 15 list. 


I guess with this supply and adding to that the staking coins will force the price to go down as you can see broke to time the ATL ( believe me breaking down the all time low is a very bad sign and considered as red flag for investors )

Please let's stop the drama such as look at the USD price 
We all know the usd price is 10 now bcuz of btc 5500
So when btc drop to 3000 of 4000 let's say Qtum is going to fall with it in terms of btc and usd value.

So in my opinion to save this project from falling to $5 or even below the management should consider the following: 

*Burning coins will attract many new investors and this very important since Qtum community is small.

*Stop doing airdrops and make people buy it 
We want buying power not selling bcuz most of guys getting airdrops are selling it (free money!).

*Please hire new marketing guys, the guy handling the marketing should be marketing executive not manager as his profile on LinkedIn doesn't seems to be Superstar to run 1 billion Marketcap company.

QTUM does not have a real STAKE system, they have a raffle ticket system.  Imagine each qtum you own as a raffle ticket amongst the current 5 million out there now (soon to grow to 20+ million in next couple of weeks).  

The staking calculator is only a probability that your raffle ticket will get drawn.  That's like saying you might win the lottery within the next xxx days.  

A better calculation is just take the number of QTUM you are raffling and divide it by 5million.  

But who knows how the raffle is drawn?  Is it randomly selected or is someone sitting at their desk looking over there at QTUM and carefully choosing who to reward to?  
Let's see, friends first, then maybe create some of their own raffle tickets and reward that!

Honestly, it is time for the QTUM team to allocate some time to its community and investors: 

- There are too many posts about how to do ""XYZ"" or ""I have a problem with XYZ"" that would have been prevented if QTUM had guides on the sidebar on ""How to XYZ"" or even ""FAQ's: XYZ."" (I personally understand that it is a multilingual project, but the posts asking these questions are always in English)

- They need better communication. Bittrex swap was set for a certain date but wasn't complete until 4 days later. Yet, there was no update from the QTUM team during the lag period. 

- They need to be more transparent. Why are we getting ""leaks"" from screenshots of their Slack or Telegram chat? Then people asking ""Can anyone confirm?"" or ""Is this real life?"" From a professional standpoint, this type of news should be released through an official document or from a representative (e.g. Vitalik's twitter about Plasma not having an ICO)

- Last but not least... these annoying FUD/moon posts.... self explanatory. There aren't even any rules/guidelines on the sidebar...

Understandably, the QTUM team has been spending ALL of its time on developing its technology. I, personally, have high hopes for QTUM because they are the first to execute a working PoS system. But, if they want to be KNOWN, they will need to start spending some time on their public rep and community. 

(Side note: look at all the FUD about Patrick. This would have been taken care of had they spent a respectable amount of time on public rep)

As with my first ICO venture (Ethereum), my intuition said that something was different and exciting about this project.

There has been no shortage of concerns raised during the ICO and in the time since.  From Patrick's past, to team competency, and ICO issues due to China's political decisions.

I just want to point out the following reasons why my belief in this team is at an all-time high:

1. The team has adhered to the proposed strategy and the projected milestones have been met again and again.  

2.  In just a short period of time the team has proven their ability to produce timely AND effective results.

3.  The team adapted to the ICO issues based on the situation with China.  For example, ICO365 would not release tokens I purchased during the ICO and actually shut down the site.  The team solved the problem by sending myself and others ALL of the tokens we would've otherwise lost.  I've had a unresolved support ticket for a simple issue in with Coinbase for about 5 weeks, but the QTUM team support came in less then a week.  Amazing.

4. The team had a plan and has taken action on multiple fronts.  The ICO, the releases, public speaking, all supporting websites, the swap, the investor relations... you name it, they have it covered.

I have spent the last few hours trying to work out exactly what needs to be done to store and hold QTUM safely. I have gone through dozens of pages on this subreddit and I am still not even close to 100% certain.  
  
Can someone tell me. Is QTUM an ERC20 coin (ie. I should store it on a generic ETH wallet) or is it its own coin with its own wallet?  
There seems to be very conflicting information on here and I want to be sure.  
  
From what I have read and the fact that there is no official wallet listed on the sidebar I am leaning towards it being a standard ERC20 token which I can send somewhere like MEW.  
But then, if I'm wrong...  
  
I would really like to get my QTUM off Bitfinex, but can someone please tell me where I should send it and if it is an official wallet, where is that located? (Presumably if there is an official one it will work like every other wallet and just have a Seed or Private Key I can write down as a paper wallet?)

Alex makes a brief statement:


*""Cashaa can leverage the Qtum smart-contract system by developing mobile apps and also having a performing and scalable PoS platform.""*

I find this statement to be incredibly interesting  

Nothing has been announced,this is **PURE SPECULATION** and **MAY AMOUNT TO NOTHING**.

Regardless I will be monitoring in anticipation in case there **Maybe**  future developments.

So, I'll make an actual post for everyone's benefit.

Qtum's PoS implementation and CASPER serve the same basic purpose and have the same overall goals, but their implementation and design is completely different. First, about CASPER:

* CASPER uses smart contracts in order to track the stakes and funds created.
* CASPER requires a minimum amount of coins to participate in staking
* CASPER requires making a ""deposit"" and locking your coins for a set amount of time in order to participate in staking (I believe this is something like 30 days)
* CASPER provides a partial solution to the nothing-at-stake problem by punishing stakers who misbehave (ie, they lose their deposit)
* CASPER's full nothing-at-stake solution is both the punishment feature, and users choosing off-chain centralized servers to determine which blockchain is legitimate in the case of multiple.

And now, compared to Qtum:

* Qtum uses basic Bitcoin Script opcodes and transactions to track stakes and funds created - We believe this is better just because it has been tested for far longer. It is slightly less flexible, but ultimately encourages decentralization and stability.
* Qtum does not require a minimum amount of coins to participate in staking. 1 coin can help secure the network the same way 1 million coins can, though 1 million coins will of course find more blocks, etc
* Qtum does not require locking your coins. It only requires that the coins mature for about 20 hours before they can be used for staking. Afterwards, the coins can be sent very quickly in case of network issues, private key compromise, etc. (though immediately after your coins have staked, you must wait 20 hours before they can be spent)
* Qtum plans to provide a different solution to the nothing-at-stake problem and will never punish stakers that misbehave other than kicking them off the network. We believe no software can be made perfect, and so the risk of a bug causing the staker to misbehave and lose millions of dollars is unacceptable to us
* Qtum's nothing-at-stake solution will be implemented in 2018 and will be an optional consensus feature (ie, no fork etc required). Basically, we will put some data on the Bitcoin blockchain that can be later verified through SPV. This makes it so that it is impossible for an attacker to lie about when a particular block was created, which is the biggest vector used to construct a nothing-at-stake attack setup.

Beyond that, we are confident that the nothing at stake problem is pretty overblown, at least with the way our consensus system works. It's incredibly expensive to construct the setup for the attack, and when it is all setup, the only nodes you can really convince to follow it are ones synchronizing to the network the first time... and it's incredibly easy to detect by checking any centralized off-chain resource such as block explorers. It is also very easy for us to add checkpoints etc to the code at a more frequent pace and do faster releases in order to ensure that nothing-at-stake chains never have any significant amount of power.",NA,"788oa5",NA,0,NA,"false",1510469850,"false","self","t5_3ilam","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/Qtum/comments/788oa5/qtums_pos_vs_casper_and_the_nothingatstake_problem/",NA,"Team Member",NA,"Qtum Official","",0,1

Any idea of the power output/wear and tear on a cpu? Any leads on how to make a respectable rig even if it would cost far more? Also, are we able to shut down the device to ""give it a rest"" every now and then, or would that immediately disconnect the process and force you to start over?

In case a stacking password makes sense I'd think it makes sense to introduce a wallet with separate passwords for staking and sending

Some say that it might be staking, but I don't see the word staking on the balance sheet. 

I check the address on qtumexploer, the Qtum is there, but it doesn't show on the wallet like it did before.

I'm so confused and kind of panic right now.

Please help!

Thank you in advance.

**update, 1 day after**

1. Missing QTum is till not yet back to my wallet. 

2. I did uninstalled and reinstalled, still showing the same amount.

3. Checked the address that was deposited money to on QTumexplorer, the balance is showing there, but no in my wallet.

4. People mentioned that this happened to them too, but QTum came back to their wallet after a while.

5. I am waiting it out, there is not much I can or know how to do. :/

6. I will update again if there is any changes.

So PoS is random, and follows some sort of statistical distribution, and yea luck is involved, so you may not receive a reward by the expected time, but I was curious as to what the standard deviation looks like?

Maybe the wallet could include that statistic as well, to give us stakers a much better idea of when we could receive a reward

I am concerned because I have an average expected time of, let's say X days, and so far it has been nearly 4X days, and I still haven't received a reward. It has been 4 times the expected time to receive a reward and I still haven't received anything. Is it just that I am extremely unlucky?

Maybe something else is going wrong?

I am becoming more open to the staking pool idea. Anyone know if this is a possibility going forward?



**Update:** I just received a reward. 

According to the Binomial Distribution, the odds of me waiting this long without receiving a reward were about .5% - 3% (Probabilities fluctuated as the Network Weight fluctuated)

I guess those weren't THAT bad of odds, and I was just unlucky.

I would have been more concerned if I reached the .1%-.01% territory, but that didn't happen. To me that would signify that I would have been impractically unlucky to the point that maybe my understanding of the probability of staking is inaccurate. But that hasn't happened so everything is looking reasonable to me.

This tool was made by a legitimate developer, but the website linked to was setup by a malicious person. He took the tool and infected it with screen capture, keylogging, and code designed specifically to steal cryptocurrency wallets. We at Qtum did see the post, but upon first glance it appeared legitimate with an active github, real developers, etc. So, we didn't delete the post. Hours later however a report from a user came in that their coins had been stolen after downloading this tool. We then immediately deleted the post from our subreddit, and began to analyze the download to find that it was infected. We have reported the address and all known details about the attacker to exchanges, but typically there is little that can be done in these situations.

In light of this, and the massive number of people currently staking we would like to remind everyone that our recommendation is ALWAYS to store your Qtum wallet on a separate computer or raspberry pi from your normal every day computer. There are new viruses every day that get through a variety of different protection techniques and most viruses today specifically target cryptocurrency wallets like Qtum. So, we urge everyone to use a separate computer and do not store their wallet.dat file (even encrypted!) on their every day computer. In addition, if you think your machine may have been compromised, even if your wallet is encrypted, you should move all of your coins to a newly generated wallet on a secure computer! Encryption is slow to break, but it is possible with weak passwords, and if the virus also installed a keylogger, they may have logs including your password! There is no such thing as being too paranoid when thinking about the security of your wallet. This also applies to mobile wallets. We do everything we can to ensure the wallet and private key data in the mobile wallet is secure, but there is always the risk of Android or iOS exploits that allow reading this data while the wallet is running.

In order to help reduce the chances of such a situation happening again, the Qtum team and moderators will now delete any post or link saying to download any executable file or application (including mobile apps) across all communities, including Reddit, Telegram, Slack, the forum, and elsewhere. This includes price trackers, market analysis apps, portfolio trackers, and even development tools and kits if it requires running a program (source code and documentation is still ok of course).

If you have made an application for Qtum and wish to post it to one of our communities, please ask a Qtum team member to first review it and if everything looks ok we allow you post it. Posting links to your application multiple times despite it being removed and warnings given will result in a ban. Note: we might refuse to review really minor applications with limited utility due to time constraints for our team. And in addition, just because a Qtum team member reviews an application does not mean it is safe. Viruses and malware can be extremely well hidden and so we can not make any guarantees. 

Thank you, and please keep security in mind when storing your Qtum!",NA,"78k8x0",NA,0,NA,"false",1510475712,"false","self","t5_3ilam","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/Qtum/comments/78k8x0/please_read_downloads_viruses_and_keeping_your/",NA,"Team Member",NA,"Qtum Official","",0,0

I had followed QTUM with interest for a while and I was very excited about the project, so much that when the ICO came I decided to invest a good amount on it, buying 48,224 tokens from ICO365, equal to almost 0.1% of the total ICO offering. The main reason I invested so much in it was the quality of the team behind the project: a quality team for a quality project, I thought. Well, I would eventually change my mind about that.

Around the beginning of September I tried to withdraw my tokens to get ready for the long awaited swap with the launch of Ignition, but when I contacted ICO365 about that I was given the first bad news: no withdraw was allowed until the Chinese situation with the exchanges was clear. Of course I was a bit nervous but trusted that it was only going to be a temporary itch, something that would be sorted very soon. Unfortunately if only got worse. 

After a few days of me chasing them, ICO365 communicated me that the tokens ad been returned to the QTUM Foundation and in order to receive them I had to deal directly with them. After an initial panic and some online research I found this:

https://medium.com/@Qtum/qtum-community-development-updates-september-18-31970934b7d3

the famous development update where they were clarifying the timing of the swap 
&gt;""The Qtum team currently holds all of the main network tokens until the swap happens on October 4th, 2017 (6pm PST)” 
- and the part I was more interested about - 
&gt;""A quick reminder to withdraw your Qtum ERC20 tokens from Yunbi.com, and if you have tokens that were not retrieved from ICO365, please e-mail swap@qtum.org &gt;and we will get back to you within 1–2 weeks. ""- .

I sent my first email to swap@qtum.org on the 19th september, asking for clarification. I didn’t expect them to respond straight away, as they made clear that it would take time, but when 10 days past without any news I started getting worried again. 

I sent them another email on the 29th asking for any more news and what details they needed from me. I got no answer.

On the 2nd of October I sent them a new email, with my ICO365 details, email, username balance and my Bittrex erc20 address, so that they could send them straight there it would be swapped straight away. For the third time no answer. 
We were getting closer and closer to the swap date, and no one was paying any attention to any of my emails. 
Of course at QTUM they were very busy with the launch of Ignition, still it had been over 2 weeks and we were not talking peanuts really. We were talking about 48224 tokens, now worth more that an average property, but still no answer. 

I decided to let the swap period pass so they could sort their things out, but more and more worried by their complete silence. 

On the 9th of October, when the swap was supposed to had been completed for 5 days, I sent another email with the details from the previous one, specifying that the erc20 address was before the swap, and adding the new QTUM address from Bittrex. At this point I was emailing not only swap@qtum.org, but also foundation@qtum.org, hoping for anyone to answer, or at least to acknowledge that someone was looking into it. 

Finally, on the 10th of October I received an answer from foundation@qtum.org. 

It simply read:

&gt;tokens are sent
&gt;https://etherscan.io/tx/0x011c6d4be72386a5b0082e606172e780fe4d6f93336c8bae9d448a0d9779a1cb


Nothing more, not a note, nothing about our previous emails. Not even a greeting, nothing. But even worse, it was an ERC20 transaction. On the 10th of October. After the swap. 

I panicked straight away, they had sent the tokens to the Bittrex ERC20 address I gave them from the old email, despite the deadline of the swap having being a week before. Why would they do that?
First thing I did was to check my Bittrex account, but there was no trace of them there. I contacted Bittrex support straight away, which, contrary to QTUM,  responded  promptly, unfortunately with bad news:

&gt;Hi
&gt;They sent it to the wrong address. We won't recover it since it was sent on the 4th after our wallets turned off.  You contact them about this problem.  
&gt;https://support.bittrex.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001606011-Support-for-the-Qtum-QTUM-blockchain-upgrade


Now I was gobsmacked and, even worse, seriously worries! 
It had already been surreal to receive a 2 line answer from QTUM after all the emails I sent them, how was I going to sort this out? 

In the meantime I received an email from swap@qtum.org which just said: 

&gt;sorry, we cannot send anything to you because we didn't receive any of your information from ICO365 office. please check with ICO365 first.

I didn’t know if I was supposed to laugh or cry. Who was I dealing with? Two email answering my request with opposite responses, both of which didn’t make any sense. 
More and more worried. 

I contacted them again forwarding the Bittrex email asking why they had sent the tokens to an ERC20 address after the deadline that THEY had set up and communicated in their blog, and how we could solve this situation. 
This time the answer was prompt, but their style was the one I was getting used to:

&gt;we just checked again, we sent the tokens to the ERC20 address  0xfd56adb0d3db185afc59c75138b45bde292e8a28 you gave us. and here is the record. you can &gt;check again

I emailed them again and again, pointing out that I cave them the QTUM address, and the ERC20 was before the swap, but there was only silence from their side after that. That was it. 

Now, the current value of the tokens easily surpasses half million dollars, currently reaching almost 600k, and I want to make clear that I’m not millionaire and for me it’s a life-changing situation.
But believe it or not what makes me almost as mad as the money loss is QTUM Foundation behaviour. 

I believe in them, in their project and in their team and I invested in them a fair amount before the ICO craze that hit the blockchain, how could this happen?

I can’t think of any decent company that was dismissing their misplacing of over 120 BTC worth of tokens in a single line. 
I can’t thing of any decent company that would ignore one of their investor’s requests of clarification over a half million dollar transaction which disappeared. 
Nor I can’t think of any decent company with such a combination of arrogance and incompetence blended in a mix of disregard for their investors. 

Is this what the crypto idea of business is? Are these the companies we think will create the future? Incompetent,  arrogant, complacent and, almost more scarily, dishonest? 

What I almost hope is that all this business was dealt by an intern who didn’t have a clue of what he/she was doing nor any english, it’s the only explanation I can think of for the rude responses and the daft actions. My hope would be for someone from QTUM to come forward and offered to take some interest on what has happened, showing some sort of professionalism that would be expected from a billion dollar company. 
Half a million of which they seem to have taken from me for good. 

**-----  UPDATE  -----**

**Final welcome update. All tokens were sent to me yesterday (I could check only now) as I was promised by Patrick. As you can guess it's a HUGE burden off my stomach, and I would like to thank both the community for their support and the team for a prompt help. At the end I think it was just some admin cockup (even though a costly one) and once the team was (eventually) aware of it, they jumped in straight away and solved it. I'd like to thank Patrick Dai for the personal interest he took and, for more than obvious reason, I hope this project can keep going the pace it is. I'm a happy man.
Thank all of you again!**

I transferred my Qtum to my new Qtum wallet and began staking.  The tokens sat for 500 confirmations and then the lightning bolt changed to solid and I was off to the races.  I mined my first block yesterday.  Then a bunch of stuff which I wasn't expecting happened:

First off, I only received a transaction reward for mining the block of:  Credit: 0.40119252 QTUM     Wasn't I supposed to receive 4 Qtum?  When I look on a block explorer, it says that the mining reward was 4 Qtum...so where did the other 3.599 coins go?

Secondly, the lightning bolt in the bottom left hand corner switched back to hollow and the message says, ""Not staking because you don't have mature coins"".   Part of my brain is telling me that this message is only referring to the mining reward I just received and the rest of my Qtum are still happily mining, but I don't know of a way to check this.  These new coins have 456 confirmations now and I will post back on this thread whether or not the lightning bolt goes back to solid after reaching 500 for the new coins.

I'd appreciate any insight someone can give me.  I'm not a big command line guru, so while I can find my way around I would need help with any deep investigations.

Seriously.","If you are panic-posting about the current value of Qtum, you need to untwist your panties and take a long look in the mirror.  Are you a novice trader and crypto investor?  Did you get in over your head on something you don't quite understand?  Are you the type of person that think others are to blame for all of your poor choices and miscalculations?

If you don't have a mirror.  I'll answer these questions for you.  Yes, yes, and I'm sorry.

Investing is calculated gambling with an edge going to those who have information, money, and experience.

Think about that for a minute or whole bunch of minutes.  Now, if you have little to none of those three, you should probably just go put your money on red or black -much better odds.  

Or do this: Do some research and some math and grow your level of understanding.  Work on making money elsewhere so you have something to invest.  Gain some experience mock trading or trading with small amounts.

But for the love of god don't do this: Take money you don't have, put it into one of many forms of a technology you don't understand, and panic and point fingers when it doesn't go the way you had HOPED.  (that's what you are doing: hoping)

Oh and before I forget... market value is a pulse that goes up and down.  Catch my drift lol?

There's nothing wrong with being the person that doesn't know much.

Why does the wallet send all my funds in that address and make my coins have to wait to mature again even though I only sent part of the balance.

It appears that when I send some coins from address A to address B, all my coins leave address A, some go to address B as requested and the delta between my transaction and my total balance of address A get sent to address C which looks to be a new address. Is it just a ""feature"" of the wallet?

This is my third week of reporting on the public deployment of Qtum Mainnet Ignition, examining the parameters and performance of the Qtum blockchain. 

Mainnet saw increasing activity this week, with the token swap on Coinone completed. Unique wallet addresses winning block rewards grew to 343 per day, and the network weight peaked up to almost 16 million. The number of Qtum ERC-20 tokens burned reached 41%, up from 26% last week. In addition to the usual staking results charts and graphs, I cover the following topics:

* Errata on target block spacing
* How is network weight calculated?
* Probability and statistics for block rewards (educational)
* The Qtum Nodemap

I just set up my wallet and let my coins mature, all that startup stuff. My computer's always on anyway.

However...I see it says I'm 'expecting a reward' in 703 days. It actually jumped up to 711 days while I was typing this out. Would staking pools work on qtum? Would it even make a difference? Anyone know about any or how they work? I want to participate, but this just feels silly.

Secondary question; will all Proof of Stake be like this? This seems a bit inaccessible. I thought one of the big pluses to this was accessibility? It doesn't seem that way. I only started throwing a little into crypto when I started reading news about proof of stake. If I'm going to only be able to get a fraction of a coin, maybe, every 2 years with small amounts...that doesn't even seem worth taking my little bit of coinage off the exchanges. Try and catch pump and dumps with it instead or something. 

I obviously am not expecting any sort of remotely huge gains with the amount of crypto I have in proof of stake, but I was expecting similar gains to like if I mined Eth with my single gpu. Not specifically on Qtum, I read it was .4 qtum over 10 blocks or some such, but maybe every 2 years?...come on. I could mine 2 ETH in that time if the calculators are right. This doesn't seem better than proof of work.

But he dropped a real bombshell when he mentioned the satellite they have ready to launch into space and run a lightning network node from. Anyone else besides me think this is huuuuge?? that would mean anyone can send and receive LN transactions without internet access. 

QTUMS focus on mobile simplicity is good as well. They're really simplifying creating smart contracts by focusing on mobile integration and also creating a marketplace to buy smart contract frameworks for non developers.

The qtum team has been dumping 14,000,000 qtum into the market for some time now ..... and the price has remained ""relatively"" stable. This to me is a great indicator of the strength of qtum on exchanges and the faith people have in this blockchain. 

Second, per each unit increase in price the marketcap now grows even larger. I know that because their are more tokens in circulation it will be harder to do so, but new investors look at these things. Look at https://coinmarketcap.com/coins/ we are number 13 and just below ethereum classic! Once we cross the billion dollar market cap and pass ETC expect a lot of recognition and validation in the cryptocommunity.

Jeffrey Wernick’s 40 years of experience includes investments in Uber and Airbnb, after which he turned his focus to bank transactions, lending platforms, and the blockchain industry. His advisory role will help guide Qtum’s international growth and development strategies.

&amp;nbsp;

**Jeffrey Wernick**  

*I meet with many people in the blockchain and cryptocurrency community, and what impressed me about Qtum is the people and their pursuit of intellectual integrity,” said Jeffrey Wernick. “Qtum is committed to decentralization, and their approach to blockchain is more constructive and adaptive than anything else I’ve seen. Qtum is committed to open source where greater privacy is preserved, and greater benefits accrue to everyone participating in the ecosystem.*

&amp;nbsp;

Wernick began his career trading options and futures while studying at the University of Chicago. He later worked at Salomon Brothers, then became the youngest Senior Officer at the National Bank of Detroit. Jeffrey Wernick then launched a technology-focused venture capital firm and created a hedge fund to invest in distressed and bankrupt companies, helping to restructure their balance sheets. As an angel investor, his focused expanded to the sharing economy, biomedical, and blockchain technologies.

&amp;nbsp;

*I have always kept myself anonymous, extremely private, and avoided any recognition of my name. However, now I think the work being done in the blockchain ecosystem and, specifically with Qtum, it is vitally important to be building platforms that are decentralized and trust reinforcing; so, I am going all in,” Wernick remarked.
Qtum recently announced its network launch, Ignition, a groundbreaking blockchain platform which provides the first decentralized governance protocol and proof-of-stake consensus mechanism for smart contracts. Blockchain industry leaders are increasingly looking to Qtum to solve complex issues of scalability and deliverability for their projects, and Qtum delivers a smart contract platform running on a proof-of-stake consensus for the first time.*

&amp;nbsp;

*We’re committed to growing Qtum with guidance from the most experienced minds in technology and finance, and we welcome Jeffrey Wernick as part of this mission,” said Patrick Dai, co-founder at Qtum. “His background in trading, quantitative research, and venture investment gives him unmatched insights.*

&amp;nbsp;


*I have been involved in the crypto world since 2009, and in that year I began speaking to small groups explaining the innovation of bitcoin and blockchain and how transformative this will become,” Wernick stated.*

I am staking on a raspberry pi using the Linux qtum-cli. I can do all the transactions I need to set up and stake (still waiting for the first coins to be earned :-) since the help online is sufficient.

The next best option seems to be myetherwallet. So I've generated a wallet but when I send a test coin from Bittrex to myetherwallet, Bittrex isn't able to authorize the transaction. Not exactly sure what it is I'm doing wrong. Nothing on Youtube seems to explain this.

https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/tag/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.1  

I downloaded https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.1/qtum-0.14.3-win32.zip
However there is no manual included. Where can I find this?

I am just throwing this out there to the people who listen and understand what it takes to make a great community of people. In the last few days, weeks, and months there have been members of the community who have contributed invaluable information to others through documents and videos on staking procedures, wallets, and even recently i have seen price tickers created by people and even a staking calculator. I am not saying to break the bank tipping these people, but if you are benefiting from a resource give back what you can. i'm sure even fractions of qtum would be greatly appreciated. In the world we live in people sometimes need a little incentive to create new ideas and maintain them. I will certainly not be a hypocrite and have started tipping to those projects i've benefited from. let's keep innovating with qtum and helping each other!

There is no reason for this constant toxic price talk.  Everytime the price goes up I see: it must be a pump before the dump or some bull shit... Everytime the price falls I see: the foundation is cashing out or it's some whales.  All the people saying this sort of shit have almost nothing invested and have no understanding how the market works.  Movements are not conspiracies... It's just trading supply/demand timing miss matches.  I know, because I move the market when I trade and know many other people that do as well.  Furthermore, I see others moving it all the time that I'm trading against.. There are no coordinated conspiracies and we are not trying to fuck anyone.

All you people taking part in this sort of rumor spreading are wrong and are harming the community and your investment.  This is crypto and market movements happen constantly and you can't draw conclusions from tiny little movements.  I personally own more Qtum than 99.9% of you (even though I only recently bought in) and I'm fed up with all this bull shit price talk to the point of wanting my investment to go down just to see that portion of the community leave to chase the next speculative piece of shit investment.

Wake up people!  Great things take time and we have huge fundamental improvements exponentially building behind the scenes.  It takes time for the market to recognize this, so don't expect a major price movement anytime soon.  It took ethereum almost a year of hanging around $10 while major investment, development and improvements were occuring before the fundamentals finally forced the price higher.  **So, don't sweat the ride with its ups and downs as long as the fundamentals are improving.**  If they are, it's only a matter of time before to market recognizes this fact.

Apologies if this has been asked before.

I want to move my QTUM tokens from the bittrex exchange over to the Qtum wallet. I installed the wallet on my computer, encrypted it and then transferred 0.5 QTUM as a test. It all went smoothly.

However, I then read that it's best to backup the wallet before you encrypt it. I don't understand the reasoning behind this so if someone could please explain, I would appreciate it.

What's wrong with backing up the wallet after it has been encrypted?

Is there anything else I can do to secure my wallet besides keeping my passcode safe and having a few different backups in different geographical locations?

###Stake-Change Notifications for Raspberry Pi 3 QTUM Stakers - A Tutorial

How to send notifications when the ""stake"" in your Raspberry Pi QTUM wallet changes.

&amp;nbsp;

- This tutorial assumes that you are already **staking QTUM** on your **Raspberry Pi 3**.  You should have a basic understanding of **Linux** and the command line and you should know how to **edit text files**.

- Your **Raspberry Pi** must be connected to the **Internet** and able to **download updates**.

- Text notifications are accomplished by sending email to your email-to-text address, for example for T-Mobile, the address is 1234567890@tmomail.net .

- One caveat: I am using a **Gmail** account to send notifications.  To get this working, I had to ""**allow less secure apps to access my account**"".

- Pro Tip: If you use **PuTTY** for your SSH client, you can save yourself a lot of typing by copying the commands and configuration data from this page and then right-clicking into your PuTTY window to paste. 

&amp;nbsp;


You will need a **Mail Transfer Agent** running on your Pi.  We will install **Postfix**.



- Connect to your Pi as the default **pi user**. Use **PuTTY** or any other SSH client.

- Install Postfix:  
`pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo apt-get install postfix -y`

- Create or modify the Postfix main.cf file (replace first 2 values with your information):   
`pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo nano /etc/postfix/main.cf`  

 `relayhost = smtp.gmail.com:587`   
`myhostname = raspberrypi.yourdomain.com` 
`#`  
`inet_interfaces = loopback-only`  
`inet_protocols = ipv4`  
`alias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases`  
`smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes`  
`smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous`  
`smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd`  
`smtp_use_tls = yes`  
`smtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`  

&amp;nbsp;

- Create password file:  
`pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo nano /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd` 

  `smtp.gmail.com:587 youraddress@gmail.com:yourgmailpassword`

&amp;nbsp;

- Run postmap on sasl_passwd file:  
`pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo postmap /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd`

- Start the Postfix service:  
`pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo systemctl start postfix`

- Enable the postfix service so it will start after a reboot:  
`pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo update-rc.d postfix enable`

- Test the postfix service (you can send email to yourself or to another account):  
`pi@raspberrypi:~ $ echo -e ""FROM: youraddress@gmail.com\nTO: youraddress@gmail.com\nSubject: Test from Pi\n\nTest Message..."" | sendmail -t`

 
- It is likely you **will not receive** the first test email. In that case, you may need to ""allow less secure apps"" in your Google account.  You can do that here: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255 - I found this with the help of this error message in **/var/log/mail.log**:

 &gt;status=deferred (SASL authentication failed; server smtp.gmail.com[74.125.124.109]:587, delay=1.8, delays=0.06/0.12/1.6/0, dsn=4.7.14, status=deferred (SASL authentication failed; server smtp.gmail.com[74.125.124.109] said: ... Please log in via your web browser and ... then try again ... Learn more at ...  https://support.google.com/mail/answer/78754 XXXX - ...)

- To verify email is working, re-send the test message using the sendmail command above.

&amp;nbsp;

Now we will **create the notification script**.  

- Connect to your Pi as the **user** that runs the **QTUM wallet** software. (Examples here use a ""qtum"" user.  If you use a different user, replace as necessary.)

- Create qt-notify directory:  
`qtum@raspberrypi:~ $ mkdir qt-notify`

- Create ""checkstake"" script (Replace Configuration Variables with your values):  
`qtum@raspberrypi:~ $ nano qt-notify/checkstake`

 `#!/bin/bash`  
`#`  
`# Configuration Variables`  
`#`  
`SENDER=youraddress@gmail.com`  
`NOTIFYRECIPIENT=1234567890@tmomail.net`

`QTUMCLI=$HOMEDIR/qtum-wallet/bin/qtum-cli`  
`SCRIPTDIR=qt-notify`  
`WORKDIR=$HOMEDIR/$SCRIPTDIR/work`  
`PREVSTAKE=$WORKDIR/stakevalue1`  
`CURSTAKE=$WORKDIR/stakevalue2`  
`PREVINFO=$WORKDIR/getinfo1`  
`CURINFO=$WORKDIR/getinfo2`  
`#`  
`# Code Execution Below`  
`#`  
`if ! test -d $WORKDIR`  
`then`  
`mkdir $WORKDIR`

`#`  
`if ! test -s $PREVSTAKE`  
`then`  
`SUBJECT=""QTUM Notify Test""`  
`echo "" Test_Notification"" &gt; $PREVSTAKE`  
`fi`  
`#`  
`if ! test -s $PREVINFO`  
`then`  
`    echo ""Test_Email"" &gt; $PREVINFO`   
`fi`  
`#`  
`# Get Info from QTUM Wallet`  
`#`  
`$QTUMCLI getinfo &gt; $CURINFO`  
`#`  
`cat $CURINFO |grep ""\""stake\""\:"" &gt; $CURSTAKE`  
`#`  
`if ! diff $PREVSTAKE $CURSTAKE &gt; /dev/null`  
`then`  
`SENDPREVINFO=$(&lt;$PREVINFO)`  
`SENDCURINFO=$(&lt;$CURINFO)`  
`SENDCURNOTIFY=$(&lt;$CURSTAKE)`  
`SENDPREVNOTIFY=$(&lt;$PREVSTAKE)`   
`#`  
`# Email Notifications`  
`#`  
`echo -e ""FROM: $SENDER\nTO: $NOTIFYRECIPIENT\nSubject: $SUBJECT\n\n\n\nCurrent stake:\n\n$SENDCURNOTIFY\n\nPrevious stake:\n\n$SENDPREVNOTIFY\n\nCheck email for more information..."" | /usr/sbin/sendmail -t`  
`echo -e ""FROM: $SENDER\nTO: $INFORECIPIENT\nSubject: $SUBJECT\n\nQTUM Stake Change...\n\nCurrent getinfo:\n\n$SENDCURINFO\n\nPrevious getinfo:\n\n$SENDPREVINFO"" | /usr/sbin/sendmail -t`  
`#`  
`mv $CURSTAKE $PREVSTAKE`  
`mv $CURINFO $PREVINFO`  
`else`  
`rm $CURINFO`  
`rm $CURSTAKE`  
`fi`  
`#`  
`exit` 

&amp;nbsp; 

- Make the script **executable**.  
`qtum@raspberrypi:~ $ chmod 700 qt-notify/checkstake`

- The **first time** you run the script, it will create a ""work"" directory and **send test notifications**.  Run it now:  
`qtum@raspberrypi:~ $ qt-notify/checkstake`  

- If everything is working, **Schedule** the script to run automatically **every 15 minutes** (Modify the command if your user is not ""qtum""):  
`qtum@raspberrypi:~ $ crontab -e`

 `0,15,30,45 * * * * /home/qtum/qt-notify/checkstake`  

- The crontab -e (edit) command uses 'vi' to edit the crontab file.  Type i to insert. After typing the line, press &lt;ESC&gt;, then type :wq 

- You will now have **automatic notifications** emailed to you when the ""stake"" value of your QTUM wallet changes... **ENJOY**!  

- If you want to send more test notifications, you can delete the ""previous"" stakevalue1 file and the next time the script runs it will send notifications like it did the first time it ran.  You can run the script manually if you don't want to wait for the next scheduled run:  
`qtum@raspberrypi:~ $ rm qt-notify/work/stakevalue1`  
`qtum@raspberrypi:~ $ qt-notify/checkstake`

&amp;nbsp;

In the future, **Hcash** will gradually realize the exchange of assets and rights among platforms, chains and chains, and further expand the digital eco-circulation of encrypted data to maximize the value of smart assets.  

&amp;nbsp;

Meanwhile, as the blockchain community continues to move parallel to the business world, Hpash ecosystem subproject **Hyperpay** will also work with the **Qtum** to provide mobile payment for underlying technology engagement services through Hyperpay to jointly promote blockchain technology Product, improve product usability.  

&amp;nbsp;

At present, the transactions between **Qtum** and **Hcash** can only be relied on by third-party platforms such as exchanges, with the exchange of encrypted digital currencies such as bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. as an intermediary.   

&amp;nbsp;

This exchange mode requires the third-party platform's security functions and efficiency requirements High, and will take some time to complete the specified transaction. However, **Qtum** and **Hcash** cross-chain agreement is completed, you can use the intelligent cross-chain asset exchange protocol to achieve the center of the atomic exchange  

&amp;nbsp;

**Hcash** is a new distributed decentralized ledger system designed to provide a convenient medium for cross-platform value and information interoperability by allowing block-based and blockless-based blockchain systems to allow value and information to be delivered in different areas Block chain transfer and exchange, to overcome the shortcomings of blockchain technology.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Hcash** has emerged as a leader in the field of cryptocurrency by enabling the free flow of digital money among various blockchains and has become one of the largest digital assets in the world. At the technical level, **Hcash's** concept of development is very similar to that of the **Qtum** chain.  

&amp;nbsp;

Based on the UTXO model and through the ValueTransfer Protocol, **Hcash** builds a POS smart contract platform that can be ecologically compatible with Bitcoin Ecology and Ethereum, To achieve the value of the transfer, and link the block chain and social sectors. 

&amp;nbsp;

After Bitcoin, the public and private chains and the coalition chain expanded rapidly. From the current development process of the blockchain, it can be speculated that the future is a huge multi-strand coexistence of value network era. In this value network, the more widely distributed the effective nodes of the connection, the greater the possible value superposit

ion. **Hcash** promotes the liquidity of trust-based value in different blockchain.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Qtum** and **Hcash** cooperate to explore the cross-chain transaction of tokens assets, realizes the connection and expansion of different blockchain using cross-link technology, Block chain value network to enhance the value of different blockchains circulation.  

&amp;nbsp;

**In the future, Hcash tokens will be distributed directly on Qtum's chain system. With smart contracts, DApps will be developed while creating an open, well-scaled alliance ecosystem.**

THEKEY Project, a world-leading solution provider in IDV industry, is here to leverage innovations in Blockchain and Smart Contract technologies to develop its second-
generation IDV solution to address all the above-mentioned issues in the
internet world.

&amp;nbsp;

*""We believe that QTUM combined with BTC and ETH comprehensive advantages and lightweight POS Mechanism of flexible smart contract, can help us to quickly complete the ubiquitous identity application scenarios.*    

*With the QTUM team to explore BDMI implementation process, we have been very valuable advice and help from the design ideas to achieve the skills for better support for front-end identity connection to the center of the identity of the core value of data storage, in the course of this business can use TKY and QTUM real-time settlement in a wide variety of real life scenes""*  
  
**Li Xueli -  THEKEY project leader**  

&amp;nbsp;

*""One of the biggest features of the block chain technology - can not be tampered with, believe that the Internet identification technology breakthrough will also promote the application of block chain technology landing development. Thanks to THEKEY based on the QTUM quantum chain to build the identification system, to jointly promote the development of QTUM chain ecosystem"".*    
 
**Patrick Dai - QTUM Co Founder**

&amp;nbsp;

""Non-repudiation"" and ""no tampering"" are the core and essence of the block chain technology, so the corresponding identification technology must also have the characteristics of ""non-repudiation"" and ""no tampering"". Otherwise, it is impossible to establish a mutual trust relationship in the Internet world. The current network real name system, (VEID) mobile phone real name system and a variety of biometric authentication technology failed to solve the problem of Internet identification of the pain point.  
 
 In this context, the THEKEY project team will develop BDMI technology based on the world's leading **Qtum**, using **Qtum** lightweight terminal smart contract to provide identity services that are ""non-repudiation"" and ""non-tamper"" on the Internet. Solve the problem of network virtualization  

&amp;nbsp;

**THE KEY ACHIEVEMENTS TO DATE**



* **23 copyrights** have been obtained, **15 patents** have been accepted by SIPO (State Intellectual Property office of the P.R.C) and start attestation process.    


* THEKEY’s first-generation IDV solution is currently in use for mobile social insurance pay in two pilot cities, which people can receive their payment for their pension, or healthcare insurance reimbursement. The IDV solution is **currently being deployed in another 41 cities, covering more than 130 million people**.    


* Personal identity data of **210 million people in 66 cities, authenticated by the relevant government authorities**, are connected on a real-time basis. This constitutes a solid foundation of IDV.  

* Commercial contracts signed with world-leading firms and the business model of our IDV products in this White Paper has already been partly proven.  

* **Six relevant national laboratories** have been set up together with **government agencies, banks, insurance companies and one university**

Qtum wallet stopped synching Sat Nov 25th. I'm using the latest version on a Mac computer. I have tried downloading couple times, it didn't fix the problem.  Leaving a question at Qtum.org is a no help. 
How could be believe in Qtum is there is no active help on the website. 
Researching for people posting asking for help, it seems they didn't get helped either. 

This really makes me lose hope in the coin. 

Hopefully someone will help me with this.

Thank you.

**Update** Problem solved.

   First I added nodes provided from https://www.reddit.com/user/QtumOfficial (see in comment below) while still running the open-unable to synch wallet. It didn't work. 

   Second, I closed the wallet, deleted most of the files in Qtum application support accept wallet.dat.
 Then I restarted Qtum wallet, added nodes suggested. After that I waited for it to start synching blocks from the beginning. This worked.

We are deeply grateful to everyone for their long-term concern and support for the Bodhi Project. After a long period of preparation, Bodhi will launch several major exchanges in the near future, combining the topics of interest of many friends. 

&amp;nbsp;

 **The following are the actual rules on the online exchange of BOT:**   
 
&amp;nbsp;

**1. Bodhi token smart contract to complete the deployment of the main chain and testing**  


* The Bodhi team, working closely with the Quantum Chain team and the Qbao team, has now completed the deployment and testing of token smart contracts on the quantum chain backbone, including the BOT cross-test with the Qbao wallet.  

&amp;nbsp;

**2. Bodhi BOT online exchange**    

* Bodhi BOT will be on the line November 20 exchange, has now been identified with Bigone cooperation, other exchanges to be completed after the docking will be announced in the official website and community.  

* **Bodhi tokens will be November 20 Beijing time at 10:00 on the Bigone and other exchanges on the line transactions, so stay tuned.
Friendly reminder: BOT early will only accept QTUM exchange with the quantum** 

&amp;nbsp;

**3. Bodhi Foundation will sell some BOT**  

* The Bodhi Project team responded positively to the policy in early September by thoroughly refusing tokens for online and offline pre-sale and suspending subsequent crowdfunding programs. The Bodhi Project and the team itself have been steadily evolving and continue to progress as planned.  

* Considering the long-term development needs of the project, Bodhi Foundation (Singapore) will sell 40 million BOTs on the BOT on the Exchange on the BOT, accounting for 40% of the total BOT. Bodhi Foundation BOT pending order price will be 0.4 US dollars, the specific conversion ratio with QTUM will be based on the final pending order price.   

* **The sale will continue from November 20 to December 5, if sold out ahead of time, then ended early**. BOTs for early and private equity investors will be released after the foundation's sale is completed.  

&amp;nbsp;

**4. Bodhi token related to the distribution of instructions**  

* With 100 million BOTs as system tokens in the Bodhi prediction market, BOT holds 100% ownership in Bodhi's forecasted market, with 40% (40 million) in foundations and 60% in communities Ten million).   

* Of the 60% of the community-issued tokens, 5% will be spent on gift coins and airdrops and 15% will be allocated to early angel investors and private placement investors. 40% will be for sale by the Foundation on the exchange.  

* Bodhi will hang on the platform 40% (40 million) BOT, sold out ahead of schedule will end early  

&amp;nbsp;

**5. About the gift money**  

To thank early investors and presale investors for their support of Bodhi, the Bodhi Foundation will distribute 1% (1 million) BOTs to all users who participated in pre-sales in line with the participation quota after the BOT goes online.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Online Pre-sale Users:**   

 Users who previously participated in the BOT pre-sale through the four major platforms of ICOINFO, Allcoin, RenrenICO and Beico, and Bodhi's website will provide website entrance in the future. Users will be claimed by verifying users' mailboxes and quotas on several platforms. Some platforms do not provide user mailbox information. Bodhi will send the BOT to the platform side, and the platform will assist in distributing the bonus coins proportionally.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Offline Pre-Sale and Early Investors:**   
 
 Previously offline pre-launch users and early investors, we will be contacted separately for the bonus.  

&amp;nbsp;

**About airdrop**  

Bodhi as one of the ecologically decentralized quantum chain project, hope BOT can be allocated to all the users of quantum chain as much as possible. Therefore, BOT on-line transactions, the Bodhi Foundation will 4% (4 million) BOT airdrop on the quantum chain.  
 
&amp;nbsp;

**The team will set out to develop an airdrop program. Airdrop program implementation steps are as follows:**  

&amp;nbsp;

1. **Airdrop ratio: Every 100 QTUM will get 4 BOT** 

1. The team will develop an airdrop program and determine the number of blocks to get a blockchain snapshot  

1. The team will announce the number of blocks to the community at least 1 month in advance to remind chain users to put QTUM in their wallet before QTUM blocks, such as QTUM official wallet, Qbao wallet, etc.  

1. After the number of blocks is reached, the user is free to move away from QTUM  

1. The team will get the quantum chain address for all balances in this block count that exceed 1 QTUM  

1. The team tested the airdrop program in the following month and implemented an airdrop  

&amp;nbsp;

Friendly reminder: Before the number of blocks arrives, QTUMs of quantum chain users must be stored in their own wallet, and the QTUMs stored in the exchange's wallet may not get an empty dropped BOT.

But with 5 big wallets winning 24 % of rewards (that would have to be either ICO`s or markets staking)
the number of days has increased so much and chance of staking reward so low, it doesnt cover a very basic running cost.

How will QTUM operate if people start shutting down nodes because is just isnt worth it due to the very large wallets grabbing a majority of rewards?

I was looking at buying QTUM, as per https://buyingqtum.com/, but I believe when that was written the withdrawals from Binance were free. I can't find what the fees on Bittrex are for withdrawals.

Is there an alternative platform people are now using to buy QTUM or is a fee of 0.01 QTUM reasonable?

I have successfully transferred from QTUM Core to my Ledger Nano S. This assumes you are up to date and using QTUM core wallet and have a basic understanding of how to operate the ledger.

1. You install the QTUM app in the Ledger app section, it was at the very bottom.

2. Open up your bitcoin wallet app and then select the QTUM app from your ledger.

3. From the core wallet send to the ledger.

It was damn near instant sending from Core to my ledger!
I'm glad QTUM is getting some love from ledger. S/O to the QTUM team for continuously improving QTUM.

I know things have slowed down on this thread, but do not waiver and lose faith due to price manipulation in the past few weeks and that which may occur in the near future. If you are investing in QTUM right now you understand its INVESTMENT potential long term. not just to turn a quick buck. YOU are the smart investor. below are my thoughts. 

I believe that qtum one day can reach 1/3 the market cap of ethereums current value. This is my predicted evaluation. I'm talking years from now people. i am not one of these noobs saying, ""when moon!?"". If the roadmap and adoption continue it can easily have a marketcap of roughly 10 billion USD in the next 3-5 years. At that time imagine 100 million qtum are in circulation so each qtum would be worth 100 dollars. In that future the network weight would be much higher than today, but you are an early investor and have been investing over time. You average one staking reward every 2 weeks, hell lets say 1 a month. that is 400-800 dollars a month in your pocket consistently as long as qtum retains its value!! Also remember you have been earning staking rewards over that entire time. QTUM to me is the definition of an incredible asset no matter what current price is because i know what it can be worth. staking costs over a month are minimal compared to that return. sure ethereum will be proof of stake in the future but it will be very hard to have enough ethereum to get those results unless you already have a ton. You are early in QTUM and could see a sustained and large return if you play your cards right. 

Have faith and think long term. This is my strategy. If you look at any of the recent ethereum crypto millionaires they believed in it during the ico and stagnant price movements of 6-12 dollars. They new the team, technology, and roadmap were solid. i see the same thing here.

It's very frustrating to get a reward every few days, or every few weeks even. There are worries about interruption of connection or power resetting the staking wallet, or it just not being set up well. For example in other wallets (VRC for example) if I don't get a reward in a few (even if that reward is worth a few cents) then I know something is wrong. 

With QTUM it feels good getting the high rewards, but I would sacrifice that for some constant reassurance that staking is still working, by receiving smaller rewards. I know I'm not the only one thinking this way. Thoughts?

Update: We will begin to moderate posts that have no value, specifically posts and topics about the secondary market. We feel that this type of discussion weakens the Qtum brand, and adds nothing of value to our subreddit. This was an incredibly hard decision for us to make, as most members on the team despise censorship. Even our harshest critics have commended us on our tolerance. If your low quality post about trading gets deleted, please don’t take offence. We will not delete posts criticizing the Qtum project. For the dramatic “Wake up call, get it together"" TL;DR style posts that pop up from time to time, do not expect engagement from Qtum staff.

There has been a recent surge of spambot attacks on this subreddit, we have had to turn on Automoderator and queue posts. This does not mean we are censoring criticism (we approve pretty much everything) but if your post does not make it onto the front page right away, just wait a bit.

Update: We will begin to moderate posts that have no value, specifically posts and topics about the secondary market. We feel that this type of discussion weakens the Qtum brand, and adds nothing of value to our subreddit. This was an incredibly hard decision for us to make, as most members on the team despise censorship. Even our harshest critics have commended us on our tolerance. If your low quality post about trading gets deleted, please don’t take offence. We will not delete posts criticizing the Qtum project. For the dramatic “Wake up call, get it together"" TL;DR style posts that pop up from time to time, do not expect engagement from Qtum staff.

There has been a recent surge of spambot attacks on this subreddit, we have had to turn on Automoderator and queue posts. This does not mean we are censoring criticism (we approve pretty much everything) but if your post does not make it onto the front page right away, just wait a bit.

Usually, there have been about 20 hours between the initial notification and the next stake value change... 

So, even though the ""stake"" value reported by my wallet changed for a short time, that value promptly went back to zero and my ""balance"" regained the value that had been staked.

Here is my informal and slightly trolly response to it:

&gt; UTXOs are unnecessarily complicated, and the complexity gets even greater in the implementation than in the theory. 

Yes, but also no. He goes on about how hard it is to for wallets to figure out which UTXO to spend, etc. I won't deny that this is complicated, it definitely is. However, he doesn't touch at all on how incredibly simple it is on the consensus side to prove a UTXO's balance, and if it is spent or unspent. Fixing clients and interactions is easy, fixing consensus is incredibly hard. So, in Qtum's view, keeping the consensus layer as simple as possible is extremely beneficial, even if that means making the client a bit more complicated.

&gt; This is not purely theoretical; a majority of Bitcoin wallets still fail to make this optimization, essentially nullifying the parallelizability gains of UTXOs versus an account and sequence number model.

This is fair, however, you should notice that Bitcoin does not encourage this optimization he said in any manner. In fact, it somewhat discourages it by making deeply nested chains of unconfirmed transactions invalid on the mempool. Qtum doesn't have a simple answer to this, but there is more to parallizability than parallel execution on the blockchain. In Ethereum it is effectively not possible to generate a transaction offline if the same address is being used for other things. Now, in Qtum there are some stipulations that must be followed, but it is possible. In Qtum you can give some offline wallet a set of known to be unspent UTXOs, and it can spend them and do whatever. In Ethereum, the best you can do is give an account that is promised that it won't be touched. If the account is touched, than any offline transaction generated will be invalid due to the nonce field (sequence number). This means if you have two offline signing devices or something, they will need to be brought online in order to know the appropriate nonce, because one of the other devices could've already used the nonce they thought was valid. 

&gt; there even arises a denial of service vulnerability as an attacker can spam a wallet with small UTXOs whose value is smaller than the marginal fee that is needed to spend them

This has been a handled issue (called dust) in Bitcoin for several years before this article was published. There are still some cases where dust is an issue (or rather, utxos that are just slightly larger than dust), but these utxos take almost as much money to send as they do to spend, and many services have adopted a ""don't make a deposit here that's less than X"" design. Very simple for a high school student to understand I would think. 

&gt; It is clear how UTXOs do not mesh well with stateful smart contracts: ... 

Natively, yes, I agree. And extended details about Qtum's Account Abstraction Layer had just recently been published at the time of his writing, and we were not so popular. 

Basically, if you try to stuff smart contracts into UTXOs, then yes, you're going to have problems. What Qtum has done is to make UTXOs more of a ""message"" to a smart contract that exists on the blockchain. So, when a UTXO is ""spent"" (or well, really more like broadcast, but whatever) it means that the contract has received that message. Contracts still retain their state on the blockchain. It's just that their state is now is some product of the sum of all UTXOs on the blockchain that encoded a message for the contract. This does make some compromises, as order now matters for UTXOs, but this does not greatly compromise our scalability, and in fact with the x86 VM we are considering a true message passing architecture (if we can work out all the kinks) making it so that these UTXOs giving messages to contracts can actually be processed in parallel. 

When you get down to the low level details, an account model is just a slightly abstracted UTXO model with some limitations. Instead of each UTXO being independent, each ""UTXO"" is actually just a nonce number tied to some contract account. Our state model works the same way as Ethereum when you think about it this way. Ethereum contracts don't have a state change until some transaction gives them a message. Qtum contracts are the same way. Ethereum doesn't store actual contract data or anything in it's transactions. Neither does Qtum.

Regardless, the Account Abstraction Layer really allows you to get the best of both worlds on this side. You get a very simple consensus model based on UTXOs, but yet you get the very simple to use and access account model. The AAL still ensures everything is backed by UTXOs, but it presents a very easy to use interface to contract VMs (yes, VMs, we support EVM right now, will support x86 later, and probably many other VMs as time goes)

&gt; one potentially desirable use case is the ability to prevent asset theft by introducing a “recovery key”

All possible in Qtum, including the Solidity code he linked, except for it's backed by UTXOs. (Contracts dictate when their UTXO can be spent thanks to the AAL) 

&gt; In the next major release, Serenity, we are planning an abstraction model that moves this choice down from the protocol level into the EVM

Several months later there was an PR produced that is still undergoing debate: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/208

Serenity has apparently been delayed til 2018 due to some design issues with CASPER or something (which Serenity is suppose to include?)

&gt; essentially a scheme that combines a nonce with a k-bit binary filter that preserves the property that nonces are single-use but allows users to use future nonces ahead of time, allowing up to k transactions to be processed in any order

So here is their solution to the offline transaction problem. I haven't seen any code for this yet, nor a formal EIP of how this would work in theory. Only mentions that it is possible once Serenity is complete. (I think this would fall to contract logic to implement, so unsure how this is suppose to be ""high school level"" stuff)

&gt; [talk about sharding and how it can represent UTXOs]

Like many things in Ethereum such as their yellow paper, this one is a bit over my head. All I know is that sharding is not a magical thing you bolt on to instantly increase TPS. I wish I could find the article, but it basically said that about 1% of contracts are involved in 99% of transactions. (numbers are fudged and made up, but not unrealistic). Sharding can help to scale the entire contract ecosystem, but it can not help to scale a single contract that receives millions of transactions... or any realistic Dapp volume amount that doesn't utilize offchain transactions to their full potential. I think sharding will see only a minor improvement to the current scaling problem in Ethereum, though it may help to keep the network functioning while some big ICO is happening. When that happens, just that one ICO will have scalability problems, and the rest of the network will be doing ok.. unless it has dependencies, which is another big thing not accounted for in this. Given the prevalence of the library pattern and it's shortcomings (see also: Parity hack(s)), I don't think this will be some easy problem to workaround in Etheruem's current ecosystem.

&amp;nbsp; 

Founded in 2004, SolarPlaza was founded by Edwin Koot, a senior expert in photovoltaics. Since its inception, SolarPlaza has been committed to solar photovoltaic power generation, tracking and reporting through the global market trends in solar photovoltaic, launched the forum summit, and gradually establish a one-stop solar energy industry network.   

&amp;nbsp; 

The **Energo Energy Chain** is the first **Qtum** energy industry application to create a peer to peer power trading system by applying a blockchain to the microgrid for decentralized energy autonomy.

&amp;nbsp; 

Currently, the **Energo energy chain** campus micro-grid project in the Philippines has entered the second phase, after which it will continue to expand the scope of the pilot. Meanwhile, at the end of 2017, we will jointly establish more microgrid projects with **government agencies and strategic partners** both at home and abroad, and several Asian countries in Dubai UAE, India and Taiwan as well as Taiwan to stimulate the unlimited potential of the clean energy market in Asia.
  

&amp;nbsp;

In addition, the ****Energo energy chain**** will soon land in European countries such as the Netherlands to broaden the European territory and promote the worldwide decentralization of energy and accelerate the future layout of smart cities.

**Halal Chain System**    
 

**Consensus data processing and storage system**  

* The blockchain platform based on **Qtum** and **Halal-Chain** could realize classified storage of the data collected by the IOT device, of which the consensus data would be stored in the blockchain, while the image data and product data would be stored in the IPFS distributed storage system via the adoption of Meckel tree technology from Ethereum.  

&amp;nbsp;

I**OT data collection system**  

* The core value of the IOT system is that the production information would be automatically collected and uploaded by the IOT device to the blockchain platform without any manual involvement, which could safeguard the uniqueness and credibility of the data.  

&amp;nbsp;

**End user system**  

* As the part linked with end users, the Halal products traceability platform could provide tracing and verifying services, as well as token exchange service.  

&amp;nbsp;

For the Dubai government, this is not just planning but actually putting it into practice, and they hope that Dubai will become the center of the world's blockchain. Just four weeks ago, Dubai government officials announced that "" As of 2020, all Dubai government agencies will use blockchain technology. ""So by 2020 the blockchain will be spread across Dubai, and Halal Chain is one of the key components.  

When Halal Chain joins this ecosystem, it will create a billions of dollars in revenue, and companies from China will also be able to join the economy. Dubai wants to be a global leader in the Halal industry, so the industry-related ecology will be backed by the government.

**Dubai government supports blockchain development Halal Chain is an important part of the plan**

&amp;nbsp;

**Halal Food Sector**  

Halal food sector is the biggest market in the Muslim economy spending over $2 trillion (or 17.7% of the global F&amp;B market) on food and life style. This is further expected to grow $2.5 trillion in 2019.  
 
Moreover, from a list of 70 countries specified in the global halal economy, Malaysia, Dubai and Australia are the champions of halal food suppliers. In terms of halal consumption, Indonesia is ranked at the top with $190.4 billion.  

Halal food logistics acts as a subsidiary to the halal food, though the chemistry of handling halal food is contrary to that of the mass. The halal logistics is another prospective market for businesses which is valued at $151 billion in 2013

For each receiving address, is there any security risk of reusing it to send funds? I know after sending funds out the remaining funds get transfered to a new address automatically, but what if I manually transfer funds back to an address previously being used to send?

**Recently, ObEN, a leader in the Personalized Artificial Intelligence (PAI) in the United States, announced that it will jointly build a blockchain laboratory with QTUM**. 

&amp;nbsp;

**ObEN just completed a round of financing of about $ 14 million A by Tencent, SoftBank, and Yamazaku in June 2017. A year ago, he started to study the application of blockchain technology to make PAI, and became the artificial intelligence common blockchain PAI Innovation partners in the chain.**   

&amp;nbsp;

**Oben** and **Project PAI** think the two hottest IP tech- nologies and blockchains in the tech world are a whole.

&amp;nbsp;

**PAI chain** contains three modules, authentication layer, intelligent network layer and data layer. Its core module is an intelligent network, which applies blockchain computing power to artificial intelligence parallel computing, reducing the cost of artificial intelligence computing, improving efficiency and turning computing power into productivity and more valuable. 
**The PAI chain was co-sponsored by Adam Zheng, ObEN co-founder of Personal AI (PAI) leader.**

&amp;nbsp;

**ObEN** itself will provide **PAI chain** a lot of artificial intelligence computing tasks. **ObEN** for example, builds an artificial intelligence image of the user through personal images and audio uploaded by the user on the **PAI chain**. The artificial intelligence computations required to generate an AI image are assigned to **PAI chain** miners via smart contracts on the **PAI chain**. The miners use the power to complete the task of artificial intelligence tasks like Bitcoin mining process.

&amp;nbsp;

*""The data on the blockchain needs to be learned and refined.If the application on the blockchain does not have an artificial intelligence algorithm to process and execute, it needs a large number of platform companies and middlemen to do it, so it can not achieve decentralization The same time, artificial intelligence requires a large amount of data to be able to progress.*

&amp;nbsp;

*The two are a fusion of the whole, the blockchain is the underlying structure, artificial intelligence is integrated in the underlying structure of the neural network.The blockchain allows users to trust themselves Of the artificial intelligence, the user is willing to contribute data, data fed artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence to give users a variety of artificial intelligence skills for the user services.*

&amp;nbsp;

*Therefore, PAI chain and blockchain is not the same.PAI chain is based on the assets Blockchain.Everyone's data is his own assets, the PAI trained by the data is also his own assets.PAI more, the more artificial intelligence PAI, the higher the PAI chain assets, the higher the value. ""*

*Adam Zheng*

&amp;nbsp;

The technical development of the **PAI chain** is led by Alex Waters. Since 2010, Alex has been involved in the development of Nakamoto's Bitcoin core source code, Bitcoin Core, and is a core member of the Bitcoin blockchain original algorithm. He also founded Coin.co, a Bitcoin payment company, and Coin Validation, a Bitcoin due diligence company",NA,"7jz6xx",NA,0,NA,"false",1515333703,"false","self","t5_3ilam","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/Qtum/comments/7jz6xx/tencent_led_the_artificial_intelligence_project/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,1

The qtum folder was backed up to my external drive but before i did that i did a little syncing with the blockchain.
I put my coins to this address but hell i can't unlock with my passphrase.
Is there any software that i can use to bruteforce my wallet.I will test on offline pc only.

We've already passed NEO in terms of actual smart contract usage and DAPP interest, even though they've been around for 2 years longer.  As of the last couple days Ethereum is now running at capacity and we are poised to start capturing the spill over in demand.  90% of Crypto Devs want to build EVM related projects as this is the largest ecosystem by a huge margin and where 90%+ of the investment flows into.  Porting those projects to QTUM is a relatively easy task and allows devs to continue to work with the EVM while giving their projects the the transaction capacity they need to succeed and giving them access to the mobile market.  As Ethereum fees ramp up the pressure to start using QTUM will grow.  Just look at how [LTC finally gained some traction when BTC filled up](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactions-btc-ltc.html#6m#log) and caused its price to grow by multiples.  IMO there is no other blockchain positioned as well as QTUM to capture this spill over demand from ethereum because of how easy it is to port over a project.  I'm not expecting demand to double over night, but I am saying ethereum being at capacity is the catalyst to drive fundamental growth in the coming months.

2. In Quantum's roadmap, there will be an Quantum Enterprise Alliance. It has not been for official so far, but I believe it will become official soon. It is based on what Patrick said during his visiting couple of days ago. He did mention about 1 billion user company.

3. UBTC (United Bitcoin) Airdrop
It is official comments from market, that 100 Qtum will get 1 UBTC  which we can do simple math. (1UBTC = $400 --&gt; $4 of free money for all qtum holder)
Even the information has been spread out, Qtum price has not been changed that much. But I believe it is because of lack of information for other people. Sooner or later, people will know it and then the price will go up.
Comparing Bitcoin (around 17,000 USD), Qtum (around 14 USD) has best ratio to get UBTC (ten times higher than Bitcoin!)

These transactions are in the mempool, but will not be mined in the default configuration. We have been in contact with Ledger about this, but thus far no ETA on when this will be fixed. 

As a workaround until this is fixed, we request all stakers to temporarily allow mining of low-fee transactions. You can allow low fee transactions by giving these arguments to qtumd upon startup (similar to things like -logevents, etc) 

    -minrelaytxfee=0.0001 -blockprioritysize=1000000 -blockmintxfee=0.0001

Simply start qtumd using these options and unlock your wallet as usual for staking. If just 10% of the staking weight uses this, it should completely mitigate the Ledger problem. Of course, we still recommend using Qtum Electrum rather than the Ledger wallet at this time to avoid this issue in the first place.

I am invested in QTUM for the technology but I am baffled by lack of marketing seen so far. There are many projects that will get lost in the ""noise"" of this space if they don't have differentiators. Marketing/perception matters. There is $300B in this space, and not everyone is a developer and reads every whitepaper. Getting those people to notice your coin should be critical for overall growth.


Look at NEO. NEO is a joke (technology wise) to QTUM. Yet they have killer marketing. I will never own it just because I think the tech is sub-optimal and QTUM is superior. But QTUM with branding is best of both worlds (tech AND marketing) and would crush NEO in the future.


Developers develop. That’s what they do best. Hire marketers. Focus on your strengths and let them handle this part. But don’t make the mistake of thinking this does not matter. People like me will always support the tech. But there are hundreds that can't or don't understand that value proposition and the marketers job is to help them understand the vision (and tech) of QTUM


**Jordan Earls responded with:**


&gt;The biggest marketing problem with Qtum is an intrinsic one. It requires a ton of details to explain what Qtum is and why it matters, because we are so new. We've built something reasonable we could finish. So that means we didn't market ourselves on promises like ""we'll achieve 100 billion transactions per second.. eventually"". Having our network already launched and working is of course a big achievement, but ""it's working"" is much less exciting than a whitepaper saying that we might accomplish world peace 5 years from now. Right now crypto news is flooded with news of the latter type that is basically just pure hype with very little substance and it tends to drown us out. 


&gt;Either way, we have multiple marketing people talking with journalists and such every day, as well as working on outreach projects and articles and such to try to condense all these details into something concise that regular people can understand. It's still hard though, especially when no one cares about all of our achievements in our infrastructure and such and ask basic questions like ""well if I can use EVM here or in Ethereum, why use it in Qtum?"".. of course the answer to that is better mobile and IoT integration, but the point is that people don't read that far. They see the 1 sentence summary and move on to something with more hype that they think might have a price increase in a day or two. From the beginning we were against building hype for the purpose of hype and market effects. We are a long term project with no interest in devaluing our long-term vision for short-term gains. 


&gt;It will be much easier to market this with all of the more exciting stuff coming next year. Between lightning networks and the x86 VM, we'll have a much stronger 1 sentence summary to approach people with. However, we are also working to hire more marketing people and to refresh some stuff about our image while all of this is developed. And of course we will continue to push marketing stuff as it comes in, like new partnerships and Dapps. But we've only had our main network launched for like 3 months now. That might seem like forever in this space, but all of the projects that we tend to get compared to have multiple years of a functioning network and collective mindshare and outreach. We'll catch up to them eventually, and we're on a very fast trajectory for that already, but it still takes time and doesn't happen in just 1 month.


Reading his response to the poster it truly reaffirms my belief that QTUM is a long term hold and I plan to continue staking my coins. I admire the candid answer and a pragmatic response to a question most core developers would likely ignore. It’s a balance of both sides, and shows very thoughtful leadership.

I sent some qtum out from my mainnet wallet for first time and it reduced my remaining staking balance amount by approx 20% more than the coins I actually sent out. That said, my wallet balance on qtum qt shows no abnormal reduction in coins. But, Looking at the transaction on qtum insight explorer, it shows my full balance reduced by the extra 20% which was sent to an address with no other transactions on it. Is this simply part of the POS system where it withholds some number of extra coins from your account when you execute a withdrawal? And then is returned to your account and normalizes your staking balance after 501 confirmations?
I'm just learning my way around the tech and would really appreciate in insights to how this works.

I read the guide on staking through VPS from the qtum site, but Im still to dumb to realize how safe this is from a security standpoint.

If Im setting up a wallet on a computer somehwere else how can i be sure they arent monitoring the inputs I give it?  It seems like they could just have a software that logs everything I type and get  my password without much problem.  

Is anyone else staking through a VPS?  

My home internet goes out randomly.  Would it still be worth it to try from my home internet as long as I get it back up quickly or do you lose your place in line every time you disconnect?

This is the type of interface that will allow main stream adoption. Simple, intuitive and easy to use.

I'm looking forward to the dex release in July next year.

&amp;nbsp;

In recent years, cyber attacks have become increasingly rampant as technology and consumer demand escalate. For the current blockchain enterprises, the maintenance of network threats and data security systems is a very important challenge.

&amp;nbsp;

**In the fiery situation in the area of ​​blockchain, security problems are highlighted**

&amp;nbsp;

From 2104 to 2017, with trepidation of the coin MtGox, as a result of hacking, a total of 744,000 bitcoin theft as a starting point, a number of cyber security incidents have occurred, the blockchain industry, the serious network security incidents , Is a growing number of hackers have been targeting the field of digital currency and blockchain, which undoubtedly sounded the alarm for the digital currency exchange and blockchain project initiator!

&amp;nbsp;

It is extremely important to improve the security of the blockchain and increase consumer confidence in the embedded blockchain technology. The strategic cooperation between **QBAO** network and **Hacken**, one of the top network security teams in the world, is an important measure for **QBAO** network to enhance product safety.

 This cooperation Both parties combine trusted computing with blockchain technology to provide reliable network security control for the blockchain. So that each wallet will benefit from verifiable hardware-based multi-factor authentication and will be able to safely display the transaction details of the transaction order in order to enhance the security of the wallet and safeguard the interests of the user chain.

&amp;nbsp;

**Focus on user experience, international collaboration to provide optimal security blockchain**

&amp;nbsp;

**QBAO** network is based on blockchain social applications, with a unique decentralized decentralized technology, highly secure encryption services make social more smoothly, **Qbao** network includes both the mobile terminal, but also includes the desktop, all kinds of web System and browser plug-in, the goal is to create blockchain based social circles. At present, the active users have exceeded 300,000.

 It is also based on the **QTUM** blockchain technology and supports the functions of BTC, ETH, **QTUM** and other mainstream high-quality currencies such as mobile wallet, red envelopes and transfer functions, making transactions and chatting as simple and quick as possible! **Qbao** network aims to serve global blockchain users. **Qbao** network will open up various blocks of digital currency wallets, trading, payment, dapp shops and social networking to create a complete eco-platform for blockchain applications.

&amp;nbsp;

*""At present, the status quo of network information security is that there have been a large number of user tokens being stolen in the world as well as in China. Along with the rapid development of blockchain technology and applications.*

*Our network security is very lagging, QBAO network and the international top network security team Hacken strategic cooperation, we look forward to it can become a block chain security barrier across the cyberspace, qbao also hope to provide a safe and reliable products, to ensure that The security of digital assets for everyone, for more applications to provide protection, but also for our QBAO products provide absolute security, we have always focused on user experience, it will be our focus to overcome the area. ""*

*QBAO CEO Chen Lin* 

&amp;nbsp;

**1 + 1 is greater than two, the top block chain business cooperation, leading the trend of security**

&amp;nbsp;

In the financial services industry, blockchain platforms are being used in the U.S. and European capital markets, as are markets such as Japan. Given the conservative and highly regulated nature of the industry, blockchain has the potential to reshape cybersecurity, and while the cybersecurity industry has not yet fully embraced the blockchain, at this time startups such as blockchain and digital currency exchanges such as However, many SMEs are incapacitated to set up a complete security team.

There are many stolen incidents, so this project basically can not operate normally. This time, the strategic cooperation between **QBAO** network and **Hacken** can be as follows: **QBAO** users provide absolute security protection, **QBAO** network can also be more energy used in the blockchain code and product development work.

&amp;nbsp;

**Hacken** is an international top-level security team ""active"" in the area of ​​blockchain targeting technology companies in all blockchain industries as well as white-hat hacker communities that provide blockchain businesses with a secure and dependable foundation through the creation of the **Hacken Cybersecurity Ecosystem Technical support** and preparedness plans, while serving White Hat communities, **Hacken** as a token, providing paid technical assistance, vulnerability search, program development and some other related ecological development services.

&amp;nbsp;

*""As a bridge between community-based blockchain community and the Internet, Hacken cooperates with top Chinese companies in order to let Hacken QBAOnetwork's achievements and progress in product development are welcome. We are very optimistic about the prospects of QBAOnetwork. Cooperation is a win-win ""* 

*Hacken co-founder Dmytro Budorin*

&amp;nbsp;

**In the area of ​​blockchain, the application value of safety technology continues to rise**

&amp;nbsp;

While banking, finance and real estate are at the forefront in this area, even the education, social and security sectors are being hit by blockchain startups. Blockchain technology and network security are inherently linked, after all, blockchain technology is encryption and security after decades of research breakthroughs, blockchain technology provides a completely different way to store information, transactions, build trust, so the blockchain special It is suitable for the environment with higher safety requirements.

&amp;nbsp;


With the convenience of internet payment and mobile payment for the majority of users, the rapid development of blockchain technology and the adoption of multiple signature verification and other technical means can not only create super security, but also prevent fraud, such as fraud , Repeated payments, driving up prices. Through smart contract technology will provide more security, historically technology has been an important factor in promoting industrial change. The application of blockchain in the real-world business community can be described as the overall situation.

&amp;nbsp;

As the top social platform and wallet products based on blockchain technology in China, **QBAO** network can provide a very good model for the traditional application of blockchain technology. Traditional enterprises need to accept new technologies and scenarios Technology brought about by the change.

&amp;nbsp;

On the eve of changes in the global financial system, financial innovation businesses such as P2P net loans, crowdfunding, online payment and digital currency have also been established with new technologies such as blockchain technology, cloud computing and big data. Great value in the field. The original network security technology has lagged behind the pace of financial innovation, the concept of broad ""security"" by financial practitioners more attention. The security of financial business will provide a vast space for the development of security entrepreneurs and will surely be chased by investors.

&amp;nbsp;

As of now, **Qbao** network, the leading wallet application in the area of ​​blockchain, has launched the first version of the digital currency wallet, and in subsequent releases **Qbao** will also support more digital currencies such as BTC, BCH and more. This means that **Qbao** will use cross-link technology to connect and expand different blockchain in order to realize value network.

&amp;nbsp;

In other words, the user's digital assets are no longer just a number in the centralized database, but real, digital assets recorded in the blockchain can not be tampered with and truly belong to the user.",NA,"7mro4w",NA,0,NA,"false",1515389353,"false","self","t5_3ilam","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/Qtum/comments/7mro4w/qtum_dapp_qbao_network_and_ukraine_network/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

 Considering how big the halal market is and literally 0 marketing from the team. This ico could moon very easily anytime with a newspaper article. Considering its only been out for 3days, I'm pretty bullish I could see it going 10x before end of January.

Secure and Tokenize Your Personal Data
 
Robin8 is launching a Blockchain based profile utility token (PUT) project to give control of the profile back to the owner and empower the user with their own data. The company has officially announced its pre-sale for its token sale and plans to announce its token sale later this month. 
 
PUT connects advertisers, publishers, creditors, companies and other consumers. In the Robin8 blockchain marketplace and ecosystem, when a buyer wants access to data, they will pay the data owner (consumer, influencer, content creator). Similarly, if an advertiser wants content or people to view their content, they will pay the content creator, or pay the people to view and share their content. The same rules will apply if the consumer wants access to premium content, the consumer will have to pay the content creator. On the supply side of the Robin8 marketplace, the recipient can be paid in token and keep for future appreciation or redeem for cash. 
 
Robin8, the leading influencer search engine and marketplace in China, profiles, ranks and matches advertisers to influencers with the use of big data and AI.  The company is the first platform in China that allows anyone to understand their social data from a wide range of social media sites. In addition to improving advertiser’s ROI, the company provides an automated system for tracking, transparency, third-party digital advertising verification, social media and e-commerce measurement, and data management.
 
Founded in 2015, Robin8 has an existing platform, growing global client base and growing revenue. To date, the company has profiled over 30 million users from across 13 social media platforms, has acquired over 250,000 users in its app and marketplace store and has completed over 5,000+ influencer campaigns with the likes of Macys, Unilever, among other brands. The company has raised over $3M USD from leading venture capitalists including VFortune, Triumph Capital, Linear VC, 365, MyTech Venture Capital, Pre-Angel and SOS Ventures. The company is founded by leading experts in big data, digital media, PR, marketing and AI. To get to know their management team please visit https://en.robin8.net/team.

My wallet has been trying to synch for 3 weeks now. I have upgraded twice to newer versions. I have also deleted the QTUM core and re downloaded it. What else can I do to get this thing to work on my computer?

I am not too tech savvy, and am largely unsure about any of this. When I deleted my QTUM core I simply put that in the trash folder in my computer and deleted it. When I downloaded it again all my files seemed to be there (ie. it had my coin balance on that wallet without me having to apply my .dat file), so I have a feeling I didn't completely delete my QTUM files? 

Anyways, this issue has been bugging me for awhile, and I just have no idea where or who to go to to resolve the issue. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Looking at [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=qtum,neo%20cryptocurrency) tells the whole story clear as day and apparently that previous article was accurate.  **NEO has ZERO interest in the East** and it’s only popular in the West, while **QTUM is primarily popular in the East** and not that popular in the West.


What am I missing here? Why is it people are saying NEO is Chinese Ethereum? Putting tribalistic tendencies aside it seems to me the harder “metrics” (exchange volume/interest/dapps/partnerships/advisors) favor QTUM. Everyone who calls NEO chinese ethereum, at least from what I can tell, is from the west - do they just have superior marketing?

 I've read the unofficial instructions several times over and while I understand some of the basics, I dont know how to stake. I'm not very tech savy and dont understand coding really so making a contract as well as staking feel kind of beyond me.

How do you earn coins? do you just leave your wallet open all day while it processes blocks and hope for the best to get a coin that someday will  mature? Or do you need to get coins first for them to mature.

I'm pretty much up to 72k in blocks but havent been rewarded or anything(wallet is also unlocked ). I mean I get I need to have coins first  that will eventually mature...but here is where I'm kind of lost.

I'm also on a win32 computer so that limits me in a few areas of more recent wallets that accept multiple currencies.

* Am I able to consolidate those accounts?
* Am I able to send the qtums from one address to the other without fees?

https://www.docdroid.net/MMAIi2k/mainnet-results-staking-faq-october-1-8.pdf#page=7

Please correct me if I'm wrong:

- Amount of QTUMs in wallet &lt; 10000 
Splitting can increase your overall staking performance
--&gt; splitting up in chunks of 250 - 400 QTUM

Question 1: what happens if you split up in chunks of 200QTUM? 


- Amount of QTUMs in wallet &gt; 10000 
Splitting will most likely increase your overall staking performance

Question 2: splitting up in chunks of 250 - 400 QTUM as well?


or e.g. 

I. in Junks of 1000 QTUM 

II.  in Junks of 200 QTUM

III.or mixing eg some 200 QTUM, some 250 QTUM, some 1000 QTUM?

Question 3:

If all the QTUMs are in the same Wallet (just different addresses) I expect to have the same time tg earn rewards (eg. 5 days) or will splitting increase the anticipated time to earn eg. to 10 days determined by the size of the smaller chunks?

So my assumption would be: as long as the entire amount is in the same wallet the time to earn rewards stays the same regardless how many splits to different addresses are involved. The only advantage is that multiple block rewards will be posible, am I right?


Question 4:

What's the best way to split?
Is it create in GUI new receiving addressses and simply sent an amount to them?
However how can one be sure that the amount to transfer isn't taken from an already splitted amount? e.g. 500 QTUM and 250 QTUM --&gt; transfer 250 to a new adress should result in 250 / 250 /250 and not 300/200/250 


Question 5: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/7f2287/splitting_transactions_for_staking/ mentiones that a Command line command sendtomanywithdupes can be used for splitting. How to use it properly?

Thank you!

There are quite a few sites showing crypto prices and related data, but I still felt it could be done better. So I worked 3 months with a friend of mine to create [CoinVision.io](https://coinvision.io/).

We tried to have a fast, mobile friendly frontpage and we think allowing you to star your favorite coins is very useful. Prices update automatically and in real-time as we pull data straight from 36+ exchanges (grows by the day). Finally we put a lot of work in the portfolio and alerting system, although it is still arguably far from perfect.

We'd love to hear some honest feedback!

A community of socially active individuals collaborating to build unique experiences together is what CFun intends to achieve by building an ecosystem of intellectuals who both profits from their community efforts in building projects together and develop themselves with the new found experiences.

CFun already has an established proof-of-concept for CoGC (Collaboratively Generated Content) working in China, they intend to explore the blockchain opportunities for this venture by leveraging the network to build a sophisticated pool of autonomous content generators who work in groups to birth their quality IP products.

Intellectual Property Problems

Every facet of human existence has a trace of quality human endeavour birth through creative thinking and manipulation of data constructs within the environment.

The market demand for intellectual property is high and there are few people who actually profit from this often overlooked industry – and they do so to a large degree, typically making a lucrative sum.

Organizations are looking for unique catchphrases or branding techniques to associate their business capable of leaving an indelible positive remark in the minds of their clientele’s.

The number of IPs that are undervalued counterbalances the high demand score, however, due to the monopolized market structure of IPs, there are just few people who actually deliver and are considered ‘top class’ in rating, while other undervalued genuine and original IP contents should be worth much more than they are awarded.

Once a community fan-base works together, they are able to generate genuine content that relates to their favorite vendor or service provider; however, because of the lack of benchmark protocols to assess the quality of these service creation, there are little or no rewards to compensate the efforts put forth as a product of their IP.

The bulk of the content creation has been left entirely to branding, advertising and design companies; who now serve as middle-men between ingenious creative ideas and the companies who demand them.

These intermediaries tend to be more influential and oftentimes swing the tides of negotiations in their favour. More so, these intermediaries function to make a profit despite the quality of IPs and to the detriment of a client’s taste and varieties.

Due to the challenges involved in securing the best content creators and the cost in having a variety to choose from, oftentimes, SMEs and content creators are driven far apart from each other and further away from achieving an optimal relationship

CFUN’s Ecosystem Solution

CFun seeks to create an ecosystem that expands the function and reach of this industry by transforming the IP service orientation.

Through collaborative and collective project building skills, users of the platform can develop proprietary products that meet the current demand and standard of already established business ventures.

CFun will delocalize the IP concept and make the returns readily available to its subscribers allowing them to profit from the niche – financially and otherwise.

CFun will breach the gap in service satisfaction by creating an ecosystem and creating a standard that forms a benchmark across other existing and developing platforms using its proprietary algorithm software to evaluate IP content and quality.

Furthermore, it will use its ecosystem to form a bridge between companies and brands looking for a new concept for promotional purposes, and also create financial opportunities for content creators.

At the nursery stage of the blockchain integration of CoGC, the platform will perfect creative writing and then move on to other forms of art.

The major feature of CFun’s ecosystem is the ‘content’, orbited by the creator, the reader and the buyer; the association works to contribute value to the object created and adding revenue opportunities for the content creator through assessment by the readers. Also, CFun has a scale to measure the quality of IP contents.

&amp;nbsp;

As India's leading offline energy agency, the organization focuses on four major areas: policy, finance, skills training, and technology innovation

&amp;nbsp;

**CLEAN** was formed by India's 12 most crucial leaders in the decentralized energy industry to provide affordable, green energy for areas that total more than 300 million people and are unable to connect to the nation's main power grid. The partnership with the organization also means that **Energo** will work hand-in-hand with **CLEAN** to bring a variety of microgrid-based clean energy to India using transparent and decentralized technology. 

&amp;nbsp;

**This partnership gives Energo an opportunity to work with more than 100 leaders from all walks of life in India to improve energy transmission efficiency in India's rural and urban poor areas.**

&amp;nbsp;

In addition, by working with **CLEAN**, **Energo** can conduct surveys of the viability of clean energy in rural and urban India, deploying local energy transactions, smart meters and smart energy solutions. At this stage, **Energo** is embarking on a project to deploy local micro-grid and rooftop energy receiving equipment in the first quarter of 2018, and its partners will also participate in the project to carry out on-site analysis and survey and equipment operation and maintenance.

&amp;nbsp;

*""Our goal is to deploy Energo's DAE ecosystem throughout Asia so it is imperative for Energo to do so,""*

*""We are looking forward to working with CLEAN, We hope that both sides will jointly carry out a series of projects to decentralize clean energy to promote the green, decentralized and efficient energy in India. ""*

Yang Kai-kai, Energo Labs COO.

&amp;nbsp;

More than 500 million people in India have been supplied with electricity since 2000, an average of 100 million a year on average. As one of the major drivers of global energy trends, India is seeking 100% electrification nationwide by 2020. 

&amp;nbsp;

The local government has set a target of hoping to produce 100GW of solar energy by 2022, and in the past five years, the electricity price of solar power in India has been cut in half.

&amp;nbsp;

**The formal agreement between Energo and CLEAN will help the Indian government to apply the blockchain technology to off-grid micro-grid construction, speed up government's planning and improve the technical content of India's grid in a short period of time 100% of residents receive safe and efficient power supply. As Yang Kai-kai said, such a partnership is imperative!**",NA,"7jzxj9",NA,0,NA,"false",1515334084,"false","self","t5_3ilam","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/Qtum/comments/7jzxj9/energo_labs_signs_strategic_partnership_with/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

I am following the process of changing my ERC20 tokens to actual QTUM, and I having some problems.

I'm doing it with Changelly. I had to do two conversion, to send the tokens from two accounts. One of them seems to be in the process, as it has been around two days in the ""Burning out"" phase.

The other one, though, didn't detect my transaction, which is this:

Actually, I was converting 297.9 ERC20 tokens, but in the error page it says it were 297.84999999 QTUM; I don't know if it's related.

The online advertising industry faces big challenges, especially in the form of fake data. The internet economy is vast, and traditionally adopts a laissez-faire style marketplace to purchase advertising. Fake news is a hot buzzword lately, with governments and social media platforms struggling to stay neutral, while protecting consumers from misleading information. Opinions vary on how to tackle this issue, or whether it’s a problem at all. Some suggest that it’s up to the consumer to inform themselves before opening their wallets, while others believe in preventative measures. Regardless, it would be hard to argue that anyone should use misleading information to obtain profit or influence.
To make matters worse, the intellectual property of consumers can be used, or outright stolen by third parties. This type of behavior leaves the advertiser (the person paying for the service) leery of spending, when they have no way to confirm that their ‘engagements’ are being targeted properly, or at all.

**Enter Robin8**

The Robin8 Blockchain project seeks to give control of the profile back to the owner and empower the user with their own data. This is accomplished by utilizing the Robin8 Artificial Intelligence engine, which profiles and ranks users based on their reach. Social networks like Google and Facebook are notorious for monetizing people as the product, which they use to place targeted advertisements.
In the Robin8 blockchain marketplace and ecosystem, when a buyer wants access to data, they will purchase Robin8 PUT tokens to pay the data owner (consumer, influencer, content creator). Similarly, if an advertiser wants content or people to view their content, they too will purchase Robin8 tokens to pay the content creator for the content, or to pay the people to view and share their content. The same rules will apply if the consumer wants access to premium content, the consumer too will have to purchase Robin8 tokens to pay for the content creator. On the supply side of the Robin8 marketplace, the token recipient that is paid the Robin8 can redeem their Robin8 coins for cash or keep for future appreciation.


Users earn tokens by improving their trust within the ecosystem. They do this by binding their social profiles to the Robin8 Blockchain. Every action on this profile is recorded in the Blockchain, be it an article that was read, or sharing something like a video. This also can help verify the authenticity of the user. Blatant botting is combatted by the Robin8 engine, which is fine tuned to recognize automated (or fake) social media profiles.

&amp;nbsp;

Recently, the world's first distributed risk hedging blockchain **FORTUNA** plans officially announced that it will release QRC20 Token on the platform and receive **QTUM** during the financing phase. In addition, **FORTUNA** will also open up a new generation of OTC derivatives trading system along with **QTUM**.

&amp;nbsp;

*""We are very pleased to receive the help and support of the QTUM, China's top blockchain ecosystem, before the formal launch of the FORTUNA platform, enabling FORTUNA to get down to the ground more quickly,""*

*Brian, founder of  FORTUNA.*

&amp;nbsp;

Currently, the Asia-Pacific market headed by China has enjoyed the fastest growth, the largest scale and the highest share in the mainstream derivatives market in the past decade. Despite the booming period, China's risk hedging market still faces many challenges and bottlenecks compared with mature markets such as North America.

&amp;nbsp;

The **FORTUNA** plan will effectively address the current huge credit risk in OTC derivatives markets through asymmetric encryption, distributed consensus, smart contracts and digital assets in the blockchain technology system, with low operational efficiency and insufficient contractual liquidity , The contract category is limited and other core issues.

&amp;nbsp;

**QTUM** is pleased to support **FORTUNA**, which has been impressed with innovations in the areas of mobility-constrained issues and engine design, etc. **QTUM**  hope for the underlying blockchain technology support and development for **FORTUNA** Experience can help with its rapid arrival.

&amp;nbsp;

*""I believe FORTUNA and QTUM can be together to create a balanced, efficient, high liquidity mature over-the-counter derivatives trading system, the real use of blockchain Technology offers a large number of emerging investment options for more people. ""*

*Patrick Dai*

&amp;nbsp;

**The key members of the FORTUNA team are from famous universities such as Yale University, Columbia University, University of Chicago, Oxford University, McKinsey, OCC, Nomura, Microsoft, Alibaba and Huawei. Believe that FORTUNA and QTUM combination will use the more mature blockchain technology in the field of investment to open up a new world.**

https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/7kfm72/adding_tokens_in_qtum_core_wallet/

And my contribution in this post 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/7mb7o3/different_qtum_fees_per_tx_depending_on_input/

I have just executed a heap of contract call to send my ink and qbao tokens to my qbao app.

I have found the following -

The contract will not send less then 1 ink

When staking, the contract will execute then say the address you sent the tokens from has mined a block. From past experience these blocks don't pay out the 4qtum reward. This has happened 3 times,  2x I'm now waiting on but dont expect any reward.

While this block is false mining you cant send any more tokens out of the address. The contract just fails, taking the tx fee of 0.1051633qtum

The contract execution fee is 0.1051633qtum, no matter how you set the gaslimit and gaseprice.

These contract glitches have cost me around 6x 0.1051633ptum through failed contract executions.

I have chased the qtum devs in my first post above and got no response. I just had to sort things out without them. I would be very glad if they acknowledge this information as its nearly cost me 1qtum to figure it out so far and i still havent sent all the tokens out yet. There could be a few more failed contract calls to come yet.

Qtum devs, please look into this issue.

Can you send tokens from a staking wallet?

Are my points given above real issues, and will they be fixed?

Is the contract call fee of 0.1051633qtum set into the future? It seems very expensive and likely to be a future failing in the qtumtoken economy.

Thanks

More than 72 hours ago I sent my entire qtum holdings to a Q-address (on binance) and they're still stuck in an ""unconfirmed"" transaction. 

I will pay the amount (40%of the tx) if I can recover the asset. Ideally, the person would prepare a detailed guide on how to cancel the transaction or push it through.  The only thing I've ever coded was ""hello world"" back in 2004 so the guide/video would have to be understandable to a non-programmer.

The transaction was Qtum(mainnet NOT ERC20) sent from a ledger nano S through the Ledger bitcoin wallet app. When sending the tx I selected the ledger's ""high transaction fee"" but it seems it wasn't enough. I can supply logs, the tx id etc. 

I contacted the devs but they haven't been very responsive, I'm sure they have plenty on their plates but I need my assets back. 

If you can help me please contact me via pm. 

Thanks.

Recently, Banca received Qtum support. Qtum and Banca hit it off to reach a strategic cooperation that will work together on the road to subversion.**

&amp;nbsp;

**Banca** is the name of the world's first bank, meaning the new beginning of the financial industry. The **Banca** team seeks to replace traditional investment banks with community investment banks, replace centralized decisions by financial elites with community-based smart decision-making, and leverage big data and artificial intelligence technologies to create a new, lower cost and more efficient system in the blockchain.

&amp;nbsp;

**Banca** community, like Wall Street, has a variety of financial institutions, independent trader, analysts, lawyers and so on. The various parts work together to form the Wall Street ecosystem, and **Banca** is like an investment bank community built on the blockchain.

&amp;nbsp;

**Banca is a decentralized and intelligent community investment bank**


&amp;nbsp;

In order to prevent all kinds of moral hazard caused by the centralized management of traditional investment banks, **Banca** constructed a business protocol, trust mechanism and incentive system based on blockchain technology. With the development of digital currency in the past few years, the technology of blockchain has been initially developed and is being applied more and more to all walks of life except digital currencies, which will bring new benefits to the investment banking industry Opportunities.

&amp;nbsp;

**Banca** eco-chain system will use artificial intelligence and smart contracts for automated management. Non-tamper-proof features based on blockchain, as well as automatic execution of smart contracts when conditions trigger, greatly ensure the credibility of smart contracts and reduce implementation costs and compliance costs.

&amp;nbsp;

The **Banca** team has more than a decade of practice in the fields of big data analytics and intelligent robot investment and brings these experiences to **Banca's** community service. This will enable community investment banks to more accurately recommend relevant service providers to customers, provide more useful information to specific customers and information for listed clients to more effectively connect with investors and improve the service efficiency of **Banca**. At the same time, by combining the technologies of artificial intelligence, This process will continue to self-improvement.

&amp;nbsp;

The investment bank community consists of four components. One of the primary markets includes listing, debt issuance, mergers and acquisitions, and digital asset securitization. Secondary market communities include digital asset research, ratings and digital asset management. The OTC digital financial services area includes financial derivatives, liquidity management, risk management and digital asset custody. The basic service area includes legal services, accounting / auditing and other related service providers.

&amp;nbsp;

All primary and secondary market projects will keep track of performance on the platform and record the data to the blockchain for continuous dynamic analysis. Based on the original service providers' compliance with each project point of view and then to the service providers Rate. Service providers can upgrade their rank in the community by getting high project ratings, subjective star ratings from investors, and continuing access to services to make the community more popular.

&amp;nbsp;

High-level service providers can get higher service fees in follow-up services, and a higher proportion of the project is divided into bonuses. Similarly, every time investors use the platform docking services, but also will accumulate experience and enhance the level, in order to obtain various benefits.

&amp;nbsp;

All in all, **Banca** is not a cold technology, but a living community. In addition to exerting technological advantages, the **Banca** team will also carefully manage the concept of community and make the residents of the community ""live and work in peace"" in order to continuously improve the popularity and service efficiency of the community.

&amp;nbsp;

As for the progress of the project, the **Banca** team has successfully contacted many service providers and currency circle investors and got a good response. And also successfully developed a number of seed applications, the future will be applied to the platform services. 

&amp;nbsp;

Such as the CoinAI digital currency quantitative analysis, mid-term forecasting and asset allocation system. Community members can use CoinAI to easily analyze the digital token market and compare the investment value and risk of different currencies. Obtain the prediction of the future trend of tokens based on the artificial intelligence and big data timing models. Customers demonstrate their risk appetite and can easily build the best portfolio with just one click.

However staking performance didn't improve. Theoretically it should be possible to stake overlapping (address A is on stake and cools off - address B receives another stake with 0.4 QTUM the same time)


Maybe I did something wrong or understood something wrongly. I splittet my wallet the following way: create new receiving addresses and transfer locally from address A to B, C D and so on (with input select). Now all my addresses contain the same amont of QTUM.

So a few weeks ago I received a message from my friend saying that I should go to QTUM foundation (a scam site) in order to get my United bitcoin form the previous snapshot.

Thinking it was legit because my friend told me and I am new to QTUM I actually thought the QTUM foundation was a legit site. I entered my information  which involved going to the console and entering ""dumpprivkey"" and then entered it into the scam site. However I might have done this wrong as a bunch of random numbers came up/letter came up and the site said that it didn't work and to try again later.

2 days later to my horror I found out that the ""QTUM foundation"" was a scam site and not from the QTUM team. 

Luckily all my coins were safe and I transferred them. I then encrypted my wallet, which was previously unencrypted.

This leads me to some questions that I would be really appreciative if you could help me with.

1. Are private keys the same as encryption keys? ie since I didn't have encryption up does that mean if I leave encryption on I will be safe?

2. after the airdrop of United bitcoin (as I might need this wallet where the snap shot took place). If I delete my wallet and re-download it, will it be a new wallet or just reinstalling my old wallet? 

3. If you were in my situation what would you do to be safe? I would preferably like to keep my QTUM wallet on my main computer but I do have a 4 year old laptop if necessary. As I would like to be able to Stake and get in on future airdrops such as BOT.

Bonus: I am aware that I screwed up, I feel really bad about it. Honestly I thought I could trust the link I got and since I didn't hear anything from QTUM or United bitcoin I thought it was reasonable.

Production and trading of red wine is a very long-term industrial chain, from the cultivation of grapes to the brewing of red wine, which is then traded until placed on the consumer's table, with a large number of IoT devices underpinned in various scenarios of production and trading The trust between the upstream and downstream of the industry, each link will have a cost, each link will produce a large amount of data. 

How to use the big data of the wine industry to reduce the production and transaction costs of red wine and to provide cheap and cheap products to global wine consumers has become an urgent issue for the wine industry.

&amp;nbsp;

**Wine Chain** is based on the blockchain technology, that is, the use of blockchain technology to decentralization, data can not be tampered with, traceability to promote the development of the wine industry. 

**Wine Chain** tracks and discerns wine production locations, production processes, shipping and selling the entire supply chain.

**Wine Chain** is not limited to wines but also includes all wineries and wine industry services such as real estate, cosmetics, travel, wine finance and more

&amp;nbsp;

At present, there are more than 3 billion people in the world and there is a demand for red wine. However, under the traditional business model, the wine industry faces such problems as traceability of certification, diversification of the global market, high barriers to market entry, difficulties in information flow, and asymmetric information.

 The **Wine Chain** will use blockchain technology to break through these market barriers, co-ordinate the global market, the wine industry will be under the impetus of Wine Chain to produce explosive growth.

&amp;nbsp;

**Wine Chain is the world's first based on QTUM traceability of red wine and wine digital asset applications as one of the cultural social ecosystem**

&amp;nbsp;

**Wine Chain Introduction Video**  

https://v.qq.com/x/page/o0541avfvmz.html?start=34 

&amp;nbsp;

**Wine Chain** is divided into 4 application modules:  

* Product traceability  
* WIC circulation system   

* WID digital assets  
* Social culture promotion   

Where traceability makes full use of the block chain technology, NFC technology and RFID chip technology; WID digital asset transfer wine and other physical assets to Wine Chain, the formation of digital assets for circulation and investment; personalized matching MAP is that consumers can according to their own preferences, the system according to the matching degree automatically push the red wine, make each people can find a suitable wine; social cultural promotion activities, including the establishment of the DAO community and held the wine culture promotion.

SpaceChain is inviting you to join an official AMA on Wednesday 24 January 2018  6:30 pm PST (- 8 GMT) /  10:30 AM (+8 GMT Singapore time Thursday 25 January 2018) and will last for 1 hour. SpaceChain's goal is to integrate blockchain nodes on satellites to add a new dimension to the core framework of distributed ledgers. These node satellites will bring blockchain to space and make use of existing space technology. We’re pioneering a new layer of infrastructure and taking advantage of space resources. SpaceChain is a blockchain platform built on QTum that features data collection, computing, applications, and storage. 

My name is Jeff Garzik and I’m a former Bitcoin core dev. I am working with SpaceChain to bring space technology coupled with blockchain to everyday people at lower costs. (www.spacechain.com) We have put together a great team with partners like Patrick Dai (founder of QTUM), VC Tim Draper, and Andrew Yan.

Our CEO Zhuo Zheng’s AMA transcript on 17th of January 2018 is up https://medium.com/@spacechain 

Looking forward to meeting you all on the 24/25th!

- Due to improve staking performance I split up my QTUM balance to multiple addresses. The medum article says: ""We recommend users collect their QTUM tokens in a single wallet address before Block 93330 to leave time to verify that the balance can be properly queried using the Qtum Explorer.

So my question is: since I know my address/TxId/Ect. from the transfer info from the exchange can I manually input that address as an address of mine? then since I have my private key, can I confirm with the blockchain that that transaction was mine? (I used ""validateaddress myaddress"" for the address in question, which returned ""ismine"": true,)

So is it just the UI of the wallet that isnt fully synced?

My main point is we NEED more attentive moderators and a Dev that can come on once a day and answer some of the more complex questions for people and solve simple problems. 

Vevue has been sticked at the top for a long time. Can we change that? 

Also creation of an actual daily thread so i dont have to post one every day. 

Not trying to be rude, i just want to see things go in the right direction. Also i would gladly be a moderator if someone can approve that. Thank you.

Edit: Since everyone thinks I'm trying to scam I'm gonna let the cat out the bag. Qryptos has qtum listed for a pretty big premium right now. There are buy orders for Qtum for .047eth per qtum and right now all the other markets have qtum listed for .035 eth per coin. The kick is you have to have the old erc20 tokens to sell your coins on qryptos. Whoever has the old coins can literally make 700+ dollars right now buy selling them on qryptos for eth then buying back the same amount of main net coins and keep the eth profit.

&amp;nbsp;

**Halal Chain**, a green food chain dedicated to the traceability of green foods using blockchain technology, not only does **Halal Chain** connect with the entire Halal real estate industry and payment businesses, but also address the realities in Islamic finance Pain points. As the first public chain in the Muslim world, **HalalChain** strives to create a sound ecological chain that serves global users.

&amp;nbsp;

The **space chain** is a space exploration program based on human consensus, committed to the development of space applications and space exploration activities and is looking forward to exploring a consensus mechanism that can effectively mobilize the forces of all mankind to conduct space exploration and eventually realize the direction of human civilization Space dreams.

&amp;nbsp;

**Halal Chain** is based on the Middle East and serves the whole world. The **Space Chain** is a space program that uses space and blockchain technology to better serve the world. Both parties share the same philosophy and development aspirations. In the future, both parties will carry out strategic cooperation based on the principle of mutual support and common development to jointly explore the space-based technology of blockchain technology and will build a worldwide space-based blockchain application network based on **SpaceChain's** space technology.

&amp;nbsp;

At present, **Halal Chain** and **SpaceChain** spaceflight will first cooperate to launch a satellite that will migrate **HalalChain** technology to **SpaceChain** OS and adapt to the satellite platform to validate the **HalalChain** node's space applications.

&amp;nbsp;

**Halal Chain** uses satellites as a blockchain node with **Space Chain** technology, increasing the diversity of blockchain nodes, minimizing the risk of the traditional terrestrial Internet from being viciously attacked and creating a secure space blockchain network while using Blockchain and other encryption methods to achieve secure space data storage. Compared with the simple block-based technology based on terrestrial Internet, the application of terrestrial plus satellite multi-node has the advantages of wider coverage and more application types.

&amp;nbsp;

**Halal Chain** expands Halal industry into space by establishing its first satellite node in space and verifies that it provides cross-border logistics information collection, green food safety traceability and cross-border payment services to all over the world, especially to Middle East countries. Subsequently, more satellite nodes **HalalChain** users to provide better and more efficient services to serve the Middle East logistics, finance and other industries.

&amp;nbsp;

The vision of the **space chain** is to find a consensus mechanism in the field of space exploration that can effectively mobilize the power of all mankind to meet this challenge in the face of great challenges.

&amp;nbsp;

**The space chain tries to solve the following three problems:**


1. The international space cooperation is relatively closed and there is an urgent need in the aeronautical field for a space cooperation alliance that has a consensus mechanism.

1. The aerospace industry is currently closed to the public and space exploration lacks the strength of all fields.

1. The current space project has not found a balance between government and commerciality.

&amp;nbsp;

At present, the international space cooperation is relatively closed. The reason is that the security issue is the biggest concern for cooperation among most countries. The other is the question of interests, which has become the contradiction between commercial companies and state-owned companies. Therefore, establishing a cross-border, safe space security alliance that can protect the interests of participants in the field of aerospace will be the key to promoting deep cooperation in the field of space. 

&amp;nbsp;

To establish this alliance, a consensus mechanism must be established. The mission of the space chain is to break through the existing internal space barriers of the world aerospace industry by establishing such consensus mechanism and give full play to its existing capabilities to enable the ultimate integration of available resources. **Space chain** aims to reach a consensus on security and common interests.

&amp;nbsp;

For this purpose,**Space Chain** developed **SpaceChainOS**, an operating system designed specifically for spacecraft design. It uses blockchain technology to encrypt the transmitted information to ensure the absolute security of information transmission; the use of blockchain technology in the operating system, sandbox management, so that each satellite running on the App can run safely, and App Its own operational errors or problems will not affect the normal operation of other App, it will not affect the operation of the operating system and the underlying hardware security, to prevent similar computer crashes appear, thus helping to break the barriers caused by security issues, the formation of security consensus.

&amp;nbsp;

While achieving its security, **SpaceChainOS** hardware adaptability is enhanced to meet the different needs of different spacecraft and efforts are being made to promote its compatibility with different spacecraft such as satellite systems, communications, navigation and remote sensing, satellite ground systems, space stations, space Spacecraft, space probes and other applications, in order to achieve consensus of interest.

&amp;nbsp;

In addition to international cooperation and cooperation within the country, the aerospace industry should not remain at a level relatively closed to the general public. Aerospace has always been a mysterious image with a high threshold of entry because of its small market, high cost and small number of qualified personnel. However, as we said before, the move towards space is a consensus that requires the reunification of all mankind. It can not be accomplished solely in the aerospace industry. 

&amp;nbsp;

There is a need to explore a model that will allow more people and more Companies in other industries touch space to more effectively promote human space exploration. Today, the 5G era has brought about a thriving development in the satellite communications industry. The aerospace market has been growing. The mission of the **SpaceChain** Foundation is to solve the remaining two problems of high cost and less qualified personnel so that more people can touch To space.


&amp;nbsp;

**Data and research show that the effective way to reduce the cost of satellite applications is to increase the number of applications of a satellite. Just as a mobile phone has changed from a smartphone like Nokia to a smart phone today, the shift is based on a strong and stable operating system**. 

&amp;nbsp;

* **SpaceChainOS** is the operating system that can solve this problem. Developers can develop satellite applications based on the software development environment provided by **SpaceChainOS** and upload the program code to the satellite via terrestrial data transfer stations in a manner that is extremely simple and extremely efficient to develop. 

* **SpaceChainOS** can therefore greatly reduce the cost of space applications. Reducing access barriers in aerospace field and upgrading the average airspace technology are the most important means to solve the problem of lack of space personnel. 

* **SpaceChainOS** reduces the barriers to use and simplifies the use of space. At the same time, the Foundation of **Space-Chain** Trust will popularize the foundation of aerospace technology in higher education and increase the potential talent pool With, guide the public resources into space exploration career.

&amp;nbsp;

On the basis of the consensus mechanism, if the journey of mankind to explore space can be sustained and the cognitive boundary of mankind expanding continuously, we must stimulate the power from a free society. This requires a more open and cooperative commercial space Socio-economic model. Most current space projects cover both the government and the commercial sectors. The funds and policies of the government-led space project will be guaranteed, but at the same time they will be constrained by the government budget and government efficiency and may be hijacked by large interest groups. 

&amp;nbsp;

In contrast, Pure commercial space projects focus on economics, but regrettably, it is very difficult for space projects to make profits in space according to the current actual situation. Therefore, the issue of spontaneous participation in the construction of space projects needs to be solved.

&amp;nbsp;The mission of the **space chain** is to solve the above problems, establish a socio-economic model and explore a strong collaborative and win-win model in the aerospace field that can support the global collaborative and sustainable commercial space program.

&amp;nbsp;

The recent launch of the new commercial space model is the exploration of man-made colonial space by billionaires who invested in mega-rocket and orbit giant constellations. 
**The Foundation** hopes to use the community incentive model to establish the ecological chain, production chain and distribution chain of aerospace wealth, so that every participant and contributor will get a fair return and attract more resources to participate in the aerospace through this socio-economic model Building, participating in the exploration of human space, and extending human's cognitive boundaries indefinitely.

&amp;nbsp;

At the same time, the **Spacechain Foundation** will also launch an open source hardware development board and a development tutorial that runs **SpaceChainOS**, and promote it freely in colleges and universities all over the world to increase the number of space personnel from the source of education. The increase of the number of talents will greatly enhance the vitality of the industry and provide a continuous momentum of development for space exploration.

&amp;nbsp;

**In short, the SpaceChain Foundation aims to accomplish the following three dimensions:**

1. to break down barriers to cooperation and integrate the existing space resources so that space can better serve the earth and serve humankind

1. to lower the industry access threshold And costs, vigorously develop education and involve more people in space exploration. 

1. we should establish a socio-economic model to support a sustainable commercial space program that will never meet the existing knowledge and insist on striking the border so that human beings The cognitive boundaries continue to expand.

&amp;nbsp;

The **SpaceChain Foundation** hopes to take on the responsibility of exploration, exploring itself, looking around, exploring the planet of habitat, and exploring the cosmic space in which we live. **The SpaceChain Foundation** hopes to attract more talents and public resources, pool the power of all mankind and join together in space exploration. We believe that the wisdom of bringing together a large number of talented and talented people in a clear direction can lead to the establishment of such consensus and continue to input solid forces into the ultimate goal of human civilization toward space.

- It doesn't matter if you split up your balance into many addresses or UTXOs, the only thing that matters are small junks of UTXO transactions.

- Once a reward is retrieved via staking it is NOT true that the entire address is blocked to receive further possible staking revenues.

- therefore overlapping staking is possible with small sized tansactions (in 250 - 400 QTUM size, some say 200-400 is OK as well) on one single address in your QT wallet.

&amp;nbsp;

Due to the continuous development of aerospace technology and the ever-increasing complexity of space missions, spacecraft hardware and software systems are becoming more and more complex. The traditional spacecraft software and hardware design methods, especially software design methods and development tools, have gradually failed to meet this requirement and **how It can improve the quality of software to shorten the development cycle and improve the stability, real-time and reliability of the system become an important issue in the software design of spacecraft.**

&amp;nbsp;

In the design and development of spacecraft software, the introduction of embedded real-time operating system (RTOS for short) can support multiple tasks and provide system functions such as task management and scheduling, task-to-task communication and memory management to users through function calls, By focusing on application development, it helps to generalize and modularize spacecraft software, shorten the development cycle of software products, ensure the real-time performance and reliability of program execution, reduce development time and ensure software quality. This has gradually become a development direction of spacecraft software development.

&amp;nbsp;

**The need for spacecraft to use industry-specific embedded real-time operating systems**

&amp;nbsp;

Foreign embedded operating system has been from simple to mature, spacecraft are generally based on the existing mature commercial embedded real-time operating system for spacecraft software design. NASA USA has been using real-time operating systems in spacecraft since the late 1980s and has adopted RTOS (VxWorks) from the earliest ""Mars Landing"" to ""Spirit"", which proved to be a success of. China's embedded operating system started relatively late, the domestic embedded operating system is not yet mature in terms of technology content and compatibility. **The use of embedded real-time operating system in spacecraft software also shows its unique characteristics.**

&amp;nbsp;

**1.1 based on not open source embedded real-time operating system**

Since the 1980s, commercial embedded operating systems began to flourish. At present, commercially mature embedded real-time operating system has been successfully used in many embedded areas including aerospace, such as: VxWors, QNX. Mature commercial operating system to provide good sustainability, high-performance kernel and friendly user development environment, the user can not care about how the coordination within the operating system, multitasking and other specific technical details, just follow the provided API call system services can be. 

Based on this type of operating system design users can take full advantage of mature technology, flexible and convenient development and debugging, greatly accelerate the progress of development, rapid development of spacecraft software. The way the operating system itself and the development environment are proprietary, the prices are generally higher, usually cost hundreds of thousands of yuan to build a usable development environment, for each application generally have to collect royalties, generally not Provide source code, only provide binary code.

Because they are dedicated operating systems, requiring specialized technical personnel to master the development of technology and maintenance, so the software development and maintenance costs are very high, for the defense of the aerospace industry, due to failure to obtain the operating system source code, the user does not understand The underlying kernel's mode of operation, unable to determine its security, potential anomalous tasks in the operating system may lead to the collapse of the system is its fatal weakness. Especially for the aerospace industry related to national security, safety is even more important and can not be controlled by others.

&amp;nbsp;

**1.2 based on open source embedded real-time operating system**

In the mature embedded operating system, the free open source real-time operating system are: uC / OS-II, Nucleus, uClinux, RTEMS. This kind of operating system is open because of the source code has a large number of resources available, users can understand in depth the underlying kernel mode of operation, and according to their special requirements to delete or modify the system software, the software of standardized management and system software The test has a great help.

Users can fully control the kernel, make full use of mature technology, rapid development of spacecraft software, effectively shorten the development cycle, code quality is also guaranteed; the most representative of which is RTEMS. RTEMS makes it ideal for on-board computers due to its open-source advantages and performance commensurate with the best commercial RTOS, and RTEMS now includes support for ERC32 (ESA CPU for aerospace projects) 11 types of CPU included Motrola MC68K series, Cold-Fire, Hitachi SH, intel i386, i960, MIPS, PowerPC, SPARC, AMD, A29K, HP PA-RISC. Commercial operating system because of its versatility, the hardware requirements are relatively harsh, for example: RTEMS is a more complex RTOS, at least 60KB of memory space to make the system up and running. And the spacecraft system processor models vary, **but does not belong to the general-purpose processor, the existing mature operating system does not support,** such as the domestic field of space commonly used 1750ACP, RTEMS do not support. 

Mainstream real-time operating system has a wide range of applications, features more than the whole; and space applications has its own shortcomings, which will cause conflict between generality and individuality, commercial real-time operating system, some functionality for space applications, redundant,** and The functionality required for space applications is not provided. When using the existing operating system has some limitations, then develop their own embedded real-time operating system will be a better solution.**

&amp;nbsp;

**1.3 based on space design of embedded real-time operating system**

&amp;nbsp;


Spacecraft software development has gone through a non-operating system embedded algorithm stage, to the current embedded CPU-based, simple operating system as the core of the embedded system. The embedded real-time operating system designed for aerospace can increase or decrease the related functions as needed, have more flexibility, and have less system overhead and high efficiency. Because the operating system is developed for specialized real-time applications, it has strong applicability and high work efficiency. 

There is almost no redundant code in the kernel and an excellent combination of kernel size and kernel function can be achieved. And the designer understands the kernel mechanism of the operating system, the analysis of the time is very clear to this system's use occasion, this is helpful for the later test and modification, and the maintenance, expansion, upgrade in the future. In the long run, the development and application of embedded real-time operating system has far-reaching significance for the development and design of spacecraft software. 

**To this end, the Spaceflight Foundation has launched SpaceChain OS,an open-source spacecraft operating system , and hopes to promote consensus building in the aerospace industry.**

&amp;nbsp;

**SpaceChain OS** comes from the mature SylixOS. **SylixOS is a mature large-scale real-time operating system.** Since its launch in 2006, it has been widely used in electric power, rail transit, aerospace, aviation, industrial control and military fields. Among them, many nodes have operated continuously for more than 60,000 hours and their** reliability, stability and real-time performance have been widely verified.**

&amp;nbsp;

**SylixOS supports six major hardware platforms,** including ARM, DSP, SPARC, X86, MIPS, RISC-V. **Covering almost all the processor architectures that can be seen** , including the currently more space-powered PowerPC and SPARC and MIPS. Meanwhile, for the aerospace industry, especially the low-rail emerging processors ARM and the extremely promising RISC-V , SylixOS supports four APIs including POSIX 1003.1b, VxWorksV6.8 (90%), GJB7714-2012, Sylix API.

&amp;nbsp;

**SpaceChain uses a mature SylixOS Kernel as the underlying platform, and on this basis, made the following improvements:**

&amp;nbsp;

* increase for aerospace features and functions. Based on SylixOS, the **Space Chain** Foundation provides a wide range of middleware, code packages, library files, hardware abstraction layers, drivers, etc. for aerospace applications. With the addition of these features and modules, **SpaceChain** OS maximizes space requirements and allows rapid deployment to spaceflight devices, eliminating the need to duplicate wheels for every organization.

* blockchain technology. **SpaceChain** OS integrates blockchain technologies such as **QTUM**. **QTUM**-based blockchain applications can run directly on many embedded platforms, such as satellite computers, to bring greater imagination to space applications.

* improve safety. Integrated blockchain, security sandbox, virtualization and other functions.* 

* improve reliability. For each generation of **SpaceChain** OS, the **Spacechain** Foundation validates it in-orbit and provides the community with safe and secure code.

* application market. On the **SpaceChain** OS platform, with the Blockchain Security Sandboxed, any developer can have a secure environment on the spacecraft to develop their applications, as they do on smartphones.

* technical support services. For start-ups, the **Spacechain** Foundation provides capital, technology, resources and personnel support. At the same time, it uses the pass-through system to promote its rapid growth and provide services and products that are more closely aligned with market demands.


&amp;nbsp;

**SpaceChain OS revolutionizes the space application market**

&amp;nbsp;

The development trend of spacecraft software and the characteristics of embedded real-time operating system determine that more and more embedded operating systems will be used in future spacecraft software development. The introduction of RTOS will bring about a technological change in spacecraft software development . **SpaceChain** OS greatly simplifies the development of the difficulty and the flow of space resources such as satellites can make full use of, improve the efficiency of use, but also can effectively reduce the cost of space applications. Like Android, the low-cost, high-efficiency that everyone uses on the same software platform is obvious. Developing the same Android application that runs on billions of Android devices around the world can happen in the same space.

&amp;nbsp;

**2.1 SpaceChain OS real-time operating system to improve system reliability**

&amp;nbsp;

In the control system, out of security considerations, requiring the system can not collapse at least, but also have the ability to self-healing. Not only the hardware design is required to improve system reliability and anti-interference, but also software design to improve the system's anti-interference, as much as possible to reduce security loopholes and unreliable hidden dangers. For a long time, the traditional software design in the face of strong interference, making the running procedures abnormal, error, runaway, and even death cycle, resulting in the collapse of the system. The real-time operating system management system, the system's single-task design to multi-task programming, not a part of the failure caused the entire software failure.

&amp;nbsp;

**2.2 SpaceChain OS real-time operating system to improve development efficiency and shorten the development cycle**

&amp;nbsp;

Using embedded real-time operating system, the spacecraft software platform software and functional software separation, users can concentrate on writing applications to improve development efficiency. And if you use the same RTOS, some common modules or tasks can be integrated and used in different models to improve software reusability.

&amp;nbsp;

**2.3 SpaceChain OS real-time operating system gives full play to the multitasking potential of 32/64-bit CPUs**


&amp;nbsp;

Onboard computer processors are more complex and more powerful, ranging from 8-bit 8031 ​​to 16-bit 1750A, 8086, up to 32-bit ERC32, 80X86 from the previous 8-bit processor to 16-bit, 32 now, and 64 future. The 32-bit CPU is faster than the 8 and 16-bit CPUs and is designed for running multi-user, multi-tasking operating systems. If you still use the previous design method, you can not play the advantages of 32-bit CPU.

&amp;nbsp;


**Spacefloor Foundation will also establish OS open source community , for the majority of developers to provide excellent and convenient OS and application development environment.**

&amp;nbsp;

**SpaceChain** Foundation will continue to upgrade **SpaceChain** OS and carry out in-orbit validation via satellite or other means of delivery. There are already a number of space companies wanting to use **SpaceChain** OS on their spacecraft, such as LEO satellites, GEO satellites, commercial space stations, launch vehicles and their engines.

&amp;nbsp;

The **SpaceChain** Foundation is also developing and launching its own satellite system based on the **SpaceChain** OS, which will serve the community of space chains. In 2018, the space chain will launch satellites to complete in-orbit verification of **SpaceChain** OS and its hardware systems to complete the technical certification. Follow-up will continue to update **SpaceChain** OS iteration and in-orbit verification, to ensure the security and efficiency of **SpaceChain** OS.

&amp;nbsp;

**In short, by independently leading the iteration and in-orbit verification of **SpaceChain** OS and providing the basic application platform for autonomous launch of satellites, the space chain not only provides operating system and hardware standards but also leads and takes the lead in system construction. At the same time, Stimulated by the system's defined revenue model, existing and new research satellite resources can be encouraged to continuously join the space-based intelligent satellite system and ultimately provide humans with a powerful, efficient and intelligent platform for the development and use of space applications. Many provide low-cost ways to engage in space exploration and applications and exponentially accelerate the growth of aerospace and space exploration activities.**

&amp;nbsp;

**SpaceChain OS development progress**

&amp;nbsp;

**SpaceChain** OS began architectural design in November 2017 and started operating system development over the same period. Now that migration to **Qtum**-based blockchain technology has been completed, the basic blockchain sandboxing has been implemented and EVM virtual machines are being developed at the same time. For spacecraft-specific peripherals, **SpaceChain** is also continuing to optimize the hardware abstraction layer of the operating system design: hardware such as satellite-based satellite, GPS, power management and related system services.

&amp;nbsp;


**Space chain to establish the value of human transmission into space consensus**

&amp;nbsp;

The **space chain** is based on the consensus of mankind's space exploration program and looks forward to finding a consensus mechanism in the field of space exploration that can effectively mobilize the forces of all mankind to spontaneously launch space exploration activities.

The **SpaceChain** Foundation hopes to use the community incentive system to establish an aerospace ecological chain, production chain and distribution chain so that every participant and contributor will have a fair return. Through this socio-economic model, more resources will be attracted to space construction , Participate in human space exploration, and infinitely expand human cognitive boundaries.

&amp;nbsp;

In the future, the space chain will work in three dimensions:

&amp;nbsp;

1. we should break barriers to cooperation in the field of empty space, build consensus and integrate resources so that space will better serve the Earth and serve humankind.

1. to lower the threshold and cost of the industry, to develop education, to increase the talent pool and to involve more people in space exploration

1. to establish a socio-economic model and develop a sustainable space program to continuously explore and expand the boundaries of human cognition.

I have so far setup my loopring.io wallet and opened up a QTUM core wallet and also the QTUM mobile wallet on my android phone.

I am aware that in the QTUM core wallet if I put in the token address in for LRQ it will show my funds if I send it to there. That said however I am having huge problems with the QTUM core wallet syncing on my PC. To put it bluntly it will not sync, after 2 hours of trying the sync lags the wallet out and it crashes. For that reason I have moved to the mobile wallet which has been working perfectly and I have moved some of my QTUM there successfully.

So the issue I am having now is that I cannot find anywhere on the mobile wallet app to add the LRQ address for when I receive my air drop of LRQ tokens. I have binded my mobile app address to the loopring wallet but I am worried that when my tokens are sent to the mobile wallet I will be unable to view them or take them out.

Founded in 2017 by Andre Ornish, Luna’s mission is to fix online dating by aligning platform and user incentives.

People using popular dating apps like Tinder or OKCupid realize very fast that these platforms aim to make them spend a lot of time and money there instead of and helping them meet people in real life and make meaningful connections. Fake profiles, dating choice fatigue, user data abuse and incessant ads make these platforms even less fun.

To offer the best in class dating experience for our users, Luna needed a secure, scalable foundation. Therefore, Luna started looking at the most popular smart contract blockchains — Ethereum, Nem, Waves, Lisk — on which to build their dapp. And decided to build on top of QTUM which offers faster and cheaper transactions while being compatible with existing Ethereum contracts and Bitcoin gateways. Qtum’s hybrid nature, in combination with a first-of-its-kind proof-of-stake consensus protocol, allows Qtum applications to be compatible with major blockchain ecosystems while providing native support for mobile devices.

Luna’s QRC-20 utility token named STARS will make the magic happen on the dating platform.""

http://bfc.baofeng.com/notice_pc.html?id=8

Dear Members of Cloud users: 
We are pleased to announce that Storm BFC Cloud has signed a BCN service agreement with Wave Satellite TRON. 
Wavefield TRON is a decentralized, content-based, blockchain-based content protocol that aims to build a worldwide free content entertainment system through blockchain and distributed storage technologies that allow each user to freely publish, store , And possesses data. Through the decentralized form of autonomy, the content distribution, subscription, push, and empowerment of content creators are determined by the issuance, circulation and transaction of digital assets, and a decentralized content entertainment ecosystem is formed. 
After communicating with the TRON team in wave field, we found out that the essence of the wave field TRON is a P2P data engine system with a complete blockchain system and a large-file service for smart contracts. As a large-scale P2P network operator, we know the implementation difficulty and technical challenge of this network. We also know that it is the natural collocation characteristic of the broadcast cloud node with Tron with mass storage. 
After this cooperation is reached, the Storm BFC broadcast cool cloud will be on the TRON main network of the wave field (the wave field TRON test network is expected to go online at the end of the first quarter of 18 years and the official network is expected to go online at the end of the second quarter of 18 years) Provides support including accounting of all nodes and file resource nodes. 
As part of its strategic partnership, the Wave TRON Foundation will also provide partial rewards to users of BFC Coverage Clouds after its main network goes online, which in part will reward users who will be distributed as BFC credits to all BFC co-op clouds.

In 2016, the total output value of the marine fishing market in the Asia-Pacific region is estimated at 340 billion U.S. dollars (about 220 billion yuan) based on the marine output of 170 billion yuan in the Chinese market in 2016. 

If 40% of the fishing fishery products are traded through the online fishery trading platform, The online transaction volume will reach 88 billion yuan per year. Taking the 30 million fishing and fishing professionals in the Asia-Pacific region as an example, the online fishery trading platform can attract more than 6 million registered users.

&amp;nbsp;

What **Ocean Chain** is looking at is this huge market, aimed at solving the problems of clothing, food, housing, transportation, travel, shopping, entertainment and other aspects of marine fisheries practitioners through a credible, stable and highly efficient trading platform and currency.

&amp;nbsp;

**Demand to create a three-dimensional alliance chain and a weakly centralized circulation economy.**

&amp;nbsp;

* Acquisition of business coverage information (weather, real-time location, information on fishing season)*

* Fishery transactions (release of seafood demand information, distribution of seafood pre-sales information,distribution of seafood, etc.)

* Fisheries services

* Maritime communications (maritime satellite communications)

* Pan-entertainment at sea (satellite television programs, live broadcasts, online games)

* Medical insurance (maritime medical services, maritime rescue, life insurance)

* Financial management Loans, etc.)

* Credit (credit card wholesaler, shipowner credit, fishermen credit) 


&amp;nbsp;

**In terms of technical architecture, Ocean Chain is mainly a coalition chain architecture. However, using QTUM as the bottom of the blockchain and using technologies such as smart contracts, cross-link protocols and lightning networks, Platform, the corresponding token, economic system and cross-chain INK cross-link protocol composed of ecological system. What's more, it incorporates Fabric Super ledger in QTUM technology to enable data exchange between the public chain and the affiliate chain.**

&amp;nbsp;

Compared with the lack of credit support by both maritime supply and demand parties in the past, **Ocean Chain** also conducts credit rating on the shipowners, masters, fishermen and various types of entities on the basis of transaction flow data and authorizes the currency quotas. The purpose of doing so is to both guarantee the recovery of funds from the supply side and provide enough temporary financial support to the demand side.

&amp;nbsp;

**OC is the token of Ocean Chain**. Its core role is to solve the legal currency in the transnational and cross-sea payment and exchange issues, to play a variety of application scenarios payment and settlement exchange carrier. Since most of the traditional offshore transactions use cash and money orders, and in particular Southeast Asian fishermen are still using paper drafts, **the Ocean Chain team has partnered with MAYBANK, PUBLIC BANK and BRI in Malaysia to improve the flow of offshore transactions mode.**

&amp;nbsp;

It is reported that the total issuance of OC is 10 billion, generating 7.5 billion for the first time and the remaining 2.5 billion will be decreasing year by year according to the issuance curve.

To further encourage the circulation of the OC, the company will also work with various application service providers to carry out preferential activities. Use OC to buy communication services, entertainment consumption, insurance payments, have the opportunity to get more discounts and OC rewards

However, I think one mistake Ethereum made was to form an alliance prior to appealing to people(the masses*). Now EEA may be observed to be a centralised entity that was formed behind peoples backs. That is not the 'dream' decentralization people were looking for. In the case of Qtum, i hope to see smarter movements especially in their marketing strategy to reach out to people first.Otherwise, i feel that Qtum will be viewed with dissapointment at the end of the day.

Based on their mutual recognition, the Foundation has decided to replace 1% of **Qtum** with a BTN of 2% of the total, and the market capitalization of **BTN** with a birth rate of just over two weeks exceeds $ 2.5 billion. In addition, **Qtum founder and CEO Patrick Dai** will serve as Chief Advisor to the **New Bitcoin (BTN) Foundation**.

The development trend of spacecraft software and the characteristics of embedded real-time operating system determine that more and more embedded operating systems will be used in spacecraft software development. The introduction of RTOS will also bring about a technological change in spacecraft software development .

&amp;nbsp;

**SpaceChain** OS greatly **simplifies the development of the difficulty and process**, spacecraft capabilities can be fully utilized to **improve the efficiency** , but also can effectively **reduce the cost of space applications** . Like Android, the low-cost, high-efficiency that everyone uses on the same software platform is obvious. Developing the same Android application that runs on billions of Android devices around the world can happen in the same space.

&amp;nbsp;

**SpaceChain** OS has a very strong application scenario in different spacecraft in the field of spaceflight. **Today we first introduce the SpaceChain OS first application in aerospace field:SpaceChain OS and intelligent satellite.**

&amp;nbsp;

Satellite is a concept familiar to all of us. Its full name is man-made earth satellites. It is a manned spacecraft that is launched into space by means of launch vehicles, orbits on the earth with specific orbits and performs special missions. At present, the special missions of satellites include military application, scientific exploration and application and their application to the ground mainly include three aspects: communication, navigation and remote sensing.

&amp;nbsp;

Intelligent satellite is a concept that we are not familiar with, what is a smart satellite? Let's give a brief introduction.

&amp;nbsp;

**Development of smart satellite concept**

&amp;nbsp;

As early as the 1990s, the United States Department of Defense put forward the concept of modular open architecture (MOSA), and the concept of intelligent satellite has taken shape.

&amp;nbsp;

MOSA's core idea is: Firstly, the system is decomposed into a series of standardized hardware and software modules by software and hardware decoupling, and then the performance of the entire system is gradually upgraded through continuous upgrading and reorganization of these hardware and software modules. MOSA architecture-based equipment, not only facilitate the introduction of new technologies, upgrades, but also because of the choice of suppliers, but also easy to control and reduce costs. Based on MOSA, the U.S. military has achieved good results by intelligently upgrading and renovating its radio and radar.

&amp;nbsp;

In 2008, ESA experts also proposed the concept of ""Software-Defined Payload"" (SDP), which is essentially the completion of intelligent satellite payloads.

&amp;nbsp;

Software-defined payloads, comprised of on-board hardware and software technology, can reconstruct satellite payloads for many different scenarios in flight, which can well reduce the operational risk of rigidly configured payloads while increasing the reconfiguration of payloads , Renewable capacity. Harris Corporation has developed a space software defined payload architecture called ""AppSTAR"" under NASA's Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) program to develop several space-based software-defined space software definitions Payload products, such as Ka-band software radios, synthetic aperture radar and ADS-B receivers, have achieved great success, opening the curtain on the intelligence of satellites.

&amp;nbsp;

As of today, **smart satellites are believed to have the following typical characteristics:**

&amp;nbsp;

1. **The demand can be defined:** the satellite can be rebuilt according to the needs of the entire system, flexible response to a variety of different space tasks, to meet the communication, navigation, remote sensing, scientific exploration and other scenarios, to provide a variety of functions to complete a variety of task.

1. **The hardware can be reorganized:** The satellite adopts the open system architecture, has a rich interface form, supports all kinds of payload plug and play, according to the mission needs of the payload, computing resources, exchange resources, storage resources restructuring.

1. **The software can be reconfigurable:** satellite has a consistent program execution environment, with rich application software, you can dynamically configure and execute different APP according to task requirements, to accomplish different tasks.

1. **Functional reconfigurable:** By accessing different hardware components, loading different software components, you can quickly refactor the different functions.

&amp;nbsp;

**Intension of smart satellites**

&amp;nbsp;

**At the heart of smart satellites is the software operating system and hardware computing platform:**

&amp;nbsp;

Its operating system needs strong fault tolerance and shields the underlying hardware details to provide a consistent execution environment for the application and supports plug and play and dynamic configuration of various software components and hardware components.

&amp;nbsp;

Its hardware computing platform needs to have a strong computing power and rich interface forms, integrated sensors, actuators, communication units and other types of payload.

&amp;nbsp;

Intelligent satellites are open systems based on the operating system. Standards-compliant software components and hardware components can be smoothly migrated, seamlessly accessed and flexibly reused on the platform, rapidly expanding the capacity of the entire system. By flexibly adding, reducing and changing the hardware and software components of the system, providing a variety of payloads, loading rich application software, and dynamically building a satellite system capable of satisfying various mission requirements, the complex and varied space tasks are completed. 

In short, the smart satellite is running a powerful operating system with ample fault tolerance on a standardized hardware platform. Based on this operating system, various types of APPs can be developed for satellite applications . Just like Android smartphones, The premise of the call, take full advantage of a variety of sensors to enrich the system capabilities, smart satellites in space also do the same thing.

&amp;nbsp;

**SpaceChain OS and smart satellites**

&amp;nbsp;

It can be seen that the core of the smart satellite is the operating system. **SpaceChain** OS is a reliable real-time operating system for spacecraft. Based on blockchain sandbox technology, **SpaceChain** OS builds rich application software and can be reconfigured to complete different functions / tasks on demand. It is shared by mass users, making it easier for more people to access space applications.

&amp;nbsp;

**Space Chain Technology: SpaceChain OS and Intelligent Satellite**

&amp;nbsp;

**Its significance is mainly reflected in the following three aspects:**

&amp;nbsp;

**1. To achieve the continuous evolution of satellite intelligent functions and performance**



Intelligence requires that satellites have autonomous perception, decision-making and operation capabilities and accomplish complex space tasks through data information processing. The satellite uses the **SpaceChain** OS operating system to continuously upgrade and maintain the satellites after they are launched into orbit under the ever-changing space mission and harsh space environment.

Through on-orbit APP, various powerful new algorithms are continuously integrated into satellite systems to enhance the performance of satellites or to repair satellite faults that occur. In addition to being able to accomplish the tasks that have been set, it is also possible to complete some of the emerging space tasks through betting software to achieve continuous evolution of satellite functions.


&amp;nbsp;

**2. Improve the safety and reliability of the satellite**

&amp;nbsp;

Operating system to lift the satellite system software and hardware between the tight coupling between the standard software components and hardware components to make interchangeable, but at the same time integrated blockchain security sandbox technology, the use of virtualization and other software isolation technology, Improved spacecraft safety. 

And through the block chain security sandboxing, any developer can have a secure environment on the spacecraft to develop their applications, and ensure mutual security between applications and the operation of the underlying operating system security, To the maximum extent, the in-orbit security of the satellite is guaranteed. This also creates better conditions for satellite reliability.

&amp;nbsp;

**3. The promotion of blockchain applications**

&amp;nbsp;

**SpaceChain** OS will be ported in the block chain chain technology, based on the corresponding chain technology smart contracts and Dapp can run smoothly on the **SpaceChain** OS. **This means that these Dapps can run on smart satellites**, greatly expanding the range of applications and types of applications via satellite platforms, just as smartphones are tens of times as many as PC-side applications and smart satellites as new Application platform will burst into a more powerful vitality, while the introduction of blockchain applications, will also multiply the satellite application market.

&amp;nbsp;

**At present, we have transplanted Qtum technology into SpaceChain OS. In the future, Dapp on Qtum can be applied on space-chain smart satellites.**

&amp;nbsp;

In short, **SpaceChain** OS with its unique security and compatibility of blockchain applications will surely provide an unprecedented impetus for the development of smart satellites, open up new markets for the satellite application industry, and open the ""star"" world of blockchain.

On the second day of the New Year, starting at 11 am, the group members with a total market capitalization of about 1 trillion yuan, as the traditional world still rejoice in the Great Reign, Technology, valuation, investment and future, the main questions raised in the group were carefully answered and shared. The full text is as follows:

&amp;nbsp;

**Q1: Stellar recently fierce in Silicon Valley, do you think the threat to eth big?**   

**Patrick Dai:** ETH has become an ecosystem where the greatest risk comes from the risks inherent in one's own ecology but less from outside risks unless there is a tenfold increase in Ethereum's advanced ideas and technologies, giving it an opportunity to replace Ethereum , Otherwise it is a big threat to the nature, but not competing with the front of Ethereum, in other areas (outside the ICO) force, there are still a lot of business and investment opportunities.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q2: What do you think about the millions of TPS that eos claims?**   

**Patrick Dai:** Blockchain is not born for the TPS, if we need faster TPS, the existing banking system and Paypal and WeChat payment, is a better choice. In addition to the degree of decentralization and TPS is basically an irreconcilable conflict, many of the replacement of TPS is to sacrifice network to the degree of centralization to obtain, I personally think, simply in pursuit of higher TPS, but it makes no sense , Especially if the network after only a few dozen large nodes (this is not the early stages of the bank?), Then the high TPS, very often not significant. 

&amp;nbsp;

TPS makes sense for specific things, but requires a compromise with the philosophy behind cryptocurrencies. Because traditional IT technology has been studied for distributed systems for decades, all algorithms based on BFT and various variants can achieve very high TPS, but their degree of centralization is relatively high. The average person in the network is Can not get the right of reciprocity If you can not participate in the supervision and verification of the network, in fact, the use of existing financial services are more than enough.

&amp;nbsp;

**Question 3:** **Qtum** Chain initial design of the core of what is the point? **Qtum** how to build their own ecology? **Qtum** globalization is good, even South Koreans like **Qtum**,landing strategies and methods in different states around the world how to look?**  

&amp;nbsp;

**Patrick Dai:** 

**The core of Qtum Blockchain design:**

1. Security, security is the number one priority for cryptocurrency systems, with no foundation for security and sophisticated software as a back-up.

2. **Qtum** chain is basically compatible with bitcoin's UTXO and all BIPs, and is also compatible with EVM and EVM-based ecology.

1. Flexible, the biggest innovation in **Qtum** is based on bitcoin transaction model, which supports the implementation of smart contract, so that Ethereum's virtual machine can run on the bitcoin network. In addition, the current **Qtum** network is already in the POS phase, and around 3000 A full node. POS is more friendly to business applications. Through technical support, development tools, Community Roadshow investment hatching in the constant construction of the ecology of the **Qtum** Blockchain. The more important thing is landing on the local community developers and local project developers to achieve localization, the international team will also be a lot of help. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Question 4: Decentralized trading system, the future direction of development is?**

&amp;nbsp;

**Patrick Dai**: to the center of the trading system of my research is not much to talk about a few specific cases, the earliest to the center of the trading system is based on the colorcoin mastercoin and counterparty transactions colorcoin on the back appeared on NXT and the BTS Decentralized trading systems, followed by the emergence of etherdelta (based on the smart contract trading system), from the experience above, several decentralized trading system experience, similar to the centralized trading system of high-frequency mobile Sex, a great gap. About decentralized trading system in the order matching and order synchronization, this can find some developers in this area, consult.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q5: ipfs really can really decentralized web and app? Not a simple one? What is the point of going to a centralized app?**   

**Patrick Dai**: IPFS specific technology to achieve no in-depth study, but read the design concept, the project itself also mentioned for several years, to the center of the web and app should be serverless service to developers, as long as the interface , Regardless of who behind the service to provide. Is not a simple token, depending on the ecology behind it, bitcoin is essentially just a piece of data in a bitcoin network, and decentralized apps make sense, but at the moment many of Dapp's really just an app + blockchain as a settlement layer . 

However, the future of blockchain and Dapp's future will transcend the existence of cryptocurrency and will become a social infrastructure: trust. Dapp has a lot of good direction: the game (props channels), content (movie music text), Internet of things, ID and so on.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q6: Everyone has been saying that it is necessary to decentralize and intensify the high level of Dapp's certain degree of contradictions. However, we can not just stay at the stage where btc is used as a currency and eth only serves as a currency to be raised. Developing Dapps to address user needs, that is, the need to strike a balance between a purely decentralized utopia and user application world, Dpos is a solution for now, what do you think? How to grasp the degree of the two?**    

**Patrick Dai:** Indeed, many Dapp is a pseudo-concept, but cryptocurrency itself has begun to penetrate into various places as the first successful application based on blockchain technology. My consideration for the future blockchain system is that there is enough decentralization at the bottom and the application layer can be neutralized. We need a trustless bottom plus an application layer that requires trust, on the one hand, a trustless premium (trust cost Lowest) + centralized premium (centralized), Dapp still has a lot to see in the future, such as gaming (virtual assets and channel changes) digital content (movie music) Internet of Things security and management of digital identities Areas of Pratt &amp; Whitney Finance (Insurance-autonomous finance and micro-financial services, etc.).

At present, many Dapp just use the characteristics of a blockchain, that is, the issuance and clearing of tokens. The blockchain has many other features that need to be discovered and discovered.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q7: How do you think about the feasibility and security of cross-link technology? At present, you are optimistic about this project. In addition, how to ensure the trust and reliability of the link in the chain?**

**Patrick Dai**: I personally feel that the current cross-link area is still in its early stages, both in bitcoin and Ethereum network have limited processing power, and the process of continuous evolution, I personally feel that this one cross-chain is not yet mature enough, and from the solution Just need to point out whether cross-link at least at this stage is not just a need.

On the Oracle side, this is a need, especially in the popularization of smart contracts, we need the blockchain can access external systems, in a sense, the current blockchain is an algorithm-driven self-consistent Closed system, the logic is pre-set. Through Oracle we can introduce external data sources to trigger the execution of the contract. There are many directions on how to solve the problem of credible data sources. 

One is a centralized approach, such as providing data sources by auditing companies and government departments. Another way to go to the center is to introduce games and mortgages. Punish fraud and reward honest data sources and establish a preferred positive feedback mechanism. Of course, there are many other solutions, there is a lot of community research, Microsoft also has a cryptolet project.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q8: Ask a funny, 10 times eth, I have been curious about this issue, high-dimensional playing low-dimensional, non-dimensional entanglement. You must have thought about this 10 times the problem or possible direction method, want to hear you talk about the possibility of 10 times the direction of eth?**   

**Patrick Dai**: 10 times ETH advanced concepts and technology iteration, ETH basically invest this thing is done through the ICO done the ultimate, 15 seconds to complete the investment process (DD TS Token release). It takes a few months, compared to the traditional melting of an angel, which is a difference of 15 seconds vs 3 months. So somehow, ETH becomes the largest investment and financing platform in the world. This is also the largest application of Ethereum, but the application of other smart contracts but did not develop. 

&amp;nbsp;

**From the cash point of view there are several directions:** 

1. distributed governance (refer to bitcoin 1M to 2M process and DAO processing);

1. system of self-evolution and evolution;

1. ease of use 10 times the increase;

&amp;nbsp;

**From a technical point of view:**

1. scalability (full node size participation threshold TPS reciprocal rights);

1. privacy and application independence and loose coupling (refer to Parity theft);

1. Better flexibility (more types of virtual machines and a wider range of smart contract languages);

1. network layering and partitioning and data compression;

1. new consensus mechanisms (often requiring years of testing and practice) and more.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q9: On the current blockchain + distributed computing issues, I think in the future if the dapp market can really make it indispensable based on the blockchain program to solve the calculation, storage, node acceleration and other issues. Currently I see several projects on distributed computing are based on the construction of Ethereum, are worrying about the performance, how do you think?** 

**Patrick Dai**: Distributed Computing I did not study much, but its initial project should come from MaidSafe (https://maidsafe.net/), a nearly 10-year project, essentially Proof of Resource, and many others. The type of computation is actually not very suitable for distributed processing, requiring serial processing of data that is essentially not accelerated through distributed computing, and distributed computing may be able to handle similar game rendering and image rendering needs, but I do not know How big is a market? 

In addition, in distributed computing, it is also a problem how to use a common programming language to describe the computing task to be calculated and submit it accurately to the computing node. This one can consult the head of distributed computing projects.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q10: Analysis of the following characteristics and advantages and disadvantages of the underlying chain: BTC / QTUM / ETH / EOS / NEO / ELASTOS?**  


* **BTC:** theological narrative, community consensus, completed from carriage to car transition, belongs to the encrypted currency attributes, but also want to do a good job of cryptographic currency attributes, UTXO and POW and some standard types of transactions, as a guarantee Secure, reliable and secure cryptocurrency system, a point-to-point electronic cash system. But this is instead the most wild imagination of mankind, and what is more imaginative than creating money?

* **ETH:** smart contract and Dapp platform, before the rise of ICO in March 2017, Ethereum did not show any special advantages, smart contract nor any sign of mass landing, an angel of manhood, promoted Ethereum However, smart contracts are still at an early stage and are still far away from large-scale applications. However, smart contracts should be time-tested in addition to cryptocurrency. Techno-Ethereum is essentially a Global account state machine, through the contract, the funds and data of the account to operate, compared to bitcoin more flexibility. But now also faces various technical challenges. 

* **QTUM:** The Bottom BTC-based UTXO Model (Secure and Reliable) A wide variety of virtual machines (X86 developed by Ethereum EVM + Qtum) can be supported through the account abstraction layer and future support for various programming languages ​​(C ++ Rust) to write a smart contract, is essentially a layered design, taking into account security and flexibility. In addition the underlying is already POS, and there are more than 3500 full nodes.

* Both **EOS** and **NEO** are evolving toward high TPS, but at this moment, I personally feel if I'm in the public chain or need to balance TPS and decentralize. If it is for business services is not needed.

* **ELASTOS** is based on the bottom of NXT, to achieve a distributed computing, the recent lack of attention, but NXT as the earliest implementation of a POS, account-based blockchain system, many of the back of the system is very helpful (NEM, etc. ), NXT technically made a lot of contribution to the development of the blockchain industry, but neglected to manage and operate, early token holders are too concentrated.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q11: At present more discussion is the public chain and the basic agreement, the application of technology in the future how to develop, what application scenarios faster landing?** 

**Patrick Dai**: The current blockchain technology is still in its early stages of evolution, standing in the Internet era 20 years ago, when we can hardly imagine today can be called a mobile phone uber, the development of technology to give everyone a more rich diversity The possibility is the future.

From an application perspective, the blockchain industry is indeed in the early stages of its application. Cryptocurrency is relative to the blockchain, similar to Email versus Internet, but the development behind the Internet goes far beyond emailing for information exchange, Then the future development of the blockchain will certainly not stop at cryptocurrencies born for value exchange. 

Cryptocurrency is just the beginning. From a scenario perspective, the biggest feature of blockchain technology is that it guarantees a trustless platform through a variety of technologies, a trust-free platform that reduces the cost of all business transactions. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Q12: First ask yourself a few questions: blockchain where the biggest investment opportunities?**

**Patrick Dai**: Based on the changes and disruptiveness brought by cryptocurrency, its wealth is created faster than the industrial revolution and the information revolution. From an investment point of view, I personally feel that there are several good directions:

1. Encrypted currency (cryptocurrency and token) in the underlying publicchain, which basically became the industry's first token-based blockchain technology with a close combination of blockchain

1. Technologies and specific application scenarios (the industry is in its infancy) 

1. Encryption Asset Services Portal (Wallet Exchange IM) 

1. Breaking Down Scenarios Across Industries (Games, Entertainment, IoT, ID, Healthcare, Supply Chain) 

1. Organizational Change Research, Economics, Think Tanks, Deep Media.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q13: Is cryptocurrency popular at large scale?**   

**Patrick Dai**: the development of technology with jumping, but difficult to retract, with the car, the car will never disappear, although the carriage also continued to exist for hundreds of years. The advent of cryptocurrency is not a coincidence, but is accompanied by the maturity of various internet infrastructures and the enlightenment of Cyber ​​punk movement concept. It belongs to the fusion of technology and thought, not just to technological innovation. 

Personally, I think the cryptocurrency is unlikely to disappear, the widespread adoption of cryptocurrency depends on the applicability of the cryptocurrency system, including what rigid demands are being addressed, and for the moment, the greatest use is to provide people around the world an option: a very fluid Transparent, credible, secure global assets.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q14: How to build a valuation model of blockchain platform?**   

**Patrick Dai**: I have sent an article before. At present, this is a big problem in the industry. We do not have a set of valuation system to realize early warning and assessment of risks. What is the valuation of a project? Before writing something for your reference. http://www.gongxiangcj.com/posts/3895 ""The number of nodes and cryptocurrency valuation model.""

&amp;nbsp;

**Q15: Who is Nakamoto?**  

**Patrick Dai**: From what I learned, Nakamoto was a hardworking man with idealistic feelings. It should be done independently by one person. There are many anonymous tech bucks in IRC channel in 2011 and 2012, on which you can see Nakamoto's figure. In addition to the birth of BTC, there is also some relationship with a Chinese Wei Dai. 

Wei Dai, who wrote Bmoney's paper before, Zhong Zhongcong and Wei Dai also had some emails, and mentioned to Wei Dai that he has implemented Bmoney's part of cryptoCurrency, but in the second part of Bmoney there is actually a tentative idea about the contract. We can refer to Wei Dai's thesis at http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt and **Qtum**'s idea Wei Dai has had some simple email exchanges, but Wei Dai's interest is no longer in the circle of cryptocurrencies.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q16: In all the coins, which one will live the longest?**  

**Patrick Dai**: simply look at cryptocurrencies, BTC completed a historic jump, but also a breakthrough from 0 to 1, followed by many cryptocurrencies are 1 to 1.1 and 1.1 to 1.2 changes, more than one billion US dollars in the amount of encrypted currency thoroughly It is unlikely that it will disappear because of the drive and governance of the community that the community will uphold even if the developer does not maintain it. However, there are indeed many crypto-currencies that will be eliminated and 95% of the projects should be gone after three years.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q17: 18 years blockchain private market analysis, what kind of industry is better?** 

**Patrick Dai**: Currently the industry needs to find other applications in addition to the cryptocurrency killer app, from the technical development point of view, I personally trust the concept of trustless Platform constantly landing and provide the underlying technology research and development and application scenarios.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q18: Which industry has the largest total of all the industries in the blockchain?** 

**Patrick Dai**: Cryptocurrency itself seems to be the biggest at this moment, and others feel that there are many opportunities for the gaming industry and for digital content (video and audio) and for financial services and the Internet of Things.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q19: Want to hear the competition between the public chain and the public relations and cooperation, how to comment on the big brother?**     

**Patrick Dai**: last year's growth in the industry, in essence, we are still eating BTC created by the combination of technology and ideas, creating a human species in the history of a new species premium, BTC has its historic significance. The groundbreaking idea it brought, gradually attracted the public's attention, but from a technical point of view, what BTC can do is limited, but it does solve its positioning.

Technology is not good or bad, mainly to meet the needs. BTC technology to meet its point-to-point electronic cash system positioning and needs. We do not expect to build infinite applications in the BTC above, this is impossible. The public chain is indeed an open experimental field and a community-driven evolutionary community of interests. Its vitality is also very strong. However, at present, the problem is that we really need technological progress to further promote the scene. If only from the perspective of cryptocurrency, BTC LTC DogeCoin for a user, in essence, is the same experience, and the experience of Ethereum is not much different. The difference is, BTC and the US dollar experience is very different. 

I personally feel that the blockchain industry is an ecology. Whether it is serving one of the areas in the blockchain and ultimately building a blockchain together, it is essentially a collaborative evolution that builds a stronger consensus mechanism. Diversity provides the basis for the choice of consensus, and if there is only one technical direction, then the evolution of technology has become slow. In addition this is only a technical factor, but the blockchain system is not only as simple as technology, there is community community of interests behind.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q20: What dimensions are the most important when evaluating the value of a blockchain project? What factors can be rejected one vote?**

The Beginning: The Essential Elements of the Encrypted Currency Valuation Model (I send some thoughts that I wrote before) As the first truly successful decentralized e-cash system, bitcoin became the anchor of value in the industry and By far the most centralized network, Bitcoin is designed as an electronic currency that is secure, secure, and has a very low threshold of participation in the early stages. 

It is early everyone can participate, and become a full node without any threshold, anyone can download bitcoin client, early mining in his computer, so in fact the realization of the low threshold of the financial services system, everyone With the freedom to join and exit, bitcoin clients have been rapidly evolving early, and if the client is a game, the Bitcoin client's distribution is a borderless game.

In P2P network, a very important core element is full node. In a P2P network, the total number of nodes basically determines the technical value of this network.

&amp;nbsp;

**Why do you say that?**

In the traditional database domain and distributed system, we study the consistency of the data, there are already many, all major companies have their own solutions, but few companies have tens of thousands of distributed system distributed nodes, So most of the research results are more suitable for some enterprises to solve the solution. For example, the Paxos algorithm proposed by Leslie Lamport in 1990 can achieve highly fault-tolerant requirements based on message passing. The latter algorithm is also widely used in google Chubby lock, and Chubby lock behind is widely used in Google's core design Bigtable, bigtable is to support a lot of Google's core business.

&amp;nbsp;

The realization of Bitcoin network is a fusion of technology and humanity.

In a traditional distributed network, in a large company's network, each node in many cases is due to network reasons, dropping or sending wrong messages, instead of deliberately forging information for the sake of profit.

&amp;nbsp;

The realization of bitcoin is facing a more complicated network environment, not only a more complex network environment, but also a more complicated game of humanity. In the traditional distributed network, no one will consider the introduction of incentives to allow nodes to maintain data consistency, Nakamoto was the first person to do so, and through a resource that can not be monopolized (hash function computing power ) To ensure the effective allocation of accounting rights to avoid single-point ddos ​​attacks on specific accounting nodes.

&amp;nbsp;

Bitcoin network to each distributed node in the network, the consistency of each time slice into a time interval consistency, if you look at the global currency bitcoin network, you will find each time slice and time, different The miners in calculating the different chains, in fact, is a bifurcated network, but in a 10-minute time interval, the probability that the data is modified is a Poisson distribution. The probability of the attacker's success is q, The growth of the block is exponentially declining. When the blockchain has six acknowledgments, the attacker's probability of success tends to be essentially zero.

&amp;nbsp;

If you are the full node in a Bitcoin network, then you have the largest and equal rights to the network, and you no longer have to trust third parties or give up your rights to others. At present, many other cryptocurrencies tend to be centralized. Many consensus mechanisms realize a fast transaction processing speed. In essence, they deprive participants of their equal rights and allow the network to return to a centralized network. But if we really need to hand over our rights in the blockchain network, banks may be a better choice than a lot of centralized blockchain systems.

&amp;nbsp;

At present there are about 13,000 full nodes in the bitcoin network. Due to the characteristics of the p2p network, it is very difficult to accurately count the total number of nodes in the network. These 13000 full nodes bear the accounting of the distribution and transaction of currency, and are also bits The foundation of the currency. Bitcoin is definitely a more distributed clearing network than Alipay, and unlike Alipay, Alipay is just a payment instrument that serves the renminbi system. Bitcoin's global clearing network also has its own currency system --- Bitcoin Compared to a bank, opening a bitcoin ""dot"" actually requires only one computer to run a full node. Therefore, the final service boundary of Bitcoin is borderless, and the service objects of banks and Alipay have boundaries.

&amp;nbsp;

Bitcoin achieved a breakthrough from 0 to 1 and completed the carriage-to-car transition (steam engine). In fact, crypto-currencies appeared behind us. In fact, we made some improvements on the basis of Nakamoto. Indeed, we have not Take the carriage again, essentially all the cryptocurrencies are in the car.

&amp;nbsp;

If we look at bitcoin from a software science perspective rather than a currency perspective, the various cryptocurrencies that appear later are essentially improvements and enhancements based on bitcoin's open-source software, which many teams make And upgrading, and not much difference, whether it is to change a mining algorithm, or add some total, a lot of bifurcation is done from 1 to 1.001 experiment, bitcoin from paper currency to electronic currency from 0 To 1 transition and fission.

&amp;nbsp;

Today, Bitcoin has the strongest network effect and the loudest brand effect. Although the technology iteration is very, very slow, some progress has been made one after another, but it can not be surpassed from the aspect of things development. , But no matter whether it will be surpassed, the emergence of bitcoin has its historical inevitability and it will certainly accomplish its historic mission. As the world's largest distributed clearing network and built-in monetary system in the future, as well as the anchor of the value in the parallel financial world in the blockchain and the boost of crazy humanity, we predict where its future highs will be Speaking of other factors aside, cryptocurrency has opened up a new era in which its market value should surpass that of the previous wave of the Internet.

&amp;nbsp;

**Question 21: Blockchain whether the future is required to apply for a license to do?**

**Patrick Da**i: From the future development of cryptocurrency, this is an inevitable.

&amp;nbsp;

**Question 22: The future of blockchain in the IP field?**

**Patrick Dai**: This still need to solve the chain and chain problems, as well as integration with the existing legal system. But purely virtual assets may not be needed, such as audio and video saved in the art and electronic formats of game props and electronic designs. But no matter what kind of industry, we have to think about, in addition to the token premium liquidity brought us by the blockchain, the blockchain really helped solve what problems?

&amp;nbsp;

**Q23: Now the real consumption of blockchain project is not much, why do not wait for the project landing, re-vote? Tencent like buying now is not too late. Estimated seed round billion reasonable?**

**Patrick Dai**: revolutionary ideas and new technology has brought endless imagination mixed with human speculation and greed.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q24: Want to know how to treat EOS Q1 beta?**

 
**Patrick Dai**: the specific progress did not pay attention to too many details, each project has its own position, as long as the solution to a certain area or the general needs, I personally feel that are very valuable. But we also look at the duration of the project is also to our own positioning, if the measurement of time is one day, it is trader, if it is a month, it is a short-term speculators, if it is one year, in the block chain industry is long-term investors If it is three to five years or ten years, it's the value discoverer and the leader in technological change.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q25: What kind of impact can blockchain have on the economic vitality of the third and fourth tier cities today? When will have an impact?**

**Patrick Dai**: I do not know this.

&amp;nbsp;

On February 2, the world's first blockchain payload, launched by the **Space-Chain** Foundation and operating the full node of the **Qtum**, was successfully launched onboard a satellite in Jiuquan. This means that the war in the blockchain industry has spread to the aerospace field. However, does this also foreshadow the **SpaceChain** to enter competitive mode with Elon Musk's SpaceX?

&amp;nbsp;

*""SpaceChain aims to be an open-source blockchain network and we want to use satellite networks to complete the information infrastructure in the blockchain space and in the meantime we have developed our own satellite operating system and hopefully the satellites will become Smarter and each spacecraft can become a blockchain node in space. ""*

*Space Business VP Wuze Qian*

&amp;nbsp;

According to the white paper, the **SpaceChain** is a space exploration program based on human consensus. The vision of the space chain is to find a consensus mechanism in the field of space exploration and face the complex space problem by effectively mobilizing the power of all mankind to meet this challenge.

&amp;nbsp;

**There are three major problems that SpaceChain is trying to solve:**

&amp;nbsp;

1. The international space cooperation is relatively closed; the space cooperation community, which has a consensus mechanism, is urgently needed in the aerospace field;

1. The space industry is currently closed to the public and space exploration lacks support in all fields; 

1. At present the space project has not found a balance between government and commerce.

&amp;nbsp;

Wu Zeqian clarified that the **SpaceChain** itself does not manufacture satellites, but hope that by launching the project, allowing more people to participate together to promote the development of space, 

***""We are actively seeking SPACE X, Airbus and other cooperation, the future will find more world-class commercial space companies to negotiate,""*** through the SpaceChainOS operating system as part of the load on the company's spacecraft, so that Become a blockchain node in space. This also explains the problem we mentioned at the beginning, the space chain is not intended to enter space warfare.

&amp;nbsp;

**SpaceChain in the safety and stability of what has been done?** 

**SpaceChain** based on blockchain sandbox and blockchain information protection technology developed a called **SpaceChainOS** operating system. This is a real-time operating system designed for spacecraft such as satellites based on the SylixOS system.
 
**SylixOS has a history of 12 years and has been developed by Beijing Yihui Technology Co., Ltd.** It is widely used in many industries and fields such as aviation, aerospace and high-speed rail and has a real-time operating system with high security and stability.

&amp;nbsp;

Familiar with the **SpaceChain**, it may be customary to compare with Canadian startup Blockstream blockchain analogy, both common in that they are hoping to bring around the world through satellite networks, real-time blockchain communication services .

&amp;nbsp;

The difference between the two is that **Blockstream is renting high-altitude satellite transmission channels, with weaker scalability**. Space-satellite networks are custom satellite communications payloads, and based on the **SpaceChain** OS operating system, satellites can be continuously optimized and tuned for blockchain communications networks, with each chain and node supporting storage and computation on satellite networks.

&amp;nbsp;

**An image analogy, Blockstream is a functional machine, can only use the 2G network, and SpaceChain is a smart machine, not only can call, you can also install WeChat, Momo and other communication applications, to achieve different scenarios of information and communication. Blockstream is not currently possible,** ***""Blockstream may be more like a purely network operator, and we are hoping to become an ecosystem of blockchain networks.""***

&amp;nbsp;

**According to Wu Zeqian, in addition to QTUM and Beijing Yihui Technology Co., Ltd., space chain has reached cooperation with American commercial space company Nanoracks, US software development team Kubos, Beijing Xihua Science and Technology Co., Ltd. and Goonhilly UK. They all work in their fields for many years.**

&amp;nbsp;

At this stage, **SpaceChain** OS operating system research and development work has been basically completed, expected in March online GitHub open source platform. In the middle of this year, **SpaceChain** will also develop a **SpacechainOS** operating system IDE and development environment that can perfectly fit the hardware. As a result, the threshold for the development of space applications is significantly reduced and the public can participate. 

In the second half of the year, the **SpaceChain** plans to launch the first cubic satellite carrying its own operating system and perform initial on-orbit verification. In addition, according to Wu Zeqian revealed that the first application-grade satellite equipped with **SpaceChain** OS operating system will be launched in 2019.",NA,"7ycpjq",NA,0,NA,"false",1520557048,"false","self","t5_3ilam","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/Qtum/comments/7ycpjq/space_business_vp_wu_zeqian_launch_of_the_first/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

In the past few months, I've been working on a website, called Popcoyn (https://www.popcoyn.com), which is a social network for cryptocurrency enthusiasts.
As a big fan of crypto, I incorporated all things I thought were missing from other websites into this. 


Here are some features of the website:

* I created (and will maintain) a few indexes (or indicators) for the cryptocurrency market. For example,
[CryptoCap100](https://www.popcoyn.com/view-info.php?id=CC100), sum of the market cap of the top 100 cryptocurrencies,
is the crypto equivalent of S&amp;P500 in the stock market. Similarly, [Crypto Essentials Average](https://www.popcoyn.com/view-info.php?id=CEPA)
is the average price of 12 prominent coins, and is the crypto equivalent of Dow Jones.
There's also [Bitcoin Dominance](https://www.popcoyn.com/view-info.php?id=BMD) index. You can check the list of all indexes (along with coins and tokens)
here: https://www.popcoyn.com/coins-and-indexes.php

* On Popcoyn, you can create a portfolio. That is not new. Many other apps offer that. But we allow you to share your portfolio with others, follow other users' portfolio, and see how these portfolios evolve compared to each other in easy-to-read graphs. 

* We know a lot of people don't like to make it known how much they've invested in crypto. To meet this concern, when we show your portfolio to other users,
we scale the amount of the coins in the portfolio so that your portfolio has a total value of $100K.
This way others can see the proportion of different coins in your portfolio, but will not know how much money you actually invested in crypto.

* When you change your portfolio, we keep a record of the older versions so you can compare the performance of different versions over time.

* We have weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual contests to see whose portfolio gains the highest returns. 
https://www.popcoyn.com/contests.php
You will be automatically enrolled in all contests once you make a portfolio. The winners win prizes, which are in Dogecoin. Currently, I'm using my own cryptos to fund the contest prizes but I hope over time donations will help me have bigger prizes for the contests.
You can find users who consistently win contests and explore their portfolios to see what they're doing right.

* Also you receive a little bonus (10 dogecoin) when a new user joins Popcoyn with your referral.

* When looking at a coin page, in addition to usual info, you get portfolio insights: like what percent of users have that particular coin in their portfolio, or what other coins such users have in their portfolio. See this for example:
https://www.popcoyn.com/view-info.php?id=ETH

* You can sort the coins based on a variety of factors such as market cap, volume, change in price, change in volume, circulating/total/max supply.

* The website provides a comfy platform to have conversations about investment strategies, coins, indexes, or contests.


I really hope that you will use and enjoy the website. Let me know what you think.

""JIUQUAN, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) -- China's first shared education satellite, Young Pioneer 1, carried by the Long March-2D rocket, was launched into space from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center Friday afternoon.


The 3-kg CubeSat (100 * 100 * 340mm), Young Pioneer 1, enters an orbit of 502 km above the Earth. The rocket also carried Zhangheng 1, an electromagnetic satellite to study earthquake data, and five other miniaturized satellites.


Young Pioneer 1 was **manufactured and tested by Commsat**, a Beijing-based private satellite company **funded by the Xi'an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics** under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).


It will perform wireless storage and transmission of radio waves at UV frequency, space imaging and the verification of user links to the Internet of Things, said Xie Tao, founder and CEO of Commsat.


After in-orbit tests, Young Pioneer 1 will share its data resources with primary and secondary schools and other education institutions equipped with sub-stations in China.

I have followed the instruction, however when you enter the qtum address in the first step, you put in a newly generated or an old address you've used before, then when you send the designated small amount to the Ubtc address from your wallet, the transaction ID will show that it will come from a newly generated ""Sent from"" address, so they will not be able to tell that you have sent that amount. And the newly generated sent from address will show to have a 0 Qtum balance! So they won't even see that you have any Qtum to work out your Ubtc amount.

When you check their receiving address in the blockchain explorer, you can see a lot of received amounts that come from addresses with 0 Qtum as well, which shows this problem is widespread.

https://qtumexplorer.io/address/QgxaPhaMVG48zo7vCnj3xQnkZKmy6RWsRp

There is no way for them to tell who's sending what. And how much Qtum they have to work out how much Ubtc they have.

I've emailed them highlighting this issue, I'll update this once I've got a reply.

So, has anyone done this process? And am I missing something? Maybe there isn't an issue, seems like there is one though.

The first ever space blockchain node was successfully launched on 2018-02-02. To celebrate this success, SpaceChain together with Qtum Foundation, initiated the “Joy from the Space” smart contract program. This program will conduct lucky draw based on the random number generated.
 
Rules
Duration:
2018/2/14 to 2018/2/18
Participating platforms:
Qbao Community Link: https://qbao.fund
Beechat Community Link: https://beechat.io
Partcipants of the above communities will be deemed to have agreed to the conditions of this event.
 
How to play:

Prizes
Chance of winning: as high as 96%!
About the prize pool:
Grand Prize: if your 5-digit number matches exactly the 5-digit number randomly generated by the space node, your reward will be 0.008 * (total prize token amount / number of grand prize winner)
 
First Prize: if your 5-digit number matches any 4 digits of the 5-digit number randomly generated by the space node, your reward will be 0.135 * (total prize token amount / number of first prize winner)
Second Prize: if your 5-digit number matches any 3 digits of the 5-digit number randomly generated by the space node, your reward will be 0.41 * (total prize token amount / number of second prize winner)

Fourth Prize: if your 5-digit number matches any 1 digit of the 5-digit number randomly generated by the space node, your reward will be 0.094 * (total prize token amount / number of fourth prize winner)
 
 
Lucky Draw Timeline:
1. The timeline of the lucky draw is dependent on the block height of the Qtum network. Each round of lucky draw happens whenever every 1000 blocks are generated. (Usually 1 round is about 30 hours)
2. When the block height ends with 900, the participants in the Beechat/Qbao communities can start to pick their numbers
3. When the block height ends with 866, the current round will not take in any more submission from the participants
4. When the block height ends with 888, random number generatedand the lucky draw starts.
* Note: each participant is only allowed to participate once for each round of lucky draw
 
About redemption of awards
1. Qbao/Beechat will immediately announce the 5-digit number generated by the space node and start the redemption of award after each round.
2. If the participant fails to redeem his/her award before the next round of lucky draw, he/she will be deemed as has forfeited his/her award during the current round. The forfeited tokens will be carried forward to the next round of lucky draw.

Question.1.
 How do you know if a crypto is in token form or coin form.  How do you know if an ICO has already made the swap or not. 

Question 2.
What happens when you send a Coin to a Myetherwallet that holds ERC20 tokens. example: (You buy Qtum from an exchange which you got was a coin because it has already did the swap.  Then you deposit it to your Myetherwallet because you did that before when they were tokens).

Question 3.
For say you bought tokens from an exchange and you send it off to Myetherwallet and hold it for 1 year.  The prices go up and you want to sell it now, except that the token has already turned into a coin.  Only you didn't know because you don't follow that crypto new daily. You then send your Token back to the exchange you bought it at to sell.  What will happen to the Tokens? Will they actually make it to the Exchange and be auto swapped into coins or are they going to disappear?

&amp;nbsp;

Vanywhere is a Skill-sharing platform that revolutionizes the way people seek and offer skills through live, 1-on-1, video, voice and chat, powered by blockchain technology. 
&amp;nbsp;

While this is similar to experty, It is in fact quite different. Vanywhere is more adventurous and playful.
&amp;nbsp;

Working with the concept of ''skilling'' rather than ''expertise'', Vanywhere created a platform which allows any average person with a skill or knowledge in something to get paid. 
&amp;nbsp;

They have a great team, and the CEO has spent the majority of his professional life working in the digital space with international brands such as Clinique, Live Person, Avis, Johnson &amp; Johnson. (a serious all star) 

&amp;nbsp;

The system is explained clearly in their own video. Check it out from 0:46 seconds.

* You'll be able to see how much more dynamic, social and on-the-go this is in comparison to experty.
ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z--kk1pcFcM

&amp;nbsp;

**Product testing**

* Since November 2016, the team has done some extensive testing of the product to fully understand market behaviour and the technical aspects of the platform. During Q1 2017, Vanywhere's iOS platform was live in the iOS Appstore, and downloaded by real users for testing. Vanywhere was found to be particularly well suited to :

   * FASHION AND STYLING. The market is ripe for Skillers interested in fashion who can provide live personalised styling advice 
   * FOOD. Food bloggers and niche gurus who specialize in specific diets such as vegan, gliten-free and paleo, have loyal followers who are eager for personalized attention and coaching in the kitchen
   * Technology help:
Apple Case study. Vanywhere was actually involved in a campaign which recruited people wanting to be paid for offering their advice on Apple tech. Users looking for apple support were connected to apple skillers - and the results were profoundly positive.

* These are just a few, and in reality the possiblities are endless

&amp;nbsp;
***
&amp;nbsp;

This is a classy ico. They already have an app, the token metrics are good. The team is solid and they have a comprehensive market approach and business plan. And i like the idea. I can imagine apple tech heads using this to give advice, foodies offering tips where to eat and fashion gurus being in-store with clothes fanatics helping them shop over iphone facetime.
In comparison to experty, this is less formal and has broader scope. Experty leans toward the professional (M.D's, laywers)

&amp;nbsp;

**Vanywhere (VANY)**

* ICO hard cap: $20m
* ICO price: $0.05 USD
* Current price: 0.000055 ETH
* Circulating supply : 400,000,000 (Total supply is 800m)
Token Sale Date: Announced Soon

I am a QTUM enthusiast and staker on a dedicated node. 
Recently ive been starting to expand my knowledge into the area of AirDrops. 
I understand that i need to use my wallet address to claim these airdrops. However i find something pretty confusing. 
It is to my belief that the project giving AirDrops snapshots the QTUM blockchain from QTUM explorer to see which addresses holds which amounts of tokens. 
But the Address shown in my core wallet never matched the one on QTUM explorer (it is like that my core wallet is ""1 step ahead"" of the explorer). 
At first i could not understand why the address shown on my core wallet had 0 qtum on explorer. I tried checking my accountlist on core wallet and i have only 1 account with all my QTUM. 
I then send all my QTUM to my own address. Now this address has all my QTUM on the Explorer, However i already have a new address when checking in core wallet.. 

Please help my understand which address i need to use to claim AirDrops. ",NA,"7vxx9k",NA,0,NA,"false",1520501366,"false","self","t5_3ilam","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/Qtum/comments/7vxx9k/question_regarding_wallet_address/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

DATx’s blockchain technology combined with artificial intelligence and big data solutions, strives to resolve challenges that are specific to the digital advertising sphere by veering away from a generic one-for-all approach. It can showcase complete user behavioural patterns, including the time they received the advertisement, how long they viewed the advertisement and whether they made the purchase. Leveraging on this transparent, multi-stakeholder record of end-to-end user behaviour data, advertisers can then refine their audience targeting tools, delivering precise advertising only to relevant users.

I was wondering how to create a Qtum wallet offline. 

I found the WebWallet on the [Github](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum-web-wallet) and downlaoded the zip archive and intend to rund the website on an airgaped computer. In the settings, it even mentions offline transaction possibility.

Otherwise, I found the Qtum Electrum Wallet which allows generation of a standard wallet after installation. 

Are both, or either one of the above, legit measures to create offline storage? Purpose is to pile up and access the funds in the future (1 year or later).

And I am Looking for other than Ledger Nano S Solutions.

Rather than type it all out again, here is the information that I pm'd  to @earlz on the QTUM discord:

Hey, I got your invite - but I don't think I'm ever going to get around to submitting this security issue and I'm not after any reward.

Basically what I found was this.  When I installed the QTUM wallet app on my samsung SM-J105Y I was given a lengthy pass phrase  (many words, I'm sure you know what I mean).  This pass phrase can be used to recreate the wallet if, say, my phone is destroyed.
That's all good.  So, before putting any money into the wallet I wanted to see if the pass phrase worked.  So, I uninstalled the app and then reinstalled it again.  Instead of creating a new wallet address, I elected to recreate my old one with the pass phrase.  This worked fine.

The alarming thing, though, was that.  After entering the first word of my pass phrase, my phone auto suggested every other word in the exact same order!!  To me, this means that the intelligent predictive text feature of the keypad has, inadvertently, stored my wallet pass phrase.  How did it get into the keypad log??  I think it must have been when I copied the originally produced version and then pasted it into my note pad.

Of course, I have no idea how long it stays in the keypad log - obviously not for ever as I have restored the wallet a couple of times since and not had the auto suggest predict my pass phrase since.  So, it must get overwritten in time.  Still, I think this needs to be looked into.  If someone else discovered this, it could be bad news for a few people out there.

I will also post this in reddit, just to let the general public know.",NA,"7yk8nq",NA,0,NA,"false",1520561751,"false","self","t5_3ilam","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/Qtum/comments/7yk8nq/security_issue_for_android_wallets/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

What I think I’ve done is entered a character wrong in my password and it takes me though to a address/private key set anyway.  So I’ve probably copied that address and sent to it, so it’s lost basically.

Can anyone help or know what may have happened?

I originally saw the project and passed over when I saw the price as I initially invested end of December in Crypto and although hit some ATH in coins have not been as bad as others that I have read about. Since the corrections I have taken my time in diving deeper into the companies and projects for better understanding. That being said I thought this would be an overpriced investment at the time (ignorant I know as it shouldn't be about price but rather project and abikity). 

Now that these corrections have happened I feel this is prime time for me to take advantage and buy in. I have been taking the time to read up and try to get my best understanding, but have always enjoyed hearing a community perspective. I am debating between Neo and Qtum right now but leaning Qtum for sure. Would like some perspective on this end between the two. I truly believe that the Asian markets will be the next big consumer and business market in the world and am more interested in the devloping companies and projects out of this region despite regulation.

I realize there is a lot of information that I could research and am doing so, but I find that when asking for a discussion there are a lot of perspectives that  get brought up I may not have considered. Like I said I am I am pushing on Qtum, but looking for some more insight and considerations.

I've had a lot of fun developing the explorer when mainnet launched back in September but my full time job has started to take a lot of time and I haven't had time to focus on the site as much as it needs to, particularly as the community and QTUM are growing so much.

It also needs some work, particularly on upcoming QTUM ICOs and  QRC20 tokens so someone who knows Solidity would be great.

I'll allow a few weeks to get some bids in and will make an official announcement in the coming months.

Hi guys,

I've read most of the material on the official website, and like the project, but just can't wrap my head around some things despite my finance background.

Hopefully I can better understand the mechanics of the project and potentially become a QTUM holder.

In a nutshell, I understand that QTUM's goals are twofold i) Maintain a deflationary currency by buying back coins with free cash flows derived from low risk low reward trading ii) Provide liquidity to crypto markets in general through the volume generated by the trading strategies.

My questions
1) Am I missing a goal of the project ? 

2) With 2/3 of the raised capital going into the future development, there should be tremendous advantages on the development side to justify such a large share of the capital.  What are they ?

3) The buybacks occur on a monthly basis, this appears to be a short time frame that will inhibits the liquidity fund to reduce long term supply as it forfeits much of the compounding effect.  Are all profits from the liquidity pool used in buybacks, or is there a part kept in the liquidity fund to increase longer-term growth ?  Is there management fees(not trading fees) taken from the liquidity pools, or is that (indirectly) financed from the development funds ?

4) Is the liquidity fund acting as an explicit collateral for the token ? If not, the value of QTUM is solely derived from its scarcity and not the underlying value. Am I missing something ?

Feel free to answer, or take a stab, at any or all questions. 

Thanks a lot.

The problem statement is as follows.

Elections being conducted via election commissions worldwide are costly, susceptible to corruption. Also, it is impossible to improve the election systems with minor changes due to the huge fixed cost involved in the election infrastructure. The major fixed cost of election infrastructure is spent in order to ensure the secrecy and security of the valuable information which is communicated and carried by any electoral system.

Problem statement:

a person holding an address on the voter chain must first map their voter address to an identity on the identity chain(s). This constitutes of a public address from the voter chain being added to the identity which is uploaded on the identity chain.

1. While the identity on the identity chain is immutable and cannot be destroyed, its voter address can be updated at any time.

2. a voter MAY NOT see which voter address his identity is mapped to, however may change it.(no read only write)

3. this changing must require a biometric authentication such as iris or fingerprint, and may be done any number of times.

4. the initial upload must be done with the supervision of a trusted party to avoid identity duplication and theft.

the identity chain(s) will contain voter specific information, for example locality, constituency, etc

based on the info coming from id chain, the voter upon login will see the available elections, and then choose a candidate in any or each of them, and pay a nominal tx fee(say 0.07$). This vote data is read from the voter chain by every identity chain depending on which identity is mapped to which voter address.

the counting of votes is done from the identity chain itself after having read the votes.

1. the votes recorded on the identity chain MUST be private.

2. The voter address which is read by each identity address MUST be private.","","83gi6x",NA,0,NA,"false",1522284450,"false","self","t5_3ilam","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/Qtum/comments/83gi6x/elections_on_the_blockchain/","","",NA,"","",0,0

On March 27th, Beijing time, the founder and CEO of Qtum was invited to participate in the ""blockchain spring closed-door technology forum"" created by People's Network Ventures and Blockchain Channels and blockchain industry media 31 zones. The experts in the blockchain industry and nearly 500 blockchain enthusiasts discussed the development trend of blockchain technology. 
 
In his speech at the beginning, Patrick Dai said that the entire blockchain industry was accompanied by the effect of wealth to give birth to the current atmosphere, and now should be more to explore the direction of technology. The business model of blockchain is not yet clear. In the future, we need to clarify its development context from the perspective of technology research and development.
 
Many of the blockchain business models cannot be completely predictable. The technology is in an early stage and needs to solve many problems. The first is the technical problem: 

First, the industry is not friendly enough, lacks a new type of smart contract platform, and the POW consensus mechanism is difficult to be deployed on a large scale by the industry. 
Second, poor compatibility, poor compatibility between different blockchain technologies; 
Third, the consensus mechanism is not flexible, the consensus mechanism itself lacks flexibility, and the public chain and alliance chain have different requirements for the consensus mechanism; 
Fourth, compliance and supervision, lack of consideration of industry compliance; 
Fifth, the interaction of the real economy, the lack of blockchain interaction with the real world.

In addition, Dai also said that blockchain technology is still at a very early stage, and that the number of talents for blockchain developers has grown far lower than the growth rate of technology, so this is a development that takes at least 5-10 years. Career. In 2017, the country has included the blockchain in the 13th Five-Year Plan. It is believed that more people will join the industry in the future. The blockchain technology itself will continue to condense the wisdom of developers and eventually achieve positive results.
After the event ended, Patrick Dai also accepted an exclusive interview with blockchain media in District 31, which provides an in-depth analysis of the current status of the industry and future development trends.

The following is an interview with the 31st area:

Reporter: Today is an exclusive interview with the blockchain closed-door forum. What is the most important aspect of this field in your participation?

Patrick Dai: I was still aware of the potential at that time. I think I started to understand this matter in 2012. At that time, there was very little information in Chinese. I went to the altar to learn about the various overseas arguments, and what kind of technology the blockchain was. I learned computer and communication from home and had relatively more knowledge and understanding of the corresponding technologies. After a clear study, I began to think that such a technology was indeed a great innovation. At the time, I also thought that it might happen one day. Today's scene was just as unanticipated as it was. It happened very quickly, far beyond what was expected at that time. At the time, I wrote some articles from 2013 to 2014. At that time, I was the one that attracted me most. I call it an innovative mode without permission. Many innovations have a certain threshold of entry. As long as there are Certain development has a certain ability, you can build a lot of applications. I think this is the point that attracts me most at that time. There is no threshold network. This is very meaningful. From a technical point of view, it was very meaningful at the time. At the time, it did not say that the price of Bitcoin would rise as much as it did, but it was dubious that this matter would be recognized by more and more people in the future. In 2012 and 2013, it was very rare for people to find people in the industry to talk about this matter. Twenty or twenty people in every city in Beijing and Shanghai knew about this, especially in 2012.

Reporter: You can be regarded as one of the earliest people in the industry who are cutting in from a technical point of view. There is a viewpoint that speaks about 80% of the blockchain business + 20% of technology. What do you think about this point of view?

Patrick Dai: Now that the blockchain business is not mature enough, why? The preconditions for technology itself are not yet available. From the perspective of industry development, taking the public chain as an example, the development of the industry needs to overcome more problems inherent in the industry. Many issues I have been thinking about recently, the development of the industry is cyclical, and many sources of cyclical sources do not have much to do with external regulatory policies. More often than not, they are endogenous to the industry. For the whole industry of blockchain, its technology is still incomplete. There are a lot of challenges in this area. The first is how we often talk about how to solve the problem of expansion. This is in itself a big challenge to restrict whether the public chain has the opportunity to become an infrastructure in the future. If a network can only handle one million transactions per day, it is difficult to imagine the future being able to carry the needs of human trust. This is unrealistic. How to solve this problem is definitely a challenge.
In addition, there are many technical details. There are many problems in the industry that need to be overcome and overcome the endogenous problems. We can only talk about what kind of business model we have built. The business model of the future can still be expected because it is, after all, an innovation of concept and technology integration. I believe that in the future it will have a very big impact and impact on our various industries.

Reporter: You just mentioned Qtum in your speech. In the whole design, our idea is to combine the advantages of Bitcoin and Ethereum. How much is the Quantum Blockchain now?

Patrick Dai: Basically, realized the concept of the design at the time, the underlying transaction model was based on the UTXO model of Bitcoin which was very safe, stable and reliable to realize all transaction sending and receiving. By designing the abstraction layer, which is the second-level account abstraction layer, it is compatible with Ethereum's virtual machines. Such a design concept has been recognized by the developer community at home and abroad. As of today, more than 50 projects from seven to eight countries around the world have been built on top of the quantum chain, and the entire developer community is also developing. There may be 200 developers worldwide. In addition, there are currently more than 6,000 network nodes in operation worldwide, and it should be the largest POS blockchain network. Ethereum is about 20,000 full nodes, Bitcoin has more than 10,000 full nodes, and quantum chain is the third largest node in all public chain networks. Therefore, from the perspective of development, such ideas and designs do solve many problems. Compared to Bitcoin, the functions that Bitcoin can achieve can be implemented on quantum links. There is also the flexibility of smart contracts. The compatibility of Qtum and Ethereum is very good. Contracts run on Ethereum can run on quantum links.
In addition, Qtum has obtained many advantages through technology integration. For example, it is very easy to implement a multi-signature custody of a fund on the quantum chain. You can use the Bitcoin signature method to implement the signature. However, the implementation of multiple signatures of funds on the Ethereum network is relatively troublesome, and there are certain doubts about security. Like the Parity purse was hacked before, the biggest reason is that the intelligence of the Ethernet network can be used to sign the funds. The custody and storage of funds is the most essential requirement of a blockchain, and there should be endogenous solutions. This is the advantage of quantum chain gained by merging two systems. In addition, Ethereum has always wanted to switch to a POS network, and the entire quantum chain has been a POS network since its development. To add, Qtum has more and better designs for governance protocols. Judging from the current development situation, it basically conforms to the vision we designed at that time and 100% of the various functions have been realized.

Reporter: According to your observations, what are the most difficult challenges in the blockchain field so far? From regulatory or technical difficulties?

Patrick Dai: There are. At present, there are several challenges in the blockchain industry. One is the challenge of the technology itself, especially how to solve the scalability problems of the network in the public chain system, including the isolation of blockchain resources, the privacy of the blockchain, and the public chain. The governance of the Internet and even the construction of the public chain network ecosystem are all problems that the technology itself needs to solve.
The second issue is supervision and policy guidance. Whether China or overseas, the world is studying the advantages and disadvantages brought about by such a new technology, including what are positive and negative. The blockchain is in the early stage of the industry and the future is full of changes. Many practitioners do not have a clear vision of the future, nor do they know what kind of innovation to do or how to do it. However, one of our ideas at that time was very simple. Talking about too many business models early in the industry did not make much sense, because the maturity of many business models was based on the improvement of corresponding laws and regulations. The biggest opportunity in the early stage of the industry was in the bottom The technology above is ploughed and laid out.
To give a simple example, there are more than 400 core developers of Bitcoin in the world, and none of them are Chinese. Ethereum's core developers have more than 100 people worldwide, and China has one or two people involved. From this perspective, there is a big gap between the entire domestic developer and overseas developers. From the point of view of industry development, the development of public chains is the most difficult, and it is also a matter that can influence the right to speak in the future. In this regard, domestic developers need to refuel, including domestic entrepreneurs, and we really need to have technology in the field. More support, including the ability to make valuable results, can be recognized internationally.
________________________________________

Reporter: Just now we mentioned that the Quantum Chain is now a public chain. There will be cooperation and competition in code open source. Is our side more competitive or more cooperation? How to maintain your own advantages?

Patrick Dai: Because many public-chain projects are community-based, these projects have long-term opportunities for development as long as members of the community support it. It is still too early to talk about competition in the entire blockchain industry , whether Bitcoin or Ethereum. Bitcoin, of course, has some rigid requirements, and projects that include a lot of financing on Ethereum and quantum chains still have questions and need time to verify. However, the early exploration is OK. Which platform is currently solving the application of a large class of requirements is still unknown. Currently, there is no large-scale C-side application based on blockchain technology. Everyone is in a period of exploration. How can we find some suitable direction and use blockchain technology to make valuable applications to C-end users? I think this actually requires joint efforts in the industry. Competition is also a good thing. There are more platforms and choices for developers, and the industry is also a natural fit for the survival of the fittest.
Each platform has different characteristics and may focus on certain features when it comes to developers, including ourselves. For example, our support for the IoT industry and the support for the mobile terminal, including its ability to contribute to the development of Bitcoin's ecology, are quite unique and can be distinguished from many projects. The exploration of the industry needs to find the direction toward the C-end. This is the road that the blockchain will inevitably experience in the future.
________________________________________

Reporter: In your opinion, what are the requirements for the C-side of the blockchain?

Patrick Dai: The development of the entire industry integrates technological innovation and idea innovation. It does indeed contain a large amount of speculative behavior. Only then can the entire industry become such a situation today, and it is not saying whether it is good or bad. This matter has developed to such a stage. At the time, we should go back and review the previous development process. We can really find some valuable directions. We can really use technical features and find some valuable directions.
In the short term, from our perspective, there are several promising directions. One is like the game field. It has some natural similarities with the blockchain, and it has a good combination of points. In addition, digital content, including audio, video, text, graphics, music, movies, and short videos, is easier to complete because it is the content of digital and the value exchange system built by the blockchain for the digital world. seamless connection. Supply chain, Internet of Things, healthcare, health, food safety, these areas are currently facing a very big challenge, how do we build a seamless bridge, the corresponding real-world data can be used as a trusted source of data can be input On the blockchain network, and the logic of network execution can be fed back to the real world. In the middle, we must solve the problem of trust. Whoever is responsible for the problem of these data links is currently being explored. The late period also requires a lot of time. It requires laws, regulations, and supervision. It requires the industry, technology, and government to work together to promote one thing and truly play a role in the blockchain as a high-efficiency, low-cost value network. How to really promote the progress of technology and let it develop in the right direction requires the practitioners of the entire industry to discuss together.
________________________________________

Reporter: Back to the Qtum blockchain itself, the platform also announced some Dapps projects based on quantum chain development. What are the evaluation criteria for these projects on the quantum chain side or what kind of projects are more welcome?

Patrick Dai: Initially, we designed the whole Qtum blockchain toward the public chain with no threshold. The programming of smart contracts is open. We don't have much preference for the above-mentioned projects. Qtum itself is a neutral platform. It is a software system. There is no threshold for developer development. Anybody who wants to develop corresponding applications can do development on it. However, for projects that have some help for ecology, we will have some support. Some developers don't have corresponding development funds in the early stages. They help us find bugs, attract rewards from third-party developers, including rewards. Some training courses are organized to attract more developers to enter this industry.
For very obvious and unreliable projects, we will also try to remind everyone in the community to think carefully and guard against these projects. However, this situation is also difficult to control, mainly because it is difficult to control all project sources, and it is difficult to judge whether the project is doing something seriously. As a platform, we really hope that more entrepreneurs or project parties can really use blockchain technology to solve problems in their industry, so that it can really play its value. The development of the entire blockchain industry is a long-term issue that may take five years, 10 years or even 15 years. It is the biggest opportunity to stick to a stage where the technology is mature, survive and progress.
________________________________________

Reporter: And you have previously published an opinion that 99% of tokens will be zeroed in the next two to three years. What is your judgment based on?

Patrick Dai: The cyclical nature of the development of the industry, the beginning of a lot of projects using the public awareness of the entire blockchain industry differences, through such a concept to raise money or to do some excessive publicity and packaging. The development of the industry has inherent laws. Many such projects will be falsified if they cannot be implemented for a long time. Now investors or people involved are slowly aware of the problems. Any so-called token must resolve some real needs and have the meaning and value of existence. If you simply translate the original point system or the original system, this value is actually not great. There are internal requirements like tokens or tokens in the public chain. For example, a deployment contract must be consumed. It is similar to a license in a sense. There is no threshold for anyone to call the possibility of cyberattacks. There are common tragedies. occur. There is a threshold and a GAS fee. If the value of the upper application token based on blockchain technology cannot find a suitable entry point, only a concept is packaged, and it is gradually realized that many projects will also fail. of. Many new technologies face the survival of the fittest. This is an inevitable thing.
You can also share an experience. In fact, in 2013, there was a protocol named “coins” on the Bitcoin network, and a thousand or two tokens were issued. Now, there are two or three types of tokens. Your token is also good. If you do a project that really solves the problem, you can survive in the long run.
From our team to do technical research and development or to do technical iteration and innovation, including the recognition of some developers at home and abroad, I hope we can survive the cold winter of the industry or the industry's future. We still have great confidence to continue to innovate. As long as we create value, we will attract many developers. Such a project has its own meaning.

Reporter: It is already past one quarter in 2018. What kind of outbreak will happen in the blockchain industry this year, or will it be in the infrastructure construction stage?

Patrick Dai:
There may be some local applications, but for a lot of C-side applications I personally feel it is difficult to appear this year. For example, there are ten million users of C-side users, but also need time. More is the continuous technical iteration. There are more and more new projects entering the industry to solve problems that have not been solved before, such as scalability, privacy, identity, resource isolation, and governance of the blockchain network. There will be more solutions coming out this year. When these technologies mature to a certain degree, there will be more applications on the chain.
As I mentioned earlier, the first areas of explosive applications such as games, digital content, including ID, these areas are more likely to have some natural fit with the characteristics of the blockchain, it is easier to take advantage of the blockchain network.

In fact, this must be the case or else by reorganizing the transactions the minter could get more guesses per second, which would just degenerate into a PoW system. 

This has the side effect of the transactions not being truly confirmed until the next block, which includes the hash of the merkle root of the previous block. This allows a serious exploit, since a minter can easily change the transactions of the previous block without affecting the validity of the hash of the kernel. This allows the minter to effectively change the previous block hash of his kernel, giving him more guesses per second. Again, this just degenerates into PoW. If I am not mistaken, this seems to be a fundamental flaw in the PeerCoin/ BlackCoin/ Qtum PoS model.

&amp;nbsp;

On March 28, 2018,""China Blockchain First Defense"" and Industry Leaders Summit in Beijing, hoping to be able to participate in this blockbuster technical momentum. Among them, those who are eager to try can have courage in their hearts, have wisdom in their brains, can foresee the future, can take care of their feet, and greet this new technology debate with the most correct posture. 

Leading 50+ blockchain industry leaders participated in the conference and delivered speeches, including Sogou CEO Wang Xiaochuan, Founder of NEO, Founder of Onchain Distribution Technology, CEO Da Hongfei, founder of F2Pool, co-founder of COBO wallet Shenyu , Beauty said the founder, HIGO founder Xu Yirong, distributed capital executive director Yu Wenbo, the founder of linear capital Wang Huai, founder of the cornerstone of the ArcBlock block Lao Zhao, director of the Center for Fintech and Internet Security, Renmin University of China, Yang Dong Professor Xu Wei, deputy director of the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University, and so on, used real discussions to collide with the latest knowledge. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Qtum Co Founder Patrick Dai gave a speech on the topic of “The past, present, and future of blockchain”**.

&amp;nbsp;

The topic of my speech today is **""The past, present, and future of blockchain.""** It may not be necessary for PPT. Tell me about my feelings. What should I say? In other words, entering this industry from 2012, basically witnessed the development of the entire industry. It was during the time of reading the Ph.D. from the Chinese Academy of Sciences that it was a chance to learn about Bitcoin's ideas and ideas. From then on, it was always right. This thing is fascinating and has been engaged in a lot of work in this industry.

&amp;nbsp;

I think the understanding of the whole blockchain industry is actually not necessary to kill, nor is it necessary to demonize. A technology appears to have its inevitability. The reason for its emergence is accompanied by the maturity of the Internet infrastructure. A concept.

&amp;nbsp;

Since the 1990s, from the Western community has always been from the password punk ideas and movement, and want to promote the birth of a new point-to-point Internet-based payment system, Bitcoin is a very successful experiment in this field.

&amp;nbsp;

**Why did you decide to join the blockchain industry?** I think this is the initial heart and original intention of returning to this industry. Back to the development of the Internet industry, many business models are built on a very low-level basis. Many business models rely on information asymmetry to provide users with convenience and service, and to obtain certain commercial premiums and fees.

&amp;nbsp;

In the process of the development of Internet protocols, I think that Bitcoin-based agreements have always been missing a seesaw link in this protocol layer. Can we find an agreement based on the value-to-point conversion of point-to-point networks built on the Internet? Need to go through any middleman, so that the value of the liquidity and value conversion efficiency has been greatly improved. In the past, the work of the Internet industry solved the problem of efficient differentiation of information, aggregating information, and re-sale of information. Many of the services provided around the concept of information provided some services.

&amp;nbsp;

The information on the Internet is highly replicable, and its value is also discounted. After the information is disclosed, the value of information is lost. However, recognition of value is often driven by the community. Only when it is recognized by the community and the people can an item have value. Bitcoin has created a new thinking paradigm since 2009, that is to say, I can use the underlying technology of cryptography to ensure that the right to use a certain piece of data on the network is unique, and this transfer has been recognized by the entire network.

&amp;nbsp;

Through such a peer-to-peer network, this network can realize a completely information-equivalent network. In essence, from information inequality to information equivalence, at least from the point of view of all transactions, anyone has the right to review, record, and To verify the authenticity of this transaction, I think that in the development of our previous information system, apart from sharing databases in large companies, it may not be possible to provide the public with all the right to know information outside of the synchronization of several data centers.

&amp;nbsp;

Bitcoin has a complete set of open source, transparent, and right to know and participate. There is no threshold, and there is no such a network of information services as the borders. Behind the protection of cryptography, the protection committee has certain values. There are so many stories in this industry that the first people to enter Bitcoin are those who play games to play gold coins. Why are there so many sources, like World of Warcraft gold coins only down value, there is recognition of World of Warcraft, they later found that during the day to play gold coins, at night can also be used to mine the computer cafes, dig out Bitcoin also on the Internet People recognized. In a sense, it is a kind of community-based behavior that drives this value gradually into the mainstream.

&amp;nbsp;

But I think the emergence of Bitcoin came into being. That is to say behind the birth of the whole thing there is a very large historical reason. I think it can be extended to a meaning. With the help of the information highway infrastructure that we built in the past, we have created mega-sized companies such as BAT, Google, and Facebook. They enjoy the services provided by the well-developed infrastructure and thousands of services. Tens of thousands of users. There is no threshold for bitcoin creation, no need for permission from anyone, and no threshold, allowing entrepreneurs and investors to enter the Internet system. The entire hardware has brought about great changes to the Internet industry.

&amp;nbsp;

Going to understand the blockchain essentially goes beyond the existence of the technology category, and has already derived from the concept of technology some changes in the laws, regulations, and supervision of the society, including our thinking about the centralized system and the decentralized system again. Bitcoin, through its unique gesture, showed us the prototype of the initial design of the Internet. We rethought the pros and cons of centralization and decentralization. We have become accustomed to our data before Bitcoin, our assets, and our funds. In the centralized system, Bitcoin opens possibilities in a new way.

&amp;nbsp;

In essence, the Bitcoin network is a very successful experiment. It is also a process of looking back at the entire development of the Internet 100 years later in the history of mankind. When we are on the path of the entire technology evolution, Bitcoin is a wonderful highlight in human history and it is difficult to ignore. . The Bitcoin network evolved from the initial fully-equalized network to the present day. 

The network develops towards a layered path. The network starts from the peer node and gradually improves the efficiency through some centralized nodes. The network itself At first, it was absolutely decentralized. Absolute fairness and reliability became a compromise between efficiency and fairness. I think this is an inevitable way. There are advantages and disadvantages of centering and decentralization, how to balance, and ultimately how to serve users, we need to make a choice between system design.

&amp;nbsp;

The development of the entire blockchain industry to this day, I think it still faces a lot of problems, that is essentially in a very early stage, the entire industry from the real beginning may be announced from January 3, 2009, the bitcoin code, To the development of the block, the first five years were confined to very small circles. At that time, the most impressive reading doctor visited the community every day. 

At the earliest time, Satoshi Nakamoto wrote a post on it and you will find that these developers and programmers hold With the spirit of idealism, how to make software better, followed by a huge wealth effect, so that more people are concerned about the occurrence of such a thing. But the original idea was nothing more than the very simple idea of ​​using cryptocurrency in community rewards to fund new projects. Then with the expansion of economic interests, more people are aware of this matter.

In 2015, industry practitioners should be aware that there is more conflict between cryptocurrencies and the existing legal and regulatory systems, abstracting the concepts and technologies behind cryptocurrencies, and using blockchain as a very centralized technology. Better to educate the society and pass on some ideas. The development of the entire blockchain industry, from my understanding, really started to get more people from the summer of 2015, and with the help of the technology behind the blockchain, how we can promote some changes in the industry. The entire cryptocurrency is a topic that cannot go around.

&amp;nbsp;

In fact, the development of the entire blockchain industry has become an ecological phenomenon. At the peak, the market value of the entire industry was once US$800 billion. As the market declines, there may still be a market value of US$300 billion. How to understand such a thing? I think that people are always irrational about new technologies. They are mingled with innovations in new technologies and innovations in ideas. They are accompanied by a speculative atmosphere. They often allow new technologies to quickly iterate and precipitate valuable things. Throughout the entire process, how do we put the true value into play and eliminate relevant risks? I think this is a relevant industry practitioner, including policy makers, who need to think together.

&amp;nbsp;

The development of the entire Bitcoin software system has in fact proved to be a safe and reliable system in the past nine years. We do not discuss its monetary factors and indeed created a large P2P peer-to-peer network from the perspective of software development. Thousands of transactions can be carried on top of it, and each person can enjoy convenience through access without a threshold. But how to standardize its development is a question that many of our practitioners need to think about.

&amp;nbsp;

In 2014, in fact, something very interesting happened in the industry. At that time, a very good idea was proposed. Because Bitcoin has limited flexibility and limited flexibility cannot carry its applications, I think this is the original intention of the design. Not the same. Ethereum has a good idea. With the help of distributed networks, we can use more flexibility to carry more distributed applications on top of it. With the concept of smart contracts, smart contracts are behind The essence of this I think is the concept of automating our business processes and commercial transactions more efficiently and more efficiently. 

This is a very idealistic concept. Why do you say that? Blockchain network itself is a self-consistent logic, essentially a highly reliable and reliable symbol system, and the symbol depends on the recognition. In Ethereum, it has more logical operations on these symbols and on these data. These logical operations cannot be implemented on the bitcoin network through scripting languages, and must be implemented through more flexible operations. Why EDM? Virtual machines can perform more efficient operations on data and funds, and this operation is verified by the entire network.

&amp;nbsp;

At present, from the development of the past year, accompanied by everyone’s frenzy of new technologies has caused a phenomenon such as ICU fanaticism. Essentially, business returns to the essence. There is no sustainable business model for any one thing. In fact, no matter what kind of financing model Yeah, it's hard to last one thing. Prove the availability of smart contracts from another dimension, that is, to institutionalize the investment process, no threshold for investment processes, and how to use technology's advantages to avoid its risks. I think this is also a problem that we need to discuss together.


&amp;nbsp;

I think the simplest example is how to look at the value of such concepts as smart contracts. I think we can give us a new perspective on how Internet computers can boost our productivity. Let me give you the simplest example. That is to say, smart contracts are essentially every smart contract that is a virtual agent and a virtual agent that can put your money and can put your data in trust with the virtual agent and Virtual agents help you deal with it. 

For example, like the largest chain of real estate agency companies in China, it may have recruited 100,000 young errands, doing repetitive work every day, signing contracts for buying and selling houses and leasing contracts every day. It may be more appropriate to lease contracts. Repetitive work, in fact, with smart contracts may be on several computers, and for a few minutes you can virtualize 100,000 virtual contracts. The functions and effects of these virtual contracts are essentially the same as the functions and effects of the human resources. In a sense, the cost of commercial operations is reduced, and more commercial transactions become more efficient and more computational. The resources, through the logic of the computer, replace our repetitive labor, which is a very valuable part of business.

&amp;nbsp;

I think that means that the development of the entire blockchain industry has developed into today. In fact, we have witnessed the successes and failures of thousands of projects throughout the industry. I feel that this business model is particularly premature in the early days of the industry. In other words, we are currently examining business models that have been validated from the point of view of industry development. We do not discuss the issues of laws and regulations. We only discuss the development of the industry from the perspective of objective facts. The verified business model is the cryptocurrency itself, as an Internet Community-based, recognized as a carrier of a new type of value, I think it has gradually been verified. In a sense, it proves why there are so many Bitcoin. There are tens of millions of users all over the world. There are so many exchanges. Go to trade such a new transaction variety.

&amp;nbsp;

In addition, I think that the first point is that the concept of smart contracts is still at an early stage. How do we find new technologies that can go beyond pure cryptocurrencies and ICOs to go to the ground? I think the industry is facing new technologies. One challenge, one such challenge, I think there are so many things that can be done in the future. I think the first possible breakthrough point is the field of virtualization and digitization, such as various assets in the game. Value assets and props have such a potential to be reconstructed. The entire game is about the future of the economic system.

&amp;nbsp;

The second point is that we have already digitized ourselves. All of our digital content, including music, video, copyright, audio, and text, I think these are essentially digital things that are easier to deal with as the underlying light chain of the blockchain itself. The natural occurrence of the network.

&amp;nbsp;

The second point is that the entire future glorious understanding of ID will be connected through a unified network for all people's IDs, IDs of things, IDs of things, and systems whose networks are not encrypted. With the uniqueness of the whole thing with ID, there is a unique need to generate a long tail, resulting in a paid scenario.

&amp;nbsp;

The copyright of a single picture makes it difficult for authorization and commercial transactions to occur under the existing system. There is a unique ID, similar to our domain name resolution. Recently, IPFS creates a new file transfer network, giving each file a unique identity and identity. This is like the speed and value exchange of our information exchange. Identification. I think in these areas, the future will surely produce a lot of C-side breakthroughs in some areas. But at present, I am not so optimistic. I think the whole industry really needs a certain amount of time to precipitate. It may be one year or two years. 

In three years, we can really find a product that has a large number of active users with more than 10 million C-ends. This still needs all our practitioners to think about it. When we have a C-side product like this, I think The industry of the entire blockchain can really enter the mainstream society. We can't rely on us to talk about it every day. We can see these applications on the mobile and PC applications.

&amp;nbsp;

To sum up, we entered this industry ourselves in 2012. At that time, we once thought that the entire industry might attract people's attention like today. In fact, some of them happened too quickly. Sometimes it was thought that there was a concern in the industry and society. This happened very quickly. This industry festival has undergone rapid changes and iterations. I feel that all entrepreneurs have not forgotten their hearts and can move forward to find out exactly what they are doing or where they are doing business. What kind of problems and needs do they really go back to, This is the most important.

&amp;nbsp;

In addition, for the development of the blockchain industry, I feel that in essence, we have created a network with no threshold and low-cost information exchange in the history of humankind. This makes it difficult to imagine some payment scenarios and it is difficult to imagine the exchange of value. If the threshold is too high and the business model in which the value exchange path is too long to be realized can be born, I think that these business models will have a very big impact in the future. I think that these impacts will actually have a big impact on some of our entire Internet systems, because these unimaginable business models were born with a new look. It was hard to imagine that it would be hard to imagine that one day they could serve. With regard to the business model of the earth’s owners, I think that in the blockchain network, it may be possible to create such business models that were never expected. I think this will take time and will require historical verification. Thank you all.

meaning you can hedge your long exposure to something you're mining/ staking or have a Masternode by using a MARKET contract to short the derivative of the token

Can you please advise what is your current circulating supply? Is there any official online tracker?

I dont want to rely purely on CMC as their stats are often incorrect.

Can you also please confirm if its correct that you have raised 15 mil USD in ICO?

Above info is for a client who is writing article about successful ICO's.

Many thanks,

(Google Translation, original at http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/coiLXPPtYA-jexYknupVhQ)

An interview with Qtum: The current blockchain technology still has these four major problems that have not been resolved.

Original 2018-03-19 Zheng Kejun Inspector of blockchain.

Want to understand the blockchain, just pay attention to this is enough.

**Introduction**

From the beginning of 2018, blockchain became a hot topic through the east wind of the A-share market. However, in the face of the recent continuous limit of the concept of stocks, many followers who are preparing to enter the blockchain market have been in cold water. Why is the blockchain so hot? Is it a new opportunity or a new bubble? What is insider watching? What is the real significance of blockchain technology?
The blockchain inspectors invited several industry insiders to tell stories of their “fighting” in the industry, share their views, and give some advice to latecomers.
Also come to cloud CEO Chen Hao: use blockchain technology to achieve a new generation of operating systems.
Blockchain entrepreneurs dictate: If the coins are not issued, what is the real value of the blockchain?
Early entrants to the blockchain dictated: After I had been “chicken dish”, I had a cold thought about the industry.
After 95 blockchain entrepreneurs dictated: technology is not guilty, blockchain is not really used to send money.
750,000 bitcoins were stolen. How can the tragedy of the “dollar” circle not be repeated?
The distinguished guest of this period is Patrick Dai (Shuai Chu), the co-founder of Qtum, who was selected for the 2017 Forbes China 30 list of under 30 elites.
As early as 2012, when Patrick Dai was reading at the “Shanghai Institute of Microsystems and Information Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences”, he began to understand the technology behind Bitcoin, and he has been learning in overseas technical communities and has also done development projects. In 2015, he wrote many introductory articles on Babbitt, such as ""Building Your Own Blockchains from 0 to 1,"" including Bitcoin and Ethereum.
In September 2017, the backbone network was officially launched. Before the entire project was released, he would work more than 16 hours a day. After the development of the project, he travels in different places every week. In order to build more developers' communities and projects, he also finds more business partners.
This overworked workaholic has more sophisticated thinking about blockchain technology innovation and R&amp;D.

**Four Challenges About Blockchain**

Currently, the discussion on the classification of blockchains 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 is very hot. Patrick Dai believes that the blockchain cannot be classified as such, and there is currently no mature ecology that can be called blockchain. 3.0.
Because the blockchain is a common technical concept, it is ultimately necessary to see what kind of scenario it solves.
He believes that the current blockchain technology is far from perfect, and there are still many problems that need to be solved in order to develop in a better direction.
It now appears that there are four major challenges: ""The first is scalability, the second privacy and independence, and the third is Governance."" The fourth is Compliance. If there is a real blockchain of 3.0, I think it should be possible to make improvements and breakthroughs in these four areas.""
The first challenge is how to solve the network's scalability. Bitcoin and Ethereum deal with a very small number of transactions each day. Bitcoin, for example, can handle 300,000 transactions a day and Ethereum can handle 1 million transactions. If the blockchain is to be the infrastructure of the future, it needs to deal with tens of millions or even billions of transactions. This will be a challenge for the entire industry. If you really have 3.0, you may want to solve the TPS problem.
The second challenge is how to solve privacy (Internet privacy). Every transaction in the existing blockchain network is transparent. In fact, there will be many privacy issues in the future. If Bank A makes a transfer to Bank B on the blockchain network, but certainly does not want Bank C to see it, then how do you protect the privacy of related business transactions?
Another challenge of independence, because blockchain technology hopes to grow thousands of applications in the future, but these applications should be isolated. The deep binding and deep coupling of this application is actually a big challenge. For example, if there is a problem with an application on Ethereum, it may affect other applications defined on the same network. From this perspective, how do we isolate resources, including the protection of independence?
The third challenge, which is equivalent to the entire blockchain network, has a very large open issue: how to design a better governance model. The network itself has become a distributed network, but governance is still a centralized governance structure.
For example, Bitcoin's bifurcation, if it really has blockchain 3.0, to better solve the problem of network governance, who has the power to make a final decision for a distributed network, to update the software, including how not Injury ecosystems instead of diverging with problems.
The fourth challenge for the entire blockchain industry is the issue of compliance and ecological development.
Now all cryptocurrencies and digital currencies have natural anonymity, which will inevitably face many challenges in regulatory compliance. Can we consider that the future digital currency also has some ID (identity) compatibility, that is, binding with current digital identities and compatible. In addition, the development of the entire digital currency industry faces many compliance issues in the future, which needs to be resolved from the perspective of technical design. For example, through intelligent contracts to complete the management of the participants' user IDs, and when doing governance plans and governance agreements, the roles of regulators and regulators are included, so that they can ensure such openness from a technical point of view, and they can be met in the future. Compliance requirements.
The value of the blockchain is long-term.
From the perspective of the development of the entire blockchain technology, it was originally derived from the concept of digital currency.
Before 2015, everyone was talking about cryptocurrencies or Bitcoin, because at the time, there weren’t many other scenarios for the industry other than cryptocurrencies.
After 2015, more and more people are aware that the technology system behind cryptocurrencies can do more things, but at present, in fact, based on the real application scenarios of blockchain technology, there are two users, one is Digital currency, one is ICO.
Patrick Dai said: ""I think from a long-term point of view, the blockchain is essentially just a technology system. The main purpose of this technology system is to create trust and to create trust as a Trust Machine.""
He believes that talking about the blockchain at least two things, one is the cryptocurrency we are talking about, but we often overlook the second very key concept, called the Trustless Platform (trustless platform). From his point of view, the second point is actually a point where the blockchain really exerts social value and economic value. As a Trustless Platform, smart contracts can be executed on it.
For example, the simplest example, the country's largest real estate intermediary chain, in order to operate their own business model may need to recruit 10,000 errands in the country, go to the house every day, sign contracts. From this point of view, however, a smart contract deployed on a blockchain network is a virtual agent or agent, and they can automatically execute these contracts according to some pre-defined conditions. In a sense, a few computers can be used to replace a job that is done by 10,000 people, which reduces costs and improves the efficiency of economic operations.
From this example, it can be seen that the value of blockchain is a long-term issue.
Patrick Dai said: ""The development of the entire blockchain industry is not a matter of one, two or five years. It is a matter of ten years, fifteen or twenty years. For an emerging technology, I think we have more. It should be viewed in an inclusive and prudent manner because the disruptive impact of the future is also difficult to predict.”
Blockchain still wants to focus on technological innovation.
The handsome entrepreneur who initially hopes to enter the industry can consider clearly that the projects he has done have really solved the technical problems of those natures, including what kind of value has been created for traditional industries, and what kind of pain points have been solved cannot be solved originally. And what value is created, this is the most important. Instead of starting a business for a blockchain startup, we hope to solve the problem, focus on the product, and create value. From the perspective of the development of blockchain technology, there is no necessary link between doing blockchain and issuing coins, that is to say, doing blockchains does not necessarily have to go to send coins.
He believes that the entire blockchain industry is at an early stage: ""I think from my personal point of view, including some of the direction our Qtum is doing, we are still focused on technological innovation."" In the early days, when the business model was not clear, some of the projects with deeper technical accumulation were easier to get support. The innovation of the pure business model, in fact, will face many regulatory challenges. Including the sharing economy in the early days, the network is about to face the car or dizzy as early as the face of many regulatory pressures and challenges.
The innovation in the project business model of a blockchain is something that can be done sooner or later, but the accumulation of technology is actually the premise and factor. Now in the early stages, we mainly look at the advanced nature of technology and the reliability of technology. It depends on what kind of problems can be solved to solve some technical challenges and problems faced by the industry, including whether the previous team members have accumulated some technical aspects and experience in related fields.
As an example, Ethereum was a star project at the time. Because Ethereum completed its own ICO in 2014 and completed a public fundraising. At the time, projects like Ethereum made a new technical iteration mainly for developers' communities. At the beginning, many people did not understand it. However, from the perspective of the entire project, it can be found that Ethereum is indeed evolving towards its own technical orientation. At that time, many people did not expect such great potential.
From the perspective of technology development, such as Bitcoin developers, including the core developers of Ethereum, there are very few Chinese participants, and basically none. Bitcoin may have 400 core developers, none of whom are Chinese. Ethereum may also have nearly 100 core developers. The Chinese developers involved should also be the development of the core code of a relatively large two public chains. There is basically no Chinese participation, so in the long run, there will also be some problems.
At the beginning, Patrick Dai believes that from the perspective of technology development, ""I think that domestic research and development should still devote more energy to the research and development of technologies and the research and development of blockchain technologies. Only in the future will there be more opportunities. Continue to promote some technical R&amp;D and technical standards, and then do some technical developer community.""
It can be seen that some investors specialize in team blockchains, and some of them are particularly opposed. It is difficult to have such an absolute disagreement in the previous investment process.
For this phenomenon, Patrick Dai believes that “a new emerging technology such as blockchain may be overestimated in the short term, but it is underestimated in the long term. It is from the perspective of the impact on the society. In terms of our technological innovation and subversion, I think the future influence is very large.” But in the short-term, it is indeed an upsurge of mixed digital currency and ICO, but there is an overestimated trend. However, long-term influence, as the industry's practitioners are still very optimistic about the value born in the future.
About investment, it is to see what kind of attitude it takes to intervene in this industry in the early days. Now that there are many layouts and investments in this area, the risks will be higher. But from the perspective of return on investment, it may be better.
For a new technology, it should be studied because it is not only a matter of China. The development of the entire blockchain is a global topic. Indeed, the early development of the entire industry created a lot of wealth effects, so it also attracted the attention of the public. He hoped that everyone would pay more attention to technology: ""From the point of view of industry development, I personally may be more inclined to the technical school. I hope everyone can focus on solving some of the technical constraints and challenges that are currently facing. I think only after these constraints and challenges have been resolved can I expect to use tens of thousands of daily living applications. But now it takes time to see this.""
The knowledge of the current blockchain in China is very scarce. The speculative atmosphere in the entire market is heavy and there are big differences with foreign countries. The first reason is that the domestic community is more concerned with what the short-term prices are like, but overseas communities are more concerned with technological progress, development, and some scenarios. The second reason is that there are also many media reports in the country before, and more are biased towards reporting the wealth effect brought about by the blockchain network. However, more overseas reports are more objective and neutral and can highlight technological breakthroughs and changes. The third reason is also a relatively normal thing. After all, the development of the entire blockchain network, from the development of cryptocurrency to Bitcoin, Ethereum, including many projects in this area, has really started from overseas. Most of the documents may be English documents. The Chinese domestic development documents are relatively few, and the Chinese developers have very little information. The fourth reason is that there are relatively few low-level developers in this field in China, which also leads to why they feel that they do not have a good way to get started when they want to understand and learn the blockchain, and they don’t have very detailed information to help everyone. Cognitive.
It takes time for domestic blockchain technology to catch up, and the development of one thing needs to be accumulated and precipitated.

1 99% tokens will be zeroed over the next 2-3 years, and now the industry dividends and liquidity premiums that will be enjoyed will disappear, with a survival rate of about 10/5000, about 0.2% 

2 Investors will be educated and Increasingly clever, we will gradually understand the essence of the blockchain and the nature of decentralized networks. 

3 The emergence of cryptocurrencies has its historic inevitability and will certainly accomplish its historic mission. 

4 Digital entities linked to entities have become more and more numerous, Aeronautical Milestones will soon become the computing devices linked to a blockchain network of digital assets

5 That will accelerate the growth of cloud services such as Amazon and Aliyun in the short run and will hinder their growth in the long term 

6 Blockchain will revolutionize the software development industry , Weakened the app store and Google play status, more and more developers will turn to blockchain development, open protocols and a clear profit distribution mechanism that will eventually upset Apple's application software is a human thought and create coding 

7 Smart contracts are the coding of business logic and interest mechanisms, except that their impact is invisible and slow.

8 Over the past 10 years, several super Apps have left people forgetting what the Internet was supposed to be. The blockchain once again awakens the open agreement, this time with a clear profit-sharing mechanism

12 The long-term attraction of blockchain networks to developers is not the value of tokens, but massively untouchable users and cost-free computing and bandwidth resources that will surely attract millions of developers migrating.

I have been staking my QTUM for almost 3 months. Every time I check it says the wallet is unlocked for staking only and the expected reward is in about 7 days. The only time the wallet and PC wasn't online was when I updated wallet(MacOS) and once because of internet problems.
Why haven't I received any reward? 
I understand that it is luck, but I staked from 20.12.17 and received nothing so am a little disappointed.

Given the increase in nodes, here is an update on network weight. My calculation of network weight uses the known balance for large wallets and takes the ratio of the block rewards won by these wallets vs. total blocks. For example, if big wallets totaling 6.0 million won half the block rewards, then the network weight must be 6.0 / 0.5 = 12 million.

For the 7 day period February 28 – March 6, big wallets totaling 5.9 million won 638 out of 4178 blocks or 15.3%. This gives a current network weight of 5.9 / 0.153 = **38.6 million**.

It's the first fully decentralized exchange with zero fees (not counting eth transaction fees). It's also extremely user friendly, and you can fulfill orders directly from a Metamask wallet instead of having to deposit the funds into a smart contract first.

There's also a few other cool features, but I'll let you guys check it out for yourself.

Most of the volume is in: https://dubiex.com/DUBI/ETH

You can trade QTUM here: https://dubiex.com/QTUM/ETH

Code from the exchange can be found here, so you can verify the legitimacy of everything if you are skeptical.

Qtum, on the other hand, is built on solid principles. The core blockchain is UTXO based, which we know to be secure from BTC and LTC. The network has proper incentives to encourage decentralization and we are already at 4000+ nodes with more coming online at any time. Due to proof of stake consensus, we are able to run a node with minimal hardware (like a raspberry pi), which means the Qtum network is energy efficient and sustainable.

UTXO compatibility also means we'll be able to integrate BTC innovations like lightning network.

The account abstraction layer means more VMs will be created for Qtum over time.

We have a great mix of performance, decentralization, holding incentives, growth potential, and security. These are all important properties for a blockchain. I think Qtum is uniquely and smartly positioned and over time, we'll see it grow into a leadership position in the industry.","","82ra3y",NA,0,NA,"false",1522270299,"false","self","t5_3ilam","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/Qtum/comments/82ra3y/what_i_like_about_qtum/","","",NA,"","",0,0

I'm wondering if I could get some support.

I've signed up to UB.com in preparation for the next Air Drop.

During the process of selecting QTUM as my coin for participation in the Air Drop, it then asks me for my wallet address - now one would assume from here I'd go to my QTUM Wallet, hit Receive and the generate a wallet address and paste this in to the field on the UB site. 

The UB site accepts the address I input, and then asks me to validate the address, I select 'Validate by signing' - and follow the instructions which is; 

Open QTUM Wallet, 
File, 
Sign Message,
Enter the QTUM Wallet Address I entered into the UB site,
Generate Signature, 
Paste this into UB Site. 

But whenever I attempt to complete this, the UB site says my Signature is not valid?

Is this something I'm doing wrong? 

Am I entering the correct QTUM Wallet Address? By generating an address, will UB be able to see how many QTUM's I have in my wallet to work out my Air Drop ration?

Thanks in advance.

After opening qtum wallet I see:  0 active connections to qtum network

When added file peers.dat from other PC's qtum wallet, qtum got 8 connections and downloaded the blockchain ok. However, after that the wallet was NOT sending QRC20 transactions (all passwords ok, ~70 qtum present in wallet). After OKing last step of send tokens (unlock wallet) no transaction is created (seen in the log in the app), no error message popup, no record in debug.log.

""One of the greatest strengths of the Qtum (QTUM) blockchain is that it is highly scalable, as compared to Ethereum. That’s because it makes use of a prove-of-stake algorithm in running smart contracts. This scales more efficiently that the proof-of-work protocol that is used by Ethereum. While Ethereum has been trying to shift towards prove-of-stake, it has faced delays. This means that Qtum has an advantage on this front, and will easily dominate smart contracts with its hybrid infrastructure. This gives Qtum a great future in the enterprise applications space, and that’s where its future value will come from.

The new game comes after Mob Arts’ 2013 runaway success, House of Heroes. Thanks to its popularity, the mobile game was the first to be launched on all Tencent platforms despite being developed by a third party. Now, the studio’s own 777.BINGO platform is betting on cryptocurrencies for a new approach to the game industry. CSO Matt Lee stated that BINGO would be a “pioneer in linking the traditional gaming industry with new blockchain technology.” To participate in QTUM Heroes’ soft launch, visit 777.bingo.""

I support the Qtum project and I really like the design of the structure of the Foundation but I still have many open questions and I would be thankful for clarifications. And before I go big on Qtum I would like to understand more how future problems will be handled.

1. **How exactly do you calculate the voting weight?** In the white paper you wrote ""amount of qtums \+ coin age"". But what if I have qtums of different ages in my wallet? You got any function for that or something?
2. **Who elects the final 9 members of the Judgement Committee?** I found the following contradiction: in another reddit post you wrote that the community \(thus all qtum holders\) elect the 9 members but in the White Paper you state that the community elects 50 representatives and that out of these 9 are elected.
3. **Who pays the Judgement Committee?** Is their salary calculated into the budget?
4. **Do you make your financial reports public?** I assume that the community has no say over the allication of recources as with Dash, but do you at least make the financial reports public at the end of each quarter? Or does the Judgement Committee publish the KPI assessment?
5. **When is the voting starting?** Currently in the client I find no option for voting. Somewhere in a roadmap I found that you plan to implement it June 2018. Is that correct?
6. **Does DGP mean that it is on\-chain voting?** So within the client there will be a voting options connected to the pre\-set parameters and once a voting round is finished, the result is automatically applied to the software? **How often do you plan to vote? In case the DGP is on\-chain, you probably have also off\-chain votings, e.g. in case of disputes?**
7. **What do you plan to have as voting issues?** From what I understand until now, as ""on\-chain"" blocksize and gas price\- what else? And as ""off\-chain""?
8. **On what platform are ""off\-chain"" votes going to be coordinated?** On your Qtum Forum? It looks pretty dead currently.
9. **Who exactly do you consider as a governing party?** Any node? You stated in an article that at the beginning you are going to select trusted governing parties? How do you decide at the beginning whom to trust?
10. **Do you plan do implement a delegated mechanism as in Ark, Waves, Lisk?**

Thank you very much! Looking forward to a lively discussion :\)

With the announcement that Bitmain will offer ASIC miners for Ethereum, climbing hash rates are in the news. Briefly, hash rate is the number of hash calculations made per second across an entire cryptocurrency network. For Proof of Work (PoW) networks (we will get to Proof of Stake below) hash rate scales linearly with [carbon footprint]( https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-01625-x) and Proof of Environmental Damage.

Let’s look at some current PoW hash rates:

Bitcoin 25.5 EH/s (quintillion), or **25,500,000,000,000,000,000** hashes per second.

Ethereum 256 TH/s (trillion), or **256,000,000,000,000** hashes per second.

Now let’s look at environmentally-friendly Qtum Proof of Stake (PoS) mining. For Qtum PoS mining, each full node securing the network does **one** SHA256 hash calculation **every 16 seconds**. We can easily calculate the network hash rate for Qtum as approximately

6,900 nodes / 16 seconds = **431** hashes per second!

This uber-low hash rate also explains why Qtum can be successfully mined with minimal computer resources, such as on a Raspberry Pi.

Save the hashes, save the environment,

Jackson

The simple reason is that it boasts a kind of robustness that comes only with a combination of the best two cryptocurrencies in the market. The project cleverly combines a modification in the Bitcoin Core protocol with an equally technically superior model of the Ethereum Virtual Machine. The use of both Bitcoin and Ethereum‘s network strengths makes this China-based platform stand out among the rest.

The platform allows developers to build decentralized applications that are largely compatible with most of the blockchain-based solutions in the market. This is enabled through the platform’s build that caters for modularity and interoperability.

The number of coins in the qtum core and the number of coins in the transaction are different.
I did an internet search to solve it.
So, i found this solution &gt;   https://thebitcoin.pub/t/solved-my-qtum-disappeared-from-my-qtum-core-wallet-on-mac/12790/7 
I did it that way.
However, when I did so, the number of coins kept small or large, and it did not fit.
 
There is no difference in upgrading the program to the latest version.
I don't understand this error.
So send a screen shot after confirming the transaction, the number seen on the Quantum Core, and the address of the Quantum Core Coin.
 
The number of other tokens is okay.
Qtum coin address.

The distinguished guests expressed their opinions on the blockchain industry, mine pool status, and token mechanism. The following is a series of questions answered by Qtum Co Founder Patrick Dai.**

&amp;nbsp;

***Q: Now what people in the industry are most worried about is where the regulatory policy goes? Will the regulatory measures in the blockchain field have a great impact on entrepreneurs?***

&amp;nbsp;

**Patrick Dai:** At the very beginning of the industry, ICO actually started in the community in 2013, but in fact there was not a definite title at that time. It was more of an early programmer's mutual reward and support. Some open source software development. The earliest bitcoin-based bitcoin-based colorcoin protocol was proof of work. At that time, everyone could donate some bitcoins to get his color coins. The rise of the whole thing was when Ethereum did a standard of ERC20, making the distribution of this token extremely easy. In a sense, it promoted the following crazy financing behavior.* 

As a practitioner in this industry, for this kind of thing, it is certainly from an industry internal perspective. I think that for ordinary people, this is definitely a high-risk thing, so we do not recommend that ordinary users participate in these early stages. Project investment and financing. 

Because whether or not it is based on the blockchain industry, all investment in early projects is a high-risk investment behavior, and it is generally the participation of professional institutions and qualified investors. In the United States, it has passed certain laws and regulations to restrict it to some of the frameworks. I have read a bill some time ago. It seems that it is like a fundraising of 75 million U.S. dollars or less. It may be registered and reported by the SEC of the United States. Make fundraising for qualified and certified investors. 

However, I think that China's Supervisory Authority must have his reasons. The social environment in which we live is the necessity and rationality of supervision. The speculative atmosphere in 2017 is particularly strong. The regulatory policy is actually the regulation and restriction of the entire industry. I think it is a very good thing. 

The blockchain industry startup companies also have many other financing channels, including so many VCs, so much money, ICO this form I think it may have opportunities in the future, perhaps with the development of society and this kind of supervision This type of perfection will have the opportunity to gradually regulate itself from overseas. In Japan or in the United States, it may be regulated in other forms. China's supervision depends on our national policy. As a practitioner, it is certain that To circumvent the risks of some laws and regulations in this area. 

&amp;nbsp;

***Q: Can you tell whether a Token is really better than the company system? Is the token incentive model better than the traditional corporate model? What do you think about the EOS's 21 supernodes? Does absolute decentralization really exist?*** 

&amp;nbsp;

**Patrick Dai:** Token and corporate system, this issue is too big, I think I may not answer, but I talk about some of his simple views. 

Token itself is a community-driven behavior. The most successful tokens are Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin and Ethereum were originally released as open source software. Historically, open source parts have not been particularly good. The business model, such as open source software like Unix and many of our programming languages, inventors may have a very high community status, but there is no business model to commercialize their own intelligence and intelligence. Because everything is reproducible. 

In fact, like Ethereum, it is a project that combines the power of the community. Of course, Vitalik itself is also very powerful, very far-sighted, very smart, but without the support of the Ethereum community, without the above tens of thousands of projects, without the support of developers around the world, it can not be developed to this day. 

Bitcoin is also the same reason. After Nakamoto contributed the first version of the code, it disappeared. The development in the following years actually depends on the help of many communities. There are more than 400 global core developers, and hundreds of core developers from Ethereum globally have maintained such an ecosystem. From this perspective, it shows us at least another model that we humans can cooperate and collaborate with, especially in the software field. This model is not found in the original corporatization system. 

Because the corporatization system emphasizes control management, has a good hierarchical structure, and has good instructions for communication and feedback, but the entire community is a flat operation, he is more transparent, more equal, more freedom. This atmosphere may be a direction of change in our future organizational structure. At least bitcoin and Ethereum have set us such a pattern, but for some time this kind of economy based on communityization will certainly continue to develop because it is also a community of interests. Corporateization is also a community of interests. I think these two models may all advance in synchronization. 

Regarding the EOS 21 Super Node thing, I think it's mainly about the positioning of the project. Bitcoin’s initial positioning is actually very simple. It needs to be a peer-to-peer e-cash network, so to achieve this goal, we must make the entire system without single points of failure. To achieve absolute equality, any People become a peer node and you have equal rights to get all the information on the network and verify all transactions. Then anyone can participate and there is no threshold. 

It is a network without thresholds. The positioning of EOS may be more dedicated to building a distributed application platform in the future. Its starting point may be efficiency and fairness. Centralization and decentralization are negligible. . From the EOS concept, it is more in pursuit of efficiency and the pursuit of how high speed can be achieved every second. However, there are CAP theorem constraints in all distributed networks. The degree of efficiency and decentralization is often an irreconcilable contradiction. This involves trade-offs. 

If it is a cryptocurrency that prefers monetary attributes, like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Zcash, these currencies may pursue fairness and justice, including the concept of peer-to-peer networks. If you prefer application-oriented EOS, you may be pursuing efficiency, giving up fairness and justice, and more often through establishing thresholds. This technology of this network is not accessible to anyone. You must vote to become EOS 21 A full node, this is a very high threshold. Just like a bank has 21 branches, it is back to the path of improving efficiency by setting a threshold. I think in the end which path can win, or that they have room for survival at the same time, it takes time to verify. 

&amp;nbsp;

***Q: In the early days, Qtum links were actually looking for developers internationally. So far, there are some examples of projects that you think are more potential. Some examples can be cited.*** 

&amp;nbsp;

**Patrick Dai:** I have been thinking about the problems of this industry recently. The early accompanied by technological innovations, accompanied by changes in this concept, including a lot of fanaticism and speculation, actually gave birth to the current status of this industry. To calm down and think, in fact, we still have to return to the essence, that is, what blockchain he has provided. I think it is essentially a platform that provides a borderless, low-level settlement that everyone can enter. This is to understand it from the nature of finance. 

From the software's point of view, like Bitcoin's more than 10,000 full nodes, like Ethereum, which has more than 20,000 global nodes, it provides a cloud service based on its own protocol formed through a blockchain protocol. This cloud service will change the way software is developed. In the future, developers may not develop apps for Android. He may deploy a few lines of contracts on Ethereum to realize the process that will take a long time to complete the development process. I think this has caused a huge disruption to our entire software industry, because this subversion has occurred in the district. On a blockchain network, all network users can be reached at no cost. 

The other one that comes with it is from web2.0 to 3.0, and you don't have to worry about storage bandwidth and networking. For example, the original development, but also rent their own server, and now the contract is deployed on the above, all the world's computers to help you do the calculations, which greatly reduces the developer's own development costs and learning costs, I think this In the long run, there will be great changes in the entire software industry. 

In fact, the small program that Xu always talked about is essentially a concept. A smart contract is a very, very small program. Some functional programs, and those projects that are promising, are in the field of digital content. Because it's all digital, it's consistent with the spirit of this digital blockchain network, and if these places can be combined with the blockchain network, it will bring us a lot of unexpected things. Some business models. 

For example, the simplest filmmakers may be able to distribute the film directly through the Internet. All channels, including documents, may have new formats. For example, there is a format that merges with payment channels. You realize this real-time payment while watching movies. I think this emerging data flow distribution and payment The integration of the stream will bring about great changes to all of our digital content. This direction takes a long time to accumulate. But I think that the entire blockchain does have a huge impact from the perspective of finance or the software industry. 

&amp;nbsp;

***Q: There are many users who were all like me, and because now is a bear market, everyone may not have a good attitude. Please give us some advice, how to spend a bear market, or we should be in this big market. How to do it?*** 

&amp;nbsp;

**Patrick Dai:** The development of the industry is certainly cyclical. Individuals still have to build a relatively complete knowledge system and critically receive information. Every day, everybody comes in contact with countless information. However, the final judgment of this value must come from its own independent judgment. This is very important. 

I can feel the big difference between domestic and overseas. Because they often travel overseas, they will relatively rationally view the development of the whole thing. It may be that Americans do not have such a large amount of cash reserves to invest in cryptocurrency assets, such as 1% of personal asset allocation. The maximum is 2%, 3%, and probably no more than 10%. So for this it may be easier to look at it from a technical perspective or from a long-term perspective. 

Then I think that from the individual as an ordinary user to participate in this industry, it is best not to exceed 5% of their assets, which is a more reasonable level, and then to see how the industry in the end develop.

Another point is that we must constantly understand some new technologies and new knowledge emerging in this industry, whether it is entrepreneurs or the media, or participants from all walks of life. Because in the early stage of this industry, everyone's opinions are also inconsistent, and it is more necessary to look at the development of this industry with an inclusive attitude. The attitude of being inclusive and prudent in participating in the project means that for ordinary people, there is no need to participate in these high-risk projects. I personally think so. 

However, we very much hope that the media will have more independent research, independent thinking, not being able to report on something, and being able to independently see the good side and the bad side of some industries. The best article I have read was written by a reporter from the New York Times. He mentioned that the blockchain may be a path to the return of the Internet. The article probably has 50,000 words in its entirety. I think that's the best written article in the industry that I have seen. I have never seen such an article in China. 

From this perspective, I think we need to really be able to use the so-called clear source and to educate users. I think there are so many things that need to be done, technical, policy, and business. Then I will discuss it. I think this is a A long way.

But as For a group of people who entered the field earlier in China, I still think that the blockchain industry is still at a very early stage, and the underlying structure still needs a lot of time and energy to gradually improve. I think this is a 5-10 years. The fact that the widespread use of an emerging technology when it is still immature may have unavoidable negative impacts, so focus on developing the blockchain The underlying infrastructure is still the top priority in the industry.""***

 

&amp;nbsp;

***“At present, there are many high-quality blockchain projects in the world, although the issues they want to solve are different, the consensus mechanisms are different, and the focus is not the same, but many open source code can be shared. The development of blockchain should be avoided. Closed doors and repetitive labor. The mutual exchanges between developers and learning can actually greatly improve the development efficiency and shorten the development cycle of blockchain technology,”***

&amp;nbsp;

As Patrick Dai said, the development iterations of blockchain technology require the collaboration of developers from around the world. Both China and the United States have a solid foundation in computer science and ample talent pools. If we can find the correct development direction of blockchain technology and strengthen mutual learning exchange and resource sharing, blockchain technology will accelerate the pace of becoming the mainstream of society.

&amp;nbsp;

^Part ^of ^this ^article ^was ^taken ^from ^Lei ^Feng ^Report: ^https://www.leiphone.com/news/201803/7fyMPRUnWPIcPi73.html?type=preview

Recently, Qtum officially announced that it will collaborate with Yale University project CertiK to jointly develop a new generation of **""certified blockchain ecosystems""** that will fundamentally improve the reliability and security of blockchains and build blockchains. The cornerstone of the new world's security.

&amp;nbsp;

Certik was founded by Professor Shao Zhong, a professor of computer science at Yale University, and his disciple, Gu Ronghui, an assistant professor at the Department of Computer Science at Columbia University. He is committed to providing state-of-the-art security services for existing blockchain applications. Today, security issues have become the bottleneck of the emerging technology of the blockchain seeking breakthroughs and achieving large-scale landings. Starting from this reality pain point, Professor Shao believes that the most basic solution to the blockchain security problem is to verify all the blockchain codes before the upper chain with formal mathematical proofs to test the blockchain ecosystem. And smart contract security.

&amp;nbsp;

**In the future, CertiK will provide full-stack formal verification services for Qtum including:**

* Security reporting and one-stop validation services for Qtum Dapps
* Formal models for Qtum X86 virtual machines
* The code verification of the Qtum Blockchain escorts the safety of the Qtum ecosystem and lays the groundwork for more practical applications.


&amp;nbsp;

Programmable blockchain technology has the potential to surpass Internet technologies, but the potential is often a double-edged sword. Before people can complete various commercial activities in the blockchain, blockchain constructors must first ensure that Safety and stability. It is believed that Certik's technical support will inject new vitality into the ecosystem of Qtum, and Qtum will also go further towards the **“blockchain for the business world”.**

Qtum brings deep analysis""","Each cryptocurrency will adopt some kind of consensus mechanism so that the entire distributed network can maintain synchronization. Bitcoin adopted the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism from the very beginning of its birth to achieve proof of workload through continuous digital cryptographic hash operations. Since the hashing algorithm is unidirectional, even a small change in the input data will make the output hash value completely different. If the calculated hash value satisfies certain conditions (referred to as ""mining difficulty""), participants in the bitcoin network identify the workload proof. Mining difficulty is an ever-changing hash target. When the speed of network-generated blocks becomes faster, the difficulty is automatically increased to maintain the average of the entire network every 10 minutes.

&amp;nbsp;

**Definition**



**For those who are not very familiar with the blockchain, here are some basic definitions to help understand the post:**



* UTXO - Uncosted output

* vin - vin in a transaction is used to pay for the input of UTXO

* vout - In a transaction, vout represents the newly created UTXO after payment. Vouts is all the output of the transaction

* Hashing — Takes arbitrary data as input, outputs a fixed-length message digest, and the operation is unidirectional. There is also a characteristic: even very small input changes will result in completely different output values

* hash - the output of the hash

* Bitcoin script - the computer language that determines how to spend UTXO

* pay-to-pubkeyhash script - The most commonly used script in Bitcoin to pay for digital currency. As a payer, you only need to know the hash value of the public key of the payment object (usually represented by base58 address). The recipient wants to spend the money, only need to provide the signature corresponding to this public key and the public key itself

* pay-to-pubkey script - very similar to pay-to-pubkeyhash, but pays for the public key itself instead of its hashed address, and the recipient would need to provide a cryptographic signature to indicate possession of the public key to spend the money.

* prevout - vout of the previous transaction as a vin in the transaction

* OP_RETURN script - make an output can no longer be spent, generally used to save some information in the blockchain, without affecting the UTXO model

&amp;nbsp;

**PoW and Blockchain Consensus System**

Through 8 years of development of Bitcoin, the security of the PoW mechanism has been confirmed. However, PoW has the following problems:

&amp;nbsp;

1. PoW has wasted a lot of power resources and is not friendly to the environment;

1. PoW is only economically advantageous for big people who have a lot of power (normal users can hardly mine into mines);

1. PoW lacks incentives for users to hold or use coins;

1. PoW has a certain risk of centralization, because miners tend to join large pools, which makes large pools have a greater influence on the network;

&amp;nbsp;

The right to benefit prove mechanism (Proof of Stake, hereinafter referred to as PoS) can solve a lot of problems among this, because it enables any user with tokens in your wallet can have the opportunity to dig mine (of course, will get mining reward). The PoS was originally proposed by Sunny King in Peercoin. It was later refined and adopted in a variety of cryptocurrencies. Among these are PoS Vasin's PoS 2.0, Larry Ren's PoS Velocity, and the recent CASPER proposed by Vlad Zamfir, as well as various other relatively unknown projects.

&amp;nbsp;

The consensus mechanism adopted by Qtum is based on PoS3.0. PoS3.0 is an upgraded version of PoS2.0, also proposed and implemented by Pavel Vasin. This article will focus on this version of the PoS implementation. Qtum made some changes based on PoS3.0, but the core consensus mechanism is basically the same.

&amp;nbsp;

For general community members and even some developers, PoS is not particularly easy to understand because there are currently fewer documents detailing how to ensure network security in networks that use only token ownership to achieve consensus. This article will elaborate on how to generate, verify, and secure the PoS blockchain in PoS3.0. The article may involve some technical knowledge, but I will try to describe it with some of the basic definitions provided in this article. But at least the reader needs to have a basic idea of ​​a UTXO-based blockchain.


&amp;nbsp;

Before introducing PoS, let me briefly introduce PoW's working mechanism, which can help the following understanding of PoS. The PoW mining process can be represented by the following pseudocode:
&amp;nbsp;



    While(blockhash &gt; difficulty) {

    Block.nonce = block.nonce + 1

    Blockhash = sha256(sha256(block))

    }



&amp;nbsp;

The hash operation used here I explained earlier, that is, to use arbitrary length data as input, after a series of operations, get a fixed-length information digest as an output, but only know the information digest but it is impossible to reverse the corresponding input data . The whole process is a lot like the lottery winning mechanism. You can create a “voucher” by hashing the data and compare it with the target hash range to determine if you “win”. If you don't win, you can create a new ""voucher"" again by slightly changing some of the data. The random number nonce in Bitcoin is used to adjust the input data. Once the required hash is found, the block is legitimate and can be broadcast to a distributed network. Once the other miners in the network receive this new block message and pass the verification, they will add the block to the chain and continue to build the block after the new block.

&amp;nbsp;

**PoS protocol structure and rules**



&amp;nbsp;

**Now we begin to introduce PoS. PoS has the following goals :**

1. Cannot fake blocks;

1. ""Large households"" will not receive much disproportionately large rewards;
1. Having strong computing power does not help create blocks;
1. No one or several members of the network can control the entire blockchain;


The basic concept of PoS is very similar to PoW, and it is like a lottery. The only difference is that PoS can't get new ""lotteries"" just by fine-tuning the input data, PoW uses ""block hash"" as lottery ticket, and PoS introduces the concept of ""kernel hash"".

The Kernel hash takes as input multiple unmodifiable data in the current block. So, because the miners can't find a simple way to modify the kernal hash, they can't get legal through a lot of traversal of the possible hash.New block.

&amp;nbsp;

**In order to achieve this goal, PoS added many additional consensus rules.** 

 First, unlike PoW, the PoS's coinbase transaction (that is, the first transaction in the block) has zero output. At the same time, in order to reward Staker, a staking transaction was introduced as the second transaction of the block. The staking transaction has the following features:

1. There are at least 1 legal vin

1. The first vout must be empty script

1. The second vout must not be empty



&amp;nbsp;

**In addition, staking transactions must also obey the following rules :**

1. The second vout must be a pubkey script (note that it is not pubkeyhash) or an OP_RETURN script that cannot be used to save data on the chain;

1. The timestamp in the transaction must be consistent with the block timestamp;

1. The total output value of the staking transaction must be less than or equal to the sum of all input values, PoS block awards, and transaction fees (ie output &lt;= (input + block_reward + tx_fees));

1. The output corresponding to the first vin must pass the confirmation of at least 500 blocks (that is, the currency spent needs at least 500 blocks to confirm);

1. Although the staking transaction can have multiple input vins, only the first vin is used for the consensus mechanism;


&amp;nbsp;

These rules make it easy to identify the staking transaction, thus ensuring that it can provide enough information to verify the block. It should be noted here that the first vout is not the only way to identify the staking transaction, but since the PoS3.0 designer Sunny King started using this method, and proved its reliability in long-term practice, so we have also adopted this method to identify staking transactions.

 

&amp;nbsp;

**Now that we know the definition of the staking transaction and we understand the rules that it must follow, let's introduce the rules of the PoS block :**



* There is only one staking transaction;

* The staking transaction must be the second transaction in the block;

* The coinbase transaction must contain an output with a value of 0 and an empty vout;

* The last 4 bits of the timestamp of the block are set to 0, which means that blocktime can only represent 16s unit time, which is equivalent to increasing the time granularity;

* The block version must be 7;

* The kernal hash of the block must meet the PoS weighted mining difficulty requirement;

* The block hash must use staking to trade the public key signature corresponding to the second vout. The signature data is stored in the block (but not in the official block hash);

* The signature stored in the block must be ""LowS"", which means that it can only be composed of a single data block and is fully compressed (you can't add 0 as a prefix, nor can you include other opcodes);

* Most of the remaining rules that apply to standard PoW still apply (eg, legitimate merkle hash, legitimate transactions, timestamp must be less than the maximum allowable delay time, etc.);



&amp;nbsp;

The most important of these rules for PoS is the ""kernal hash"". The role of the kernel hash is similar to that of the block hash in PoW. That is, if the hash value matches the condition, the block is considered valid. However, kernal hash cannot be obtained by directly modifying part of the current block. Next, I will first introduce the structure and operating mechanism of kernal hash, and then further explain the purpose of this design, and if you change the unforeseen consequences of this design will bring.

 

&amp;nbsp;

**Kernel Hash in PoS**

**The kernal hash consists of the following data in order as input:**



* The ""skate modifier"" of the previous block (explained later);

* the timestamp of the prevout transaction (used for the output of the previous transaction corresponding to the first vin of the staking transaction);

* output number of prevout (that is, which output is used by the staking transaction);

* The current block time, but the last 4 bits of time are set to 0. This is the only value changed during staking;

 

&amp;nbsp;

**The ""skate modifier"" of a block refers to the hash value of the following data:**



* The hash of the prevout transaction in the PoS block, or the block hash of the PoW block;

* Stake modifier of the previous block (stake modifier of the creation block is 0);

There are only two ways to change the current kernel hash (for mining), either change ""prevout"" or change the current block time.



&amp;nbsp;

In general, a wallet will contain multiple UTXOs. The balance of the wallet is actually the sum of all available UTXOs in the current wallet. This is also applicable in PoS wallets and is even more important because arbitrary output may be used for staking. One of these outputs will be the prevout in the staking transaction, which will be used to generate a valid block.



&amp;nbsp;

In addition, there is one more important change in the PoS block mining process (compared to PoW), which is that the difficulty of mining is inversely proportional to the number of coins owned (rather than the number of UTXOs). For example, a wallet with 2 coins is only half the difficulty of mining. If it is not designed this way, users will be encouraged to generate many UTXOs with small micro-regulations, which will cause the block size to become larger and may cause some security problems.



&amp;nbsp;

**The calculation of kernal hash can be expressed in pseudo-code as:**



    While(true){

    Foreach(utxo in wallet){

    blockTime = currentTime - currentTime % 16

    posDifficulty = difficulty * utxo.value

    Hash = hash(previousStakeModifier &lt;&lt; utxo.time &lt;&lt; utxo.hash &lt;&lt; utxo.n &lt;&lt; blockTime)

        If(hash &lt; posDifficulty){

            Done

        }

    }

    Wait 16s -- wait 16 seconds, until the block time can be changed

    }



&amp;nbsp;

**Through the above process, we find that one of the UTXOs can be used to generate a staking transaction**. This staking transaction has 1 vin, the UTXO we found. At the same time this staking transaction has at least two vouts, the first one is empty, which is used to identify the blockchain, the second vout is an OP_RETURN transaction containing only one public key, or contains the pay-to-pub-key script. The role of the latter is relatively pure (payment), and data transactions can have more uses (such as an independent block signature machine) without destroying the original UTXO model.



&amp;nbsp;

**Finally, all transactions in the mempool will be added to the block.** What we need to do next is generate the signature. This signature must use the public key corresponding to the second vout of the staking transaction. The actual transaction data is calculated by block hash. After signing, we can broadcast this block to the network. Other nodes in the network will verify the block. If the block is valid, the node will accept the block and connect it to its own blockchain while broadcasting the new block to other nodes it connects to.



&amp;nbsp;

**Through the above steps, we can get a complete and secure PoS3.0 blockchain.** PoS3.0 is considered to be the best consensus mechanism against malicious attacks in a fully decentralized consensus system. Why is this conclusion? We can understand the history of PoS development.

 

&amp;nbsp;

**The development of PoS**

**PoS has a long history. Here is a brief description:**

 

&amp;nbsp;

**PoS1.0 — Applied in Peercoin** , heavily dependent on coin age (ie, the time elapsed since UTXO was spent), the higher the coin age, the lower the difficulty of mining. This has the side effect that the user will choose to open a wallet for a long period of time (for example, one month or longer), so that the UTXO of the wallet will have a relatively large currency and the user can quickly find a new block. This will lead to double-spend attacks more easily. Peercoin itself is not affected by this, because it uses PoW and PoS mixing mechanisms, and PoW can reduce this negative effect.



&amp;nbsp;

**PoS2.0 — The coin age was removed from the consensus mechanism** and a different stake modifier was used than PoS1.0. The contents of the amendments are relatively numerous, but basically they are all about how to remove the coin age and realize the security consensus mechanism without using the PoW/PoS hybrid mode.



&amp;nbsp;

**PoS3.0 — PoS3.0 can actually be said to be an upgraded version of PoS2.0**. In PoS2.0, the snapshot modifier also contains the block time of the previous block, which was removed in 3.0, mainly to prevent the so-called ""short-range"" attack, that is, it is possible to change the previous area by traversing. Block time to traverse mining. PoS2.0 uses block time and transaction time to determine the age of UTXO, which is slightly different from the previous coinage age. It indicates that a UTXO can be used for the minimum number of confirmations required by staking. The UTXO age in PoS 3.0 becomes simpler, it is determined by the height of the block. This avoids the introduction of a less accurate timestamp in the blockchain and can effectively immunize the ""timewarp"" attack. PoS3.0 also adds OP_RETURN support for staking transactions, making voutYou can include only the public key, not necessarily the full pay-to-pubkey script.

This coin should easily be top 15  or even top 10.

DISCLAIMER: I hold all the coins listed below.

A) Market Cap

With a Supply of 88M, its in the 50M - 105M category with: ETH, NEO, LTC, ETC (top 20). 

And yet from Market Cap performance currently its at USD 1.4B, price is at $16. Whilst ETH $700 ($69B), LTC $135 ($7B), NEO $59 ($3.9B), ETC $17.7 ($1.8B)

So from a Market Cap perspective we have plenty of growth room - maybe not out pacing ETH but not unreasonable to be around $4B and $60.

B) Developments

Compared to some of the projects above QTUM has its Main Net launched in 2017 and already has big projects launched on its platform like MedBlock. 

X86 VM launching on 23 May in Korea, opening the platform to a broader base DAPP environment.

P.O.S - enough said, speed, power efficiency. 

QTUM partners with BaoFeng and will have 50,000 Nodes, which over shadows BTC (10,000) and ETH (20,000) combined!!!  Baofeng is the largest P2P network in the world.

C) Regulations

Theres still some doubt surrounding Etherium and whether the coin is considered a Security and hence needs to be regulated by the SEC. Which may have some implication for QTUM which runs off the ETH smart contract - am  sure we can argue our way out but the market could be spooked if there is negative news against Etherium.

QTUM holding value can be used for staking, its utility is not a currency, so therefore wont be restricted as other Cryptos who is used purely for payments. The fact that it allows for atom swap, allows for flexibility when it comes to trading.

D) Marketing

A very professional marketing team, that was active at major events and also promoting at all the major markets.

It caters for the masses with the public blockchain, whilst launching a QTUM Enterprise in June to cater for customized Business requirements. The demographic of adopters is well catered.

Other than the $100 PnD at the early days, there has not been any sudden PnD flashes with this project. The gains have been steady and support level is in line with BTCs performance. Not many coins can boast that it performs in line with BTC - some even tank harder when BTC falls (i.e. Nano).

Professional looking website and commucations.

EDIT: Some Marketing Hype factors which QTUM doesnt get enough credit in this Crypto community:

1) QTUM is the first (and only to date) blockchain to be launched into space;

2) The first movie distributed via blockchain was launched on the QTUM platform;

3) Partnership with Pundi X is a big plus for QTUM as many point of sale device will be using QTUM, BTC, ETH as currency for payments (although this confusing because QTUM is not designed as a payment crypto). Pundi X should be next best thing since splitting the Atom for the crypto world as it is bringing crypto to the mainstream! First launching in Indonesia a country of 300M people.

So back to my original question. Since QTUM is doing so many right things, with no negative news of late (or at all). Why is this project so under valued and under hyped?","false","8kpz7q",NA,0,NA,"false",1529745745,"false","self","t5_3ilam","false","",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/Qtum/comments/8kpz7q/qtum_most_under_rated_project/","t3_8kpz7q",NA,NA,"","",0,0

The original interview is posted on [**Block Media**]( https://www.blockmedia.co.kr/news/article_view/?idx=1306&amp;gCode=AB100) with this English version via Google Translate and technical idioms by Jackson.

**Introduction**

Qtum is a hybrid technology implementation with **bitcoin security and Ethernet scalability**, which is known as a ""third generation block chain"" cryptography. Qtum is one of the cryptocurrencies with the greatest price increase, and it has attracted a lot of attention even when prices have risen 15 times in six months since it came out in 2016.

Patrick Dai, a representative of Qtum in China, visited Korea recently. Block Media interviewed Qtum representative Patrick Dai by special invitation from Professor Moon Soo Kim, who is a professor of Digital Strategy Planning MBA at the aSSIST (Seoul National University)

Q1. (Professor Moon Soo Kim): Hello, I am Professor Kim Moon Soo, Founder of Becrypto. I am a professor at the aSSIST (Graduate School of Science and Technology, Seoul National University) and a director of the Digital Strategy Planning MBA and the Director of Cryptographic Economics Research. I teach block chaining and AI (artificial intelligence) technology.

Thank you for your interview with Block Media today. Tell us about this year's Qtum Business.

A1 (Patrick Dai): Last year, the cryptographic market was bullish. So this year, Qtum will continue to work on technical problem solving and development. There are three main ways of how to develop Qtum.

First, Qtum's new Virtual Machine will be built in two months from now. So with these updates, it's easier for developers to program using smart contracts.

The second is the Enterprise version of Qtum, which will give you a much faster block-chaining (TPS) and volume of transactions. This can be applied to the financial industry and many other industries.

Third, Qtum will build two Scaling Solutions. This is because Quantum still does not have enough scalability to solve a lot of data.

Q2. (Professor Moon-Soo Kim) What is Qtum's leadership in the block chain industry when compared to Ethereum or IOS?

A2. Qtum is a really young project. It is attracting a lot of attention from around the world. There is a distinction between Qtum and other projects. Qtum is working on projects to ensure long-term value. It is not trying to compete with other projects. As the blockchain industry is in its infancy, many projects are approaching each other with slightly different directions in system configuration. But to this day, it is not easy to tell which projects are right in the long run. For example, different technological approaches are different for example, implementing a smart contract is based on the Proof of Work system. Qtum has been developing the Proof of Stake system by using Bitcoin and Ethereum technology, respectively. In particular, it can help build a block-chain solution while helping to speed up TPS (transaction per transaction).

Q3. (Professor Moon Soo Kim) What is a more detailed description of Qtum's block chain system?

A3. (Patrick Dai) Sometimes we have to give up fairness for high efficiency. In the case of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Qtum, we applied the PoS decentralized system to Layer 1, and made it available to people freely. However, there are other blockchain systems such as BFT and PBFT. They are like setting a high barrier from a decentralized point of view. As an example, Bitcoin has abandoned P2P networks and fairness to meet high speed TPS. Qtum, however, used an approach that allowed P2P networks to be enabled on one network, Layer 1, and Layer 2 on the other, using technologies such as Lightning Networks and state channels. Most importantly, layer 1 is not changing, but layer 2 is. Qtum also offers the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which also provides a new Virtual Layer. Qtum offers Virtual Machines for many kinds of projects, so many people get what they want. In particular, Qtum uses Ethereum's EVM. So there is no big differences in terms of technology. That's my software industry approach. Do not develop new technology from scratch, but develop a platform based on existing useful systems. Because security is an important issue in the blockchain industry. This is why Qtum is different from other projects.

Q4. (Professor Moon-Soo Kim) In order to develop Qtum business beyond technological barriers, it is also important to secure many DAPPs (decentralization applications)?

A4. (Patrick Dai) I think it's important to inform our Qtum platform and technology. That's why we strive to keep up with Qtum's strengths and technologies and reach out to Qtum developers through global meetings and conferences. Before coming to Korea, I spent two days teaching at a university in Singapore. In particular, we want to provide them with guidelines for the development of developers and to communicate the vision of Qtum. I think it's important to make it easier for 3rd party developers to build Qtum-based DAPPs. It is also a way to enable large companies to offer Qtum service solutions.

Q5. (Professor Moon-Soo Kim) What is most important when designing a token economy?

A5. (Patrick Dai) The reason why many companies do not want to jump into the blockchain industry is because they feel uncertain about the future of the token economy. And uncertainty about the direction of government regulation. In the case of other businesses, the law is already in place, so you can predict exactly what will happen. However, there are still many uncertainties in the case of a blockchain business. At the heart of the token economy is to have many participants organize their ecosystems so that they can receive incentives. Eventually, the future of this business depends on regulations. As the business grows, there may be problems such as regulatory failure. Speak to those who are regulating actively, because the kinds of tokens are really diverse, including utility and security tokens. I believe there will be problems, but ultimately, the token economy will contribute to creating a highly efficient economic ecosystem. Later, someone could win the Nobel Prize for research on the development of the token economy.

Q6. (Professor Moon-Soo Kim) What about Qtum's off-chain business?

A6. (Patrick Dai) Many transactions, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Qtum, occur on blockchains. Block chaining is an open source system that is made available to many people. Bitcoin can handle 300,000 transactions per day, Qtum can handle 3 million limited transactions. Because the blockchain system operates as a global computer, all of this volume is bound to be limited. Moving Qtum's development from the on-chain to the off-chain is a solution to this limited transaction volume and scalability problem. Examples of scalability solutions in off-chains include Lightning Networks, state channels, and plasmas. The current blockchain is one network, one layer. Future block chains, however, will be made up of different layers. That will be the way for the block chain later to be recognized as a trusted network. The same goes for Smart City. Off-chain operations will enable even the most detailed dealings, including transactions in many industries, financial transactions, and healthcare, on the block chain.
Q7. (Professor Moon Soo Kim) In the interim, I am optimistic about the future price of bitcoin, what do you think about the future price of the currency?

A7. (Patrick Dai) I have no comment specifically on the price of bitcoin. The price will depend on the market situation of the coin. But in general, I hope people will reconsider the value of the currency. I want to see people saying ""I have a blockchain application on my cell.” Because the cryptographic price problem is close to the financial market, it's another matter.

Q8. (Professor Moon Soo Kim) I understand the point, but market cap = market capitalization is an important issue for CEOs and investors. Now, Qtum's market value is around 2 trillion won. How will you increase market value in the future?

A8. (Patrick Dai) I think it is the same as developing all market values. It focuses on how to value from a long-term perspective. The same goes for the blockchain industry. Long-term industry. So I think it is difficult to predict price fluctuations in the future. I have a teacher in Silicon Valley who has a relationship with me. In the past, he correctly predicted the price of bitcoin, but I think he will make a good prediction again this time.

Q9. (Professor Moon Soo Kim) By the end of June this year, I plan to visit China with my MBA students in Shanghai, China on the topic of passwords. Can I visit at that time?

A9. (Patrick Dai) Yes, it's okay.

Q10. (Professor Moon Soo Kim) Do you have a comment for Block Media?

A10. (Patrick Dai) Thank you for the opportunity for this interview on Block Media. I hope that many people will pay more attention to the technical aspects of the blockchain and cryptography that have this long-term value. Also, if you are interested in Qtum, please take a look at the Qtum books, technical guidelines, etc. on the [Qtum homepage](qtum.org).

Home networking works easily for most applications, but when you hit a roadblock with your Qtum node, what are you going to do? Your router – firewall – antivirus has many built-in protections to keep you safe with normal Internet activities but running a cryptocurrency wallet may conflict with these built-in safeguards.

We will use the mental model of a “friend request” on social media to explore node connections, where you send a request to someone you want to chat with on Facebook, Telegram, etc. Likewise, your node sends a “friend request” to connect with other nodes, and they send requests to chat with your node.

We will look at what exactly what is a Qtum full node, how the Qtum network works with peer-to-peer connections, and how to override well-meaning firewalls and routers that can block these communications. We will spend some quality time with ports and networking protocols and get intimate with the “netstat” network status tool. I hope that by the time we are done you will understand how your Qtum node can be happily chatting with its peers worldwide.

이 글에서 퀀텀 재단은 초기 디자인 문서를 처음 게시합니다.

커뮤니티가 핵심 기술에 대한 퀀텀의 설계 의도와 구현 세부 사항을 이해할 수 있기를 바랍니다.

이 글은 원본 디자인 초안을 기반으로 합니다.

디자이너의 독창적인 아이디어를 복원하기 위해 후속 퀀텀 프로젝트 팀은 더 한 번 대조하고 해석할 것입니다.

독자가 보다 기술적인 세부 사항을 이해하도록 바랍니다.

계속 지켜봐 주세요!

이 시리즈에 포함될 수 있는 주제는 다음과 같습니다.

* 퀀텀 계정 추상화 계층 AAL
* 퀀텀 분산 자율 프로토콜 DGP
* 퀀텀 지갑 \(qt, 모바일 지갑 등\) 및 브라우저
* 새 RPC 호출
* 상호 이익 합의 메커니즘 MPoS
* 새로운 연산 코드 추가
* EVM 및 퀀텀 블록체인 통합
* 퀀텀 x86 가상 시스템
* 기타 ...

퀀텀 체인 공개 번호는 이 주제를 중심으로 수시로 업데이트됩니다.

퀀텀 프로젝트와 핵심 기술은 처음부터 복원되었으며 지속적인 개선의 역사가 지속적으로 개발되었습니다.

퀀텀 **원래 디자인 문서 요약 \(1\) \-** 퀀텀 **새로운** **연산 코드**

잘 알려졌지만, 퀀텀의 맨 아래 계층은 비트코인과 일치하는 UTXO 모델을 사용합니다.

원래 UTXO 스크립트는 EVM 계정 모델과 호환되지 않습니다.

그래서 퀀텀은 UTXO 거래 스크립트에 세 개의 OP\_CREATE 연산 코드를 추가했습니다.

OP\_CALL 및 OP\_SPEND

UTXO와 EVM 계정 모델 간의 전환에 대한 운영 지원 제공

세 개의 연산 코드의 원래 이름은 다음과 같습니다.

OP\_EXEC\(OP\_CREATE\), OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN\(OP\_CALL\) 및 OP\_TXHASH\(OP\_SPEND\)

다음은 관심 있는 독자를 위한 대표적인 원본 문서의 발췌 부분입니다

**OP\_CREATE \(또는 OP\_EXEC\)**

스마트 계약 생성을 위한 OP\_CREATE \(또는 OP\_EXEC\)

이 연산 코드에 대한 원본 디자인 문서 \(중국어 번역 포함 안함\)는 다음과 같습니다.

\(ps : 퀀텀 \&lt;#\&gt; 또는 퀀텀코어 \&lt;#\&gt;, 내부 설계 문서 번호 매기기 문서에 있음\)

『

`퀀텀코어-3 : 계약 실행을 위한 EVM 및 OP_CREATE 추가`

설명 :이 이야기 후, EVM은 통합되어야 하며 매우 기본적인 계약이 실행될 수 있어야 합니다. 새로운 연산 코드가 있을 것입니다.

OP\_CREATE \(이전 OP\_EXEC\), 4 개의 증명을 취하고, 푸시 순서로:

* 1.VM 버전 \(현재 1은 EVM 임\)
* 2. 가스 가격 \(아직 사용되지 않고 유효합니다\)
* 3. 가스 한도 \(아직 사용되지 않음, 매우 높은 한도로 가정\)
* 4. byte 코드 이제는 블록체인에서 OP\_CREATE 트랜잭션을 위해 이 스크립트 형식을 강제로 작성해야 합니다. \(즉, 블록체인에 허용된 ""표준""만\) OP\_CREATE가 발생하면 EVM을 실행하고 계약을 데이터베이스에 유지해야 합니다. \(시도 됨\)

노트 : 외부 코드에 대한 정책을 준수하는지 확인하십시오. \(바닐라 수정되지 않은 코드를 먼저 실행 한 다음 필요에 따라 변경\)

EVM 테스트 스위트를 기능적으로 만들 수도 있습니다. \(다른 사람이 연속적인 통합 변경을 설정할 수 있습니다\)

』

위의 문서는 OP\_CREATE에 필요한 함수와 사용된 매개 변수를 설명합니다.

**OP\_CALL \(또는 OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN\)**

OP\_CALL은 계약 실행에 사용되며 가장 일반적으로 사용되는 연산 코드 중 하나입니다.

원래 설계 문서에는 많은 설명이 있습니다.

『

`퀀텀6 : OP_EXEC_ASSIGN의 EVM에 호출 환경 정보 구현`

설명 : Solidity는 특정 정보가 ABI의 일부로 스택에 푸시 될 것으로 예상합니다.

따라서 OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN을 사용하여 계약서에 데이터를 보내면 이 데이터를 제공해야 합니다.

이 데이터에는 Solidity ""함수 선택기""는 물론 연산 코드 CALLER 및 ORIGIN 함수가 올바르게 작동하도록 보장합니다.

이것은 매우 쉽습니다. BitCin 스택의 일부 데이터를 EVM 스택으로 전송하고 원본 정보에 대한 일부 필드를 설정해야 합니다.

그러나 이 이야기는 여러 작업으로 나누어져 쉽지 않은 경우 다시 평가해야 합니다.

참고 : [https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum\-Contract\-ABI](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Contract-ABI)

CALLER 및 ORIGIN 값을 채우려면 다음을 수행해야 합니다.

OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN은 SENDER와 SENDER\_SIGNATURE라는 2 개의 추가 인수를

』

위의 문서는 OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN이 EVM에서 구현해야 하는 호출 환경 정보를 설명합니다.

『

`퀀텀8 : 계약서 송금을 위한 OP_EXEC_ASSIGN 구현`

설명 : 새로운 연산 코드 OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN을 추가해야 합니다. 이 연산 코드는 푸시 순서로 다음 인수를 취해야 합니다.

* 버전 번호 \(사용할 VM 버전, 현재는 1 개\)
* 가스 가격 \(지금은 무시할 수 있음\)
* 가스 환불 스크립트 \(현재는 무시할 수 있음\)
* 데이터 \(스마트 계약서에 전달할 데이터. Solidity ABI 기능 선택기 및 CALLERDATA EVM 연산 코드를 사용하여 나중에 사용할 수 있는 기타 데이터 포함\)
* 스마트 계약 주소 \(txid \+ 출력 번호\) 그것은 지금 0과 0의 두 값을 반환해야 합니다.

이것은 각각 소비 가능한 가스와 가스가 없는 것입니다.

쓸모없게 만들고 가스를 다룰 때의 미래 이야기가 될 것입니다.

이 이야기에서 EVM 계약은 실제로 실행될 필요가 없습니다.

이 연산 코드는 계정 시스템이 계약에서 통제할 수 있는 금액을 결정할 수 있도록 자리 표시 자 여야 합니다.

』

위의 문서는 OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN의 구현 세부 사항을 설명합니다.

『

`퀀텀15 : OP_EXEC_ASSIGN 동안 관련 계약서를 실행하십시오.`

설명 :이 이야기가 끝나면 OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN에 도달하면 주소가 부여된 계약서가 실제로 실행되어 비트 퀸 스크립트 스택의 관련 데이터가 전달됩니다.

발신자 및 발신자와 같은 다른 데이터는 추후 이야기를 위해 남겨 둘 수 있습니다.

CALLER, ORIGIN 등의 연산 코드가 올바르게 작동하게 하는 것은 이후의 이야기로 수정될 것입니다.

』

위의 문서는 OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN 스크립트가 관련 계약 코드를 실행하는 방법을 설명합니다.

『

`퀀텀40 : 계약서가공개 키 해시주소로 돈을 송금하도록 허용하십시오.`

설명 : 우리는 계약서가 공캐 키 해시 주소로 돈을 돌려보내도록 허락해야 합니다.

그래서 사람들은 허용되면 동전을 계약에서 인출할 수 있습니다.

이것은 버전 0 계약이 작동하는 방식과 유사하게 작동합니다.

대신 OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN 출력을 사용하는 대신 표준 공캐 키 해시 스크립트를 사용해야 합니다.

그래서, 공캐 키 해시에 다음과 같은 트랜잭션을 블록체인에 배치해야 합니다.

입력 :

\[표준 계약 OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN 입력\]

...

출력 :

OP\_DUP OP\_HASH160 \[pubKeyHash\] OP\_EQUALVERIFY OP\_CHECKSIG

변경 출력 \- 버전 0 OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN 지출 계약으로 돌아가기

이러한 출력물은 지갑 코드 자체를 변경하지 않고 지갑에서 직접 소비할 수 있어야 합니다.

』

위의 문서는 계약서가 퀀텀을 공캐 키 해시 주소로 보내는 것을 허용하는 방법을 설명합니다.

『

`퀀텀코어-10 : 계약서에 다른 전개된 계약을 호출하는 기능 추가`

설명 : 계약은 새로운 OP 코드인 OP\_CALL을 사용하여 다른 계약을 호출할 수 있어야 합니다.

* 푸시 순서의 인자 : 버전 \(32 비트 정수\)
* 가스 가격 \(64 비트 정수\)
* 가스 제한 \(64 비트 정수\)
* 계약 주소 \(160 비트\)
* 데이터 \(길이\) OP\_CALL은 현재 잘못된 것을 반환해야 합니다.

OP\_CALL은 출력에서 사용될 때 계약 실행만 합니다.

OP\_CREATE와 마찬가지로 출력 처리 중에 스크립트를 처리하기 위해 특수 규칙을 사용합니다 \(비트코인에서 정상적으로 보냈을 때보 다\).

트랜잭션 스크립트가 이 표준 형식이고 추가 연산 코드가 없는 경우에만 계약 실행을 트리거 해야 합니다.

잘못된 계약 주소를 사용하는 OP\_CALL이 작성되면 계약 실행이 이루어지지 않아야 합니다.

그러나 트랜잭션은 여전히 ​​블록 체인에서 유효해야 합니다.

OP\_CALL로 돈을 송금 한 경우, 그 금액 \(가스 요금을 뺀 금액\)을 환불 처리하여 환불 금액을 입력 \[0\]의 출력 스크립트로 돌려보내야 합니다.

EVM에 노출된 ""보낸 사람""은 입력 \[0\]에 의해 소비된 공개 키 해시여야 합니다.

입력 \[0\]에 의해 소비된 출력이 공개 키 해시가 아닌 경우 발신자는 0이어야 합니다.

OP\_CALL 입력을 사용하여 계약에 자금을 보낼 수 있습니다.

이 기금은 다른 이야기의 계정 추상화 계층에 의해 처리되어이를 EVM에 표시합니다.

단일 OP\_CALLS는 단일 트랜잭션에서 사용될 수 있습니다.

그러나 계약 이행 전에 각 OP\_CALL 입력의 가스 가격과 가스 한도를 점검하여 거래가 가스를 충당하기에 충분한 거래 수수료를 제공하는지 확인해야 합니다.

또한 계약이 실행되지 않을 때 \(예 : 메모리 풀에서 승인된 경우\) 확인되어야 합니다.

』

위의 문서는 계약서가 OP\_CALL을 통해 다른 계약을 호출하는 방법을 설명합니다.

**OP\_SPEND \(또는 OP\_TXHASH, OP\_EXEC\_SPEND\)**

OP\_SPEND는 계약 잔고 비용으로 사용됩니다.

계약서 주소는 특별한 주소이므로 합의를 이루기 위해 UTXO를 특수하게 처리해야 하기 때문에 원본 설계 문서에 OP\_SPEND 작업 코드에 대한 자세한 설명이 있습니다.

『

`퀀텀20 : 계약서에 돈을 쓸 때 OP_EXEC_SPEND 거래 생성`

설명 : EVM 계약에서 다른 계약금을 보내는 데 사용되는 CALL 연산 코드 또는 유사 코드가 새 거래로 블록체인에 표시되어야 합니다.

계약에서 자금 이체가 이루어지면 광부는 현재 처리 중인 거래가 완료된 후 새로운 거래를 추가해야 합니다.

이 트랜잭션은 redeem 스크립트에서 EXEC\_SPEND를 사용하여 계약 소유의 입력을 사용해야 합니다.

이 이야기의 목적을 위해, 변화가 걱정되어야 할 것이 아니라 많은 투입물이 필요하다고 생각하십시오.

성공한 동전을 적절히 골라내고 원래 계약에 돈을 돌려보내는 것은 나중에 이야기로 나옵니다.

감시해야 할 엣지 케이스 :

계약에 돈을 송금하는 거래는 거래를 실행 한 직후에 이루어져야 합니다.

출력은 버전 \-0 OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN 출력을 사용해야 하므로 트랜잭션이 컨텍스트 외부에서 수신된 경우 여전히 계약을 실행하지 않을 것입니다.

』

위의 문서는 OP\_SPEND 트랜잭션을 생성하는 타이밍을 설명합니다.

『

`퀀텀21 : OP_EXEC_SPEND 트랜잭션에 대해 합의한 핵심 변경 및 동전 선택 알고리즘 생성`

설명 : # 20을 바탕으로 이제 계약에 속한 최적의 출력을 선택하여 소비하는 컨센서스에 중요한 알고리즘을 작성해야 하며 거래에서 변경으로 계약을 다시 반환하는 변경 출력을 작성합니다.

이 경우 모든 출력은 버전 0 OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN을 사용하여 둘 이상의 \(버전 1\) OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN 트랜잭션이 단일 트랜잭션이 되는 것을 방지하는 제한 사항으로 실행되지 않도록 해야 합니다.

트랜잭션에는 필요한 만큼의 입력과 정확히 2 개의 출력이 있어야 합니다.

대상 계약서로 이동하는 첫 번째 출력과 원본 계약서로 다시 변경 사항을 보내는 두 번째 출력.

`퀀텀22 : 트랜잭션 당 EVM 실행을 두 개 이상 허용하지 않습니다.`

설명 : 현저한 엣지 케이스를 피하려면 단일 트랜잭션에서 EVM 실행을 두 번 이상 허용하지 마십시오.

여기에는 배포 및 기금 할당 출력이 포함됩니다.

대신, 그러한 것들은 여러 트랜잭션으로 분할되어야 합니다.

두 번의 EVM 실행이 발생하면 트랜잭션을 완전히 무효로 처리해야 하며 브로드 캐스트 또는 블록 실행에 적합하지 않아야 합니다.

`퀀텀23 : EVM을 실행하지 않는 ""버전 0""OP_EXEC_ASSIGN을 추가하십시오.`

설명 : # 22의 문제를 해결하기 위해 OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN을 사용하여 계약이 실제로 실행되지 않고 계약을 체결할 수 있도록 해야 합니다.

나중에 \(여러\) 계약에 대한 ""변경""출력에 사용됩니다.

OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN에 대해 전달된 버전 번호가 0이면 계약이 실행되지 않습니다.

또한 OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN에 제공된 데이터가 단일 바이트 ""0""인 경우에만 유효합니다.

여러 버전 0 OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN 출력은 트랜잭션에서 유효해야 하며, 버전이 아닌 0 OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN \(또는 OP\_EXEC 배포\)과 여러 버전 0 OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN 출력 있어야 합니다.

이것은 계약에서 다른 계약으로 보내지는 모든 자금 지출에 사용됩니다.

』

위의 세 문서는 합의에 의존하는 코인 피킹 알고리즘이 OP\_SPEND 연산 코드가 합의 오류를 일으키지 않는다고 보장할 경우 변경의 정확성이 보장된다고 설명합니다.

동시에 계약서를 실행할 필요가 없는 상황과 처리 방법을 설명합니다.

『

`퀀텀34 : 코인 베이스 트랜잭션에서 OP_EXEC 및 OP_EXEC_ASSIGN을 허용하지 않습니다.`

설명 : 코인 베이스의 성숙도 문제 및 가스 환불 스크립트 주문의 잠재적 부작용으로 인해 코인 베이스 산출물이 EVM 실행 또는 EVM 계정 잔액 직접 변경으로 귀결되는 것이면 안 됩니다.

여기에는 버전 0 OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN 출력이 포함됩니다.

』

위의 문서에서는 코인 베이스 트랜잭션에 계약 관련 스크립트가 포함되어서는 안된다고 규정하고 있습니다.

**기타 관련 문서**

또한 새 작업 코드에 필요한 인프라를 설명하는 몇 가지 문서가 있습니다.

『

`퀀텀코어-51 : OP_CREATE 및 OP_CALL의 버전 필드를 공식화하십시오.`

설명 : 프로토콜의 향후 확장을 유지하려면 ""버전""인수를 OP\_CREATE 및 OP\_CALL로 변경하여 나중에 새 VM을 업그레이드하고 추가하는 방법에 대한 몇 가지 규칙을 설정해야 합니다.

우리는 현재 ""업그레이드할 때 증분""이상의 VM 버전 형식이 필요합니다.

이렇게 하면 업그레이드 및 소프트 포크를 보다 쉽게 ​​계획 할 수 있습니다.

제안된 분야 :

1. VM 형식 \(앞으로 이 형식을 확장하려면 0에서 증가할 수 있음\) :

* 2 비트 2. Root VM \- EVM, Lua, JVM 등과 같이 사용할 실제 VM : 6 비트
* 3. VM 버전 \- 사용할 루트 VM의 버전 \(하위 호환성을 가진 루트 VM 업그레이드 용\) \- 8 비트
* 4. 플래그 옵션 \- VM 실행 및 AAL 플래그 : 16 비트

합계 : 32 비트 \(4 바이트\). 크기는 모든 EXEC 트랜잭션에 있으므로 중요합니다.

계약 생성을 제어하는 ​​플래그 옵션 비트 : \(OP\_CREATE에만 적용\)

* 0 \(예비\) 고정 가스 일정 \- 참이면 이 계약은 다른 가스 일정을 허용하지 않기로 선택합니다. OP\_CALL을 생성 시 지정된 것과 다른 일정으로 사용하면 즉각적인 예외가 생겨 가스 환불 조건이 종료됩니다
* 1 \(예약\) 계약 관리 인터페이스 사용 \(예약 전용, 나중에 구현 됨 계약을 통해 계약서에서 허용되는 VM 버전 등을 제어할 수 있으며 계약 수명주기 동안 값을 변경할 수 있음\)
* 2 \(예약\) 버전 0 자금 지원 허용 안 함 \-이 계약은 계정 추상화 계층에 필요한 경우를 제외하고 버전 0 OP\_CALL을 통해 수익을 받을 수 없습니다.
* 향후 확장을 위해 사용 가능한 비트 3\-15

계약 통화를 제어하는 ​​플래그 옵션 : \(OP\_CALL에만 적용\)

* \(아직 없음\)

계약서 호출 및 생성을 모두 제어하는 ​​옵션 플래그 :

* \(아직 없음\)

이 플래그는 다음 이야기에서 구현됩니다.

버전 필드는 이제 반드시 4 바이트 푸시 이어야 합니다.

표준 EVM 계약은 이제 버전 번호 \(16 진수\) ""01 00 00 00""을 사용합니다.

컨센서스 동작 :

블록에서 유효한 VM 포맷은 0이어야 합니다.

루트 VM은 모든 값을 가질 수 있습니다.

1은 EVM이고 0은 exec가 아닙니다.

다른 모든 값은 no\-exec \(허용되지만 실행 불능이 되어 나중에 쉽게 소프트 포크를 만들 수 있음\)

VM 버전은 모든 값이 될 수 있습니다 \(소프트 포크 호환성\).

새 버전이 0보다 많이 사용되면 \(0은 초기 출시 버전 임\), 버전 0을 사용하여 실행되고 값을 무시합니다

플래그 옵션은 모든 값이 될 수 있습니다 \(소프트 포크 호환성\). \(비활성 플래그 필드는 무시됩니다\)

표준 메모리 풀 동작 :

VM 형식은 0이어야 합니다.

VM은 0 또는 1VM이어야 합니다.

버전은 0 플래그 옵션이어야 합니다.

모든 유효한 필드를 설정할 수 있습니다.

EVM에 할당되지 않은 모든 필드는 0기본값으로 설정되어야 합니다.

VM 형태 : 0Root

VM : 1

VM 버전 :

0플래그 : 0

』

위의 문서는 공식적으로 OP\_CREATE 및 OP\_CALL이 사용해야 하는 버전 정보를 결정하여 퀀텀에 대한 후속 다중 VM 지원을 위한 길을 열어줍니다.

『

`퀀텀코어-52 : 계약 관리 인터페이스`

설명 : \(주, 이것은 메인 넷에 대한 목표는 아니지만 포함하는 것이 좋습니다\)

계약 자체 내에서 계약의 수명주기를 내부적으로 관리할 수 ​​있어야 합니다.

계약의 수명주기 동안 변경해야 할 수도 있는 이러한 변수 및 구성 값은 다음과 같습니다.

* 허용 가스 스케줄
* 허용되는 VM 버전 \(즉, 향후 VM 버전이 이 계약을 위반하는 경우이 계약을 사용하는 것을 허용하지 말고 과거 VM 버전의 사용이 이 계약과 상호 작용하는 데 사용되지 않도록 하십시오\)
* 생성 플래그 \(OP\_CREATE의 버전 플래그\)

이러한 변수는 모두 분산된 코드를 사용하여 계약 자체 내에서 제어할 수 있어야 합니다.

예를 들어, DAO 시나리오에서는 참가자가 계약 내에서 투표할 수 있는 무언가 일 수 있으며 계약에서 이러한 매개 변수를 변경하는 코드가 트리거 됩니다.

또한 계약은 처음 실행될 때뿐만 아니라 실행 전반에 걸쳐 자체 설정을 감지할 수 있어야 합니다.

이 인터페이스를 특별한 미리 컴파일 된 계약으로 구현할 것을 제안합니다.

그것과 상호 작용하는 계약의 경우 다른 계약과 마찬가지로 Solidity ABI를 사용하여 계약을 호출합니다.

계약서에 ABI 제안 :

* bytes \[2048\] GasSchedule \(int n\)
* int GasScheduleCount \(\)
* AddGasSchedule \(bytes \[2048\]\)
* bytes \[32\] AllowedVMVersions \(\)\`
* void SetAllowedVMVersions \(bytes \[32\]\)\`

대체 구현 :

계약이 특정 방식으로 호출되도록 허용해야 하는지 확인하기 위해 호출되는 특정 Solidity 함수가 있을 수 있습니다.

    pragma solidity ^0.4.0;
    contract BlockHashTest {function BlockHashTest() {
    }function ValidateGasSchedule(bytes32 addr) public returns (bool) {if(addr==""123454"")
    { return true; // 계약 실행 허용}return false; // 계약 실행을 허용하지 않음}function ValidateVMVersion(byte version) public returns (bool){if(version &gt;= 2 &amp;&amp; version &lt; 10) 
    { return true; // 버전 2-9에서 실행하도록 허용합니다. 예를 들어 1에 취약점이 있고 10 명이 계약을 위반했다고 가정해 보겠습니다. 
    }return false; 
    } 
    } 

이런 식으로 계약은 자신의 상태를 관리하는 책임이 있습니다.

기본 작동 방식은 OP\_CALL을 사용하여 계약을 호출할 때 OP\_CALL을 사용하여 이 두 가지 기능을 먼저 실행하고 실행이 가스 비용에 포함된다는 것입니다.

두 함수 중 하나가 false를 반환하면 즉시 가스 상태를 벗어나 실행을 취소합니다.

그러나 ""유효성 검사 VM 버전""콜백을 관리하는 것은 약간 복잡합니다.

사용할 VM 버전을 결정해야 하기 때문입니다.

나쁜 것은 이 기능 자체가 오동작을 일으킬 수 있습니다.

』

위의 문서는 계약의 관리 인터페이스를 설명하고 계약은 자체 상태를 관리할 수 ​​있습니다.

『

`퀀텀코어-53 : 버전 0 전송을 위한 계약에 옵트아웃 플래그 추가`

설명 : 일부 계약에서는 이더리움에 없는 퀀텀의 특정 기능을 거부할 수 있습니다.

이 방법으로 이더리움 계약을 퀀텀 블록체인의 새로운 기능에 대해 걱정하지 않고 퀀텀으로 이식할 수 있습니다.

버전 필드에 플래그 옵션 두 개를 추가해야 계약서를 만들 때 OP\_CREATE에만 영향을 미칩니다.

2. \(첫 번째 비트\) AAL 외부의 본 계약에 대한 ""버전 0""OP\_CALL을 허용하지 않습니다. \(허가하지 않은 버전0\)

 이 기능을 사용하면 ""root VM 0""을 사용하는 OP\_CALL \(실행되지 않음\)이 이 계약서로 보내지는 것이 허용되지 않습니다.

""버전 0""OP\_CALL을 사용하여 이 계약서로 송금을 시도하면 가스 부족 예외가 발생하고 환불해야 합니다.

계정 추상화 계층에서 내부적으로 이루어진 버전 0 지불은 이 플래그의 영향을 받지 않아야 합니다.

이러한 새로운 합의 규칙과 함께 표준 메모리 풀 수표도 있어야 합니다.

1. OP\_CALL tx가 계약 생성과 다른 가스 스케줄을 사용하고 허가하지 않은 동적의 가스 플래그가 설정된 경우 비표준 트랜잭션으로 메모리 풀에서 트랜잭션을 거부해야 합니다.

\(버전 0 지불은 어쨌든 메모리 풀에서 표준 트랜잭션으로 허용되어서는 안됩니다\)

』

위의 문서는 이더리움 계약 코드를 포팅 하기 위해 특정 퀀텀 특정 기능을 무시함으로써 더 나은 EVM 호환성을 얻는 방법을 설명합니다.

따라서 이더리움 생태계의 스마트 계약을 퀀텀과 보다 쉽게 ​​호환 할 수 있습니다.

And this has come up as a common refrain on here. While part of me is thankful that Qtum just sort of quietly ships value and doesn't bother to hype up things too much, another part of me shares the frustration. I believe in Qtum as a platform. I think it's got a great mix of properties, as I've said before: decentralization, proof-of-stake, on-chain governance, multiple VMs, a UTXO transaction model, and solid performance (~70 TPS).

I get that the marketing situation is less than ideal in the U.S. when there are high profile speakers like Charles Hoskinson, Vitalik Buterin, and Dan Larimer, which are actively promoting their projects and touting the various benefits of those chains. We have less of that in the U.S. in part because Patrick is sort of the voice of Qtum and he doesn't direct as many videos towards an English speaking audience. 

But that leaves me to wonder, what can we do as a community to spread the word? To share the vision? To inform people? We are incentivized as holders to make this happen. 

Some ideas I've got to get the conversation started:
1) Record YouTube videos talking about Qtum pros
2) Record videos about Qtum dapps, 
3) Maybe write/record tutorials on how to get started with Qtum, how to use the mobile wallet, how to use some of the best dapps?
4) How to write a dapp for Qtum
5) Porting an ETH app to QTUM?
6) Re-posting editorials from others in the community
7) Sharing interesting developments on /r/cryptocurrency

What else? What other ideas can we come up with to promote Qtum?","false","8g5r7o",NA,0,NA,"false",1529663517,"false","self","t5_3ilam","false","",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/Qtum/comments/8g5r7o/what_can_we_do_as_a_community/","t3_8g5r7o",NA,NA,"","",0,0

&amp;nbsp;


On May 16th in South Korea, the two-day Ninth Asian Leaders Summit was held in Seoul. The founder and CEO of Qtum was represented by the team. He also discussed with the attending industry, commerce, and political elites about the blockchain. The Significance of Innovation to the Development of Human Civilization and the Supervision of Blockchain Technology

&amp;nbsp;

The Asia Leadership Conference, sponsored by Korea’s premier mainstream media—Korea Eye Korea Daily, was founded in 1920. It is the oldest media in the Korean peninsula and has more than 1.77 million daily circulations.

&amp;nbsp;

The summit aims to bring together leaders from industry, business, and political circles from around the world to discuss and resolve important international events that are currently faced by Asia. Since 2005, the Asian Leaders Summit has been successfully held for 8 sessions, attracting politicians and top entrepreneurs such as former U.S. President Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Alibaba founder Jack Ma, renowned media personality Yang Lan and YouTube co-founder Steve Chen. It provided practical and feasible solutions for major international events such as the post-disaster reconstruction of the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2005 and the global economic crisis in 2012.

&amp;nbsp;

At the summit, Patrick Dai made an in-depth discussion with guests at the conference on the significance of blockchain innovation to humanity and the supervision faced by blockchain technology. “In my opinion, blockchain will change people’s values. Bitcoin has already surpassed technology itself and made people reexamine value and wealth.

&amp;nbsp;

Second, blockchain technology has the potential to change the company and business architecture that people have been using for years. The development of bitcoin, Ethereum, and even Qtum can confirm this. Bitcoin has gone through open source for nine years and its market value has exceeded 500 billion U.S. dollars. Apple, which has the highest market value in the world, took 30 years to reach this height. This is worth thinking about. Bitcoin created a brand-new virtual organization structure based on the blockchain consensus, overturning people's inherent asset management methods.

&amp;nbsp;

Finally, I think that blockchain will promote the evolution of technology itself, such as decentralized applications and some application scenarios. One of the most important may be the software market. Many developers develop software on platforms such as the App Store or Google Play. But I believe that in the future, more developers will use more efficient smart contract technology to build applications on the blockchain. ""At the beginning of his career, Patrick Dai said:***"" The Qtum project was launched in 2016 and is considered to be the forerunner of the blockchain industry. Currently, the Qtum ecosystem has more than 1 million users. Developers from more than 70 countries and regions have jointly maintained a network of Qtum Chains and are committed to creating a better blockchain infrastructure for global developers. The application of the ground to lay the foundation. ”***

&amp;nbsp;

When talking about the supervision faced by blockchain technology, Patrick Dai said: ***“At the time of Satoshi Satoshi's initial design of Bitcoin, his ideas were still very ideal. Only a small group of network engineers had joined the industry. With geeks, they are not even aware that they are creating a completely new currency, and the currency attributes of bitcoin may be the government’s most concerned. At present, governments of all countries have implemented different degrees of supervision on digital currency, but in the long run It is necessary to regulate and standardize the market, and the development of blockchain technology itself is a new trend and a new wave, which is unstoppable. So I think that blockchain practitioners and regulators should spend Some time to reach a preliminary consensus and find the right way to ensure the long-term sustainable development of blockchain technology.""***

There are 2303 Heros in the game – I think some of these Heros have been getting busy in the Love Center.

In the Marketplace, there are 219 Heros for sale, most in the 0.2 to 0.5 QTUM range. The top price is for Hero 1,906 for 9,000 QTUM, good luck with that.

Registration codes and registrations seem to be paused for now, watch the Qtum social media channels for user reports when registrations reopen or the 777.Bingo blog for updates on the next wave of registrations.

**Foreword**

In this series of articles, the Qtum Quantum Chain Foundation will make public its early design documents for the first time, hoping to help the community understand the design intent of Qtum and the implementation details of key technologies. The article will be based on the original design draft in order to restore the designer's original ideas. Follow\-up Qtum project team will be further collation and interpretation, to help readers understand more technical details, so stay tuned.

**The topics that may be included in this series include**

\* Qtum account abstraction layer AAL

\* Qtum distributed autonomous protocol DGP

\* Qtum wallet \(qt, mobile wallet, etc.\) and browser

\* Add RPC call

\* Mutual interest consensus mechanism MPoS

\* Add opcode

\* Integration of EVM and Qtum blockchain

\* Qtum x86 virtual machine

\* Others...

The Qtum quantum chain public number will be updated from time to time around the above topics to restore the history of the Qtum project and key technologies from scratch.

**Qtum original design document summary \-\- Qtum new OPCODE**

As we all know, Qtum uses the same UTXO model as Bitcoin. The original UTXO script was not compatible with the EVM account model, so Qtum added three OP\_CREATE, OP\_CALL, and OP\_SPEND opcodes to the UTXO transaction script for the purpose of providing operational support for conversions between UTXO and EVM account models. The original names of the three opcodes are OP\_EXEC\(OP\_CREATE\), OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN\(OP\_CALL\) and OP\_TXHASH\(OP\_SPEND\), respectively.

The following is an excerpt of representative original documents for interested readers.

OP\_CREATE **\(or** OP\_EXEC\*\*\)\*\*

OP\_CREATE \(or OP\_EXEC\) is used to create a smart contract. The original design files \(with Chinese translation\) related to this opcode by the Qtum development team are as follows \(ps: QTUM \&lt;#\&gt; or QTUMCORE\&lt;#\&gt; in the document numbering internal design documents. \):

    QTUMCORE-3：Add EVM and OP_CREATE for contract execution  Description：After this story, the EVM should be integrated and a very basic contract should be capable of being executed. There will be a new opcode, OP_CREATE (formerly OP_EXEC), which takes 4 arguments, in push order: 1. VM version (currently 1 is EVM) 2. Gas price (not yet used, anything is valid) 3. Gas limit (not yet used, assume very high limit) 4. bytecodeFor now it is OK that this script format be forced and mandatory for OP_CREATE transactions on the blockchain. (ie, only ""standard"" allowed on the blockchain) When OP_CREATE is encountered, it should execute the EVM and persist the contract to a database (triedb) Note: Make sure to follow policy for external code (commit vanilla unmodified code first, and then change it as needed)  Make the EVM test suite functional as well (someone else can setup continuous integration changes for it though)

The above document describes the functions required by OP\_CREATE and the parameters used.

## OP_CALL (or OP_EXEC_ASSIGN)

OP\_CALL is used for contract execution and is one of the most commonly used opcodes. There are many descriptions in the original design document.

    QTUM6: Implement calling environment info in EVM for OP_EXEC_ASSIGN

Description: Solidity expects certain information to be pushed onto the stack as part of it's ABI. So, when data is sent into the contract using OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN we need to make sure to provide this data. This data includes the Solidity ""function selector"" as well as ensuring the opcodes CALLER and ORIGIN function properly. This looks to be fairly easy, it should just be transferring some data from the Bitcoin stack to the EVM stack, and setting some fields for the origin info. However, this story should be split into multiple tasks and re\-evaluated if it isn't easy.  See also: [https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum\-Contract\-ABI](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Contract-ABI)  For populating the CALLER and ORIGIN value, the following should be done:  OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN should take 2 extra arguments, SENDER and SENDER\_SIGNATURE. Sender should be a public key. Sender Signature is the signature of all the vins for the current transaction, signed of course using the SENDER value.On the EVM side, CALLER's value will be a public key hash, ie, a hash of the SENDER public key. This public key hash should be compatible with Bitcoin's public key hash for it's standard version 1 addresses.  IF the given SENDER\_SIGNATURE does not match successfully, then the transaction should be considered invalid. If the SENDER public key is 0, then SENDER\_SIGNATURE must also be 0, and the given CALLER opcode etc should just return 0.

The above document describes the OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN calling environment information that needs to be implemented in the EVM.

    QTUM8: Implement OP_EXEC_ASSIGN for sending money to contracts

Description: A new opcode should be added, OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN. This opcode should take these arguments in push order:  # version number \(VM version to use, currently just 1\)

# gas price (can be ignored for now)

# gas refund script (can be ignored for now)

# data (The data to hand to the smart contract. This will include things like the Solidity ABI Function Selector and other data that will later be available using the CALLERDATA EVM opcode) # smart contract address (txid + vout number)

It should return two values right now, 0 and 0. These are for spendable and out of gas, respectively. Making them spendable and dealing with out of gas will be in a future storyFor this story, the EVM contract does not actually need to be executed. This opcode should only be a placeholder so that the accounting system can determine how much money a contract has control of

The above document describes the OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN implementation details.

    QTUM15: Execute the relevant contract during OP_EXEC_ASSIGN

Description: After this story is complete, when OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN is reached, it should actually execute the contract whose address was given to it, passing the relevant data from the bitcoin script stack with it. Other data such as the caller and sender can be left for a later story.  Making the CALLER, ORIGIN etc opcodes work properly will be fixed with a later story

The above document describes OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN how the script runs the relevant contract code.

    QTUM40: Allow contracts to send money to pubkeyhash addresses  Description: We need to allow contracts to send money back to pubkeyhash addresses, so that people can withdraw their coins from contracts when allowed, etc.  This should work similar to how version 0 contract sends work. Instead of using an OP_EXEC_ASSIGN vout though, we need to instead use a standard pubkeyhash script.  So, upon spending to a pubkeyhash, the following transaction should be placed on the blockchain:  vin:  [standard contract OP_EXEC_ASSIGN inputs]  ...  vout:  OP_DUP OP_HASH160 [pubKeyHash] OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG  change output - version 0 OP_EXEC_ASSIGN back to spending contract   These outputs should be directly spendable in the wallet with no changes to the wallet code itself

The above document describes how to allow contracts to send QTUM to pubkeyhash addresses.

    QTUMCORE-10：Add ability for contracts to call other deployed contracts  Description：Contracts should be capable of calling other contracts using a new opcode, OP_CALL. Arguments in push order:version (32 bit integer) gas price (64 bit integer) gas limit (64 bit integer) contract address (160 bits) data (any length) OP_CALL should ways return false for now. OP_CALL only results in contract execution when used in a vout; Similar to OP_CREATE, it uses the special rule to process the script during vout processing (rather than when spent as is normal in Bitcoin). Contract execution should only be triggered when the transaction script is in this standard format and has no extra opcodes. If OP_CALL is created that uses an invalid contract address, then no contract execution should take place. The transaction should still be valid in the blockchain however. If money was sent with OP_CALL, then that money (minus the gas fees) should result in a refund transaction to send the funds back to vin[0]'s vout script. The ""sender"" exposed to EVM should be the pubkeyhash spent by vin[0]. If the vout spent by vin[0] is not a pubkeyhash, then the sender should be 0.Funds can be sent to the contract using an OP_CALL vout. These funds will be handled by the account abstraciton layer in a different story, to expose this to the EVM. Multiple OP_CALLS can be used in a single transaction. However, before contract execution, the gas price and gas limit of each OP_CALL vout should be checked to ensure that the transaction provides enough transaction fees to cover the gas. Additionally, this should be verified even when the contract is not executed, such as when it is accepted in the mempool.

The above document describes how the contract calls other contracts via OP\_CALL.

## OP_SPEND (or OP_TXHASH, OP_EXEC_SPEND)

OP\_SPEND is used for the cost of the contract balance. Because the contract address is a special address, in order to ensure consensus, the UTXO needs to be specially processed. Therefore, there are more descriptions of the OP\_SPEND operation code in the original design document.

    QTUM20: Create OP_EXEC_SPEND transaction when a contract spends money

Description: When a CALL opcode or similar to used from an EVM contract to send another contract money, this should be shown on the blockchain as a new transaction. When a money transfer is done in the contract, the miner should add a new transaction exactly after the currently processing transaction in the block. This transaction should spend an input owned by the contract by using EXEC\_SPEND in it's redeemScript. For the purposes of this story, assume change is not something to be worried about and consume as many inputs are needed. Properly picking effecient coins and sending back money to the originating contract will come in a later story.  Edge cases to watch for:  The transaction for sending money to the contract must come directly after the executing transaction. The outputs should use a version\-0 OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN vout, so that if the transaction were received out of context, it would still mean to not execute the contract.

The above document describes the timing of creating a OP\_SPEND transaction.

    QTUM21: Create consensus-critical change and coin-picking algorithm for OP_EXEC_SPEND transactions  Description: Building on #20, now a consensus-critical algorithm must be made that picks the most optimal outputs belonging to the contract, and spends them, and also makes a change output that returns the ""change"" from the transaction back to the contract. All outputs in this case should be using a version-0 OP_EXEC_ASSIGN, to avoid running into the limitation that prevents more than one (version 1) OP_EXEC_ASSIGN transaction from being in a single transaction. The transaction should have as many vins as needed, and exactly 2 vouts. The first vout to go to the target contract, and the second vout to send change back to the source contract.  

QTUM22: Disallow more than one EVM execution per transaction

Description: In order to avoid significant edge cases, for now, disallow more than one EVM execution to take place in a single transaction. This includes both deployment and fund assignment vouts. Instead, such things should be split into multiple transactions  If two EVM executions are encountered, the transaction should be treated as completely invalid and not suitable for broadcast nor putting into a block

QTUM23: Add ""version 0"" OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN, which does not execute EVM  Description: To counteract problems from #22, we should allow OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN to be used to fund a contract without the contract actually being executed. This will be used later for ""change"" outputs to \(multiple\) contracts.  If the version number passed in for OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN is 0, then the contract is not executed. Also, this is only valid if the data provided to OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN is just a single byte ""0"".  Multiple version\-0 OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN vouts should be valid in a transaction, or 1 non\-version\-0 OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN \(or an OP\_EXEC deployment\) and multiple version\-0 OP\_EXEC\_ASSIGN vouts.  This will be used for all money spending that is sent from a contract to another contract

The above three documents describe that if the consensus\-associated coin\-picking algorithm guarantees that the OP\_SPEND opcode does not cause a consensus error, the correctness of the change is ensured. At the same time, it describes the situation where the contract does not need to be run and how it is handled.

    QTUM34: Disallow OP_EXEC and OP_EXEC_ASSIGN from coinbase transactions  Description: Because of problems with coinbase maturity and potential side effects from ordering of gas-refund scripts, it should not be legal for coinbase outputs to be anything which results in EVM execution or directly changing EVM account balances. This includes version 0 OP_EXEC_ASSIGN outputs.

The above document stipulates that coinbase transactions should not include contract\-related scripts.

In addition, there are some documents describing the infrastructure needed for the new operation code.

    QTUMCORE-51：Formalize the version field for OP_CREATE and OP_CALL  Description：In order to sustain future extensions to the protocol, we need to set some rules for how we will later upgrade and add new VMs by changing the ""version"" argument to OP_CREATE and OP_CALL.  We need a definitive VM version format beyond our current ""just increment when doing upgrades"". This would allow us to more easily plan upgrades and soft-forks. Proposed fields:

1. VM Format \(can be increased from 0 to extend this format in the future\): 2 bits2. Root VM \- The actual VM to use, such as EVM, Lua, JVM, etc: 6 bits
2. VM Version \- The version of the Root VM to use \(for upgrading the root VM with backwards compatibility\) \- 8 bits
3. Flag options \- For flags to the VM execution and AAL: 16 bits Total: 32 bits \(4 bytes\). Size is important since it will be in every EXEC transaction Flag option bits that control contract creation: \(only apply to OP\_CREATE\) • 0 \(reserve\) Fixed gas schedule \- if true, then this contract chooses to opt\-out of allowing different gas schedules. Using OP\_CALL with a gas schedule other than the one specified in it's creation will result in an immediate exception and result in an out of gas refund condition • 1 \(reserve\) Enable contract admin interface \(reserve only, this will be implemented later. Will allow contracts to control for themselves what VM versions and such they allow, and allows the values to be changed over the lifecycle of the contract\) • 2 \(reserve\) Disallow version 0 funding \- If true, this contract is not capable of receiving money through version 0 OP\_CALL, other than as required for the account abstraction layer. •	bits 3\-15 available for future extensions Flag options that control contract calls: \(only apply to OP\_CALL\) •	\(none yet\) Flag options that control both contract calls and creation: •	\(none yet\) These flags will be implemented in a later story Note that the version field now MUST be a 4 byte push.  A standard EVM contract would now use the version number \(in hex\) ""01 00 00 00"" Consensus behavior:  VM Format must be 0 to be valid in a block Root VM can be any value. 1 is EVM, 0 is no\-exec. All other values result in no\-exec \(allowed, but the no execution, for easier soft\-forks later\)   VM Version can be any value \(soft\-fork compatibility\). If a new version is used than 0 \(0 is initial release version\), then it will execute using version 0 and ignore the value Flag options can be any value \(soft\-fork compatibility\). \(inactive flag fields are ignored\) Standard mempool behavior: VM Format must be 0Root VM must be 0 or 1VM Version must be 0Flag options \- all valid fields can be set. All fields that are not assigned must be set to 0Defaults for EVM: VM Format: 0Root VM: 1VM Version: 0Flags: 0

The above documents formally identified OP\_CREATE and OP\_CALL needed version information, paving the way for subsequent multi\-virtual machine support for Qtum.

    QTUMCORE-52：Contract Admin Interface Description：(note, this isn't a goal for mainnet, though it would be a nice feature to include) It should be possible to manage the lifecycle of a contract internally within the contract itself. Such variables and configuration values that might need to be changed over the course of a contract's lifecycle:  •	Allowable gas schedules

•	Allowable VM versions \(ie, if a future VM version breaks this contract, don't allow it to be used, as well as deprecating past VM versions from being used to interact with this contract\) •	Creation flags \(the version flags in OP\_CREATE\) All of these variables must be able to be controlled within the contract itself, using decentralized code. For instance, in a DAO scenario, it might be something that participants can vote on within the contract, and then the contract triggers the code that changes these parameters. In addition, a contract should be capable of detecting it's own settings throughout it's execution as well as when it is initially created.  I propose implementing this interface as a special pre\-compiled contract. For a contract ot interact with it, it would call it using the Solidity ABI like any other contract.  Proposed ABI for the contract: •	`bytes[2048] GasSchedule(int n)` •	int GasScheduleCount\(\) •	int AddGasSchedule\(bytes\[2048\] •	bytes\[32\] AllowedVMVersions\(\) •	void SetAllowedVMVersions\(bytes\[32\]\) Alternative implementations: There could be a specific Solidity function which is called in order to validate that the contract should allow itself to be called in a particular manner:  pragma solidity 0.4.0; contract BlockHashTest {function BlockHashTest\(\) { }function ValidateGasSchedule\(bytes32 addr\) public returns \(bool\) {if\(addr==""123454""\) { return true; //allow contract to run }return false; //do not allow contract to run}function ValidateVMVersion\(byte version\) public returns \(bool\){if\(version \&gt;= 2 &amp;&amp; version \&lt; 10\) { return true; //allow to run on versions 2\-9. Say for example 1 had a vulnerability in it, and 10 broke the contract }return false; } }  In this way a contract is responsible for managing it's own state. The basic way it would work is that when a you use OP\_CALL to call a contract, it would first execute these two functions \(and their execution would be included in gas costs\). If either function returns false, then it immediately triggers an out of gas condition and cancels execution.  It's slightly complicated to manage the ""ValidateVMVersion"" callback however, because we must decide which VM version to use. A bad one could cause this function itself to misbeha\`ve.\`\`\`\`\`\`\`

pragma solidity ^(0.4.0;) contract BlockHashTest {function BlockHashTest\(\) { }function ValidateGasSchedule\(bytes32 addr\) public returns \(bool\) {if\(addr==""123454""\) { return true; //allow contract to run }return false; //do not allow contract to run}function ValidateVMVersion\(byte version\) public returns \(bool\){if\(version \&gt;= 2 &amp;&amp; version \&lt; 10\) { return true; //allow to run on versions 2\-9. Say for example 1 had a vulnerability in it, and 10 broke the contract }return false; }

    }

The above document describes the management interface of the contract, and yes the contract can manage its own status.

    QTUMCORE-53：Add opt-out flags to contracts for version 0 sends  Description：Some contracts may wish to opt-out of certain features in Qtum that are not present in Ethereum. This way more Ethereum contracts can be ported to Qtum without worrying about new features in the Qtum blockchain Two flag options should be added to the Version field, which only have an effect in OP_CREATE for creating the contract:  2. (1st bit) Disallow ""version 0"" OP_CALLs to this contract outside of the AAL. (DisallowVersion0)  	If this is enabled, then an OP_CALL using ""root VM 0"" (which causes no execution) is not allowed to be sent to this contract. If money is attempted to be sent to this contract using ""version 0"" OP_CALL, then it will result in an out of gas exception and the funds should be refunded. Version 0 payments made internally within the Account Abstraction Layer should not be affected by this flag. Along with these new consensus rules, there should also be some standard mempool checks:

1. If an OP\_CALL tx uses a different gas schedule than the contract creation, and the disallow dynamic gas flag is set, then the transaction should be rejected from the mempool as a non\-standard transaction \(version 0 payments should not be allowed as standard transactions in the mempool anyway\)

The above document describes how to get better EVM compatibility by ignoring certain Qtum specific features in order to port Ethereum contract code. This makes smart contracts in the Ethereum ecosystem more easily compatible with Qtum.

## summary

The Qtum original design document presented above describes Qtu's increased opcode associated with the contract run, laying the groundwork for subsequent Qtum's EVM VMs that are compatible with the account model on top of the UTXO model, and also making the account abstraction layer AAL possible. The subsequent Qtum project team will further interpret the key documents. If you have any questions, readers can post comments in the comments area or contact the Qtum project team .

The Qtum quantum chain public number will be updated from time to time around the above topics to restore the history of the Qtum project and key technologies from scratch .

we will push Qtum once again to massive adoption.. earlier, because the regulation risk in china, we slow down the marketing plan since December of 2017, then we focused on development work since the beginning of 2018, but we realized we still need more efforts on marketing. we will push this happen, also we welcome community to contribute more ideas and more works to Qtum Project, we will do big bounty to the community members.  here is some facts about Qtum: 1 it's the first Working POS smart contact Platform with 7000 nodes over 56  country. 2 it's TPS  is 70-100, while bitcoin is 3-5, Ethereum is 15-20.  3 it's compatible with EVM, that means all 
Ethereum Contracts can easily run on Qtum network with cheaper gas and higher TPS  4 it's based on the UTXO model, Different from Account model, In UTXO, you can process the transaction parallelly, like you can send 1 Qtum to 1000 different receiver address same time, while in account model, you can only send coin to 1 account.  4 Qtum have the unique DGP Technology, you can use smart contract to involve a smarter Governance than hard fork.  5 we have some real working Dapps on Qtum, like Bodhi and Ink and more than 50 Dapps on Qtum, not like some Projects only have a smart contact and they call it a Dapp.  6 we are working to release the X86 Virtual Machine, it can support C/C++/RUST to write smart contacts in Qtum Ecosystem.  7 The QtumX Version have an alpha Version now, the blocktime is 10s and can support more than 1000 TPS  8 Qtum is one of the most decentralized and most Secure Blockchain, it the third largest Blockchain Nodes network, while bitcoin have 13000 full nodes and Ethereum have 20000 full nodes and Qtum have 7000 POS full nodes  9 Qtum implemented the stable and secure wallet solution, We have Qtum Core QT wallet which support Qtum and Qtum Staking and QRC20 token, We have Qtum SPV Electrum wallet,  which support Qtum and QRC20 and Ledger Wallet, We have Qtum web wallet, which support Qtum and QRC20 and Ledger, We have Qtum IOS and Android wallet and more than 5 third party wallet （Qbao, beechat, bither, hyperpay and more）          10 We realized we are building the best technology in this industry, but we did not put enough efforts on the marketings and community management, we will improve this soon!    thanks for the support.","false","8nbfou",NA,0,NA,"false",1529792347,"false","self","t5_3ilam","false","",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/Qtum/comments/8nbfou/patricks_message_to_the_community/","t3_8nbfou",NA,NA,"","",0,0

The following link provides detailed account of the event from a participant. Although I can't vouch for the veracity of the information 100&amp;#37; because I didn't attend the event, it seems legit enough to me.

[https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/dfy5xlZJm6Y6ZP6TrVYHnQ](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/dfy5xlZJm6Y6ZP6TrVYHnQ)

(I came across the above link courtesy of Korean Qtum community: [https://qtum.or.kr/free/989394](https://qtum.or.kr/free/989394))

I don't speak Chinese so had to use Google Translate. However, I found the Q&amp;A section particularly interesting and improved the following English translation myself to post here. If a Chinese speaker wants to suggest any changes, please feel free to do so.

(1) Qtum is collaborating with Qbao and plans to launch a blockchain game based on Qtum in Korea. Qbao is  currently the second largest crypto wallet in the country in terms of Google Store downloads.

(2) Qtum's collaboration with Qihoo 360 has been ongoing. But due to the latter being a publicly listed company, information disclosure following the announcement has been limited so far.

(3) Qtum will collaborate with the Korean exchange, Bithumb, which will build a global presence, aka Bithumb Overseas Version (?). The new exchange will come with a Qtum market (Qtum/XXX) and Qtum  will provide the necessary technical support. More information will follow.

Well, it is great to hear some very positive news during the period of severe market downturn, and I hope that Qtum will make a nice recovery when the overall market sentiment improves. I'm particularly encouraged by a possible Qtum market in a mega exchange, which will help alleviate the difficulties many QRC\-20 DApps are currently facing with regard to exchange listing (see the relevant thread \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/8kpz7q/qtum\_most\_under\_rated\_project/dz9vkca](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/8kpz7q/qtum_most_under_rated_project/dz9vkca)).",NA,"8q3rfk",NA,0,NA,"false",1536360125,"false","self","t5_3ilam","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/Qtum/comments/8q3rfk/interesting_news_from_beijing_meetup_in/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

I’m working on my cryptocurrency analytic[ project](https://coinsocialstory.com/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=qtum%20checking), where I rate cryptocurrencies and tokens by different criteria – such as price, social, development and network.��

Also, I want to put the history of each coin in it, and here I might need your help!  
If you can tell me something about the Qtum history, it would be very cool. You can write me here or on my email address: [coinsocialstory@gmail.com](mailto:coinsocialstory@gmail.com). ✨

Remark: it could be implemented like this that  per default the two passwords are identical so nothing changes if one only wants one password. However an option that can be enabled in the GUI could make the creation of two differnt passwords possible

The team cites 3 reasons for the decision:

\- Superior transaction handling

\- Upcoming x86 VM

\- Proven POS

The IAME system will allow participants in blockchain transactions to verify each other's identities without having to disclose non-essential, sensitive personal information, and also ensure that they are not unwittingly involved in any illicit activity. For further details on the project, see [https://iame.io/](https://iame.io/)

I found about this great news courtesy of Korean Qtum community site ([https://qtum.or.kr/free/1040926](https://qtum.or.kr/free/1040926)), and even more encouragingly, Patrick himself also shared the news with a hint that more projects are likely to follow suit :)

EDIT:

Yes, I'm very pleased to see a project coming to Qtum thanks to the platform's technological merits. But personally speaking, I'm not yet quite convinced by the project after going through the white paper and the team member/advisor/partner list. (Granted, it's still very early days and I'll keep tabs on its progress down the road.) Anyway, the project is currently offering private sales that only accepts Qtum, and I do wish the team and prospective investors best of luck!",NA,"8srdd9",NA,0,NA,"false",1536412446,"false","self","t5_3ilam","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/Qtum/comments/8srdd9/iame_transaction_identification_framework_is/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

The scalability of block chain is the key to realize massive transaction. The Current Bitcoin network can achieve a maximum of 7 processing power per second, the Qtum network can now achieve Bitcoin 10 with the processing power,But forMassive transactions are not enough (e-commerce applications, for example, in recent years Alibaba dual 11 shopping festival, Alipay network Peak transactions over 100000 transactions per second (TPS), Visa on the 2013 holiday period, the implementation of 47000 transactions per second (TPS)).In order to solveThe processing and storage problems brought about by this massive transaction, Joseph Poon presents a lightning network (lightning Network) solution, Lightning Networkis a centralized system, no need to trust each other and a third party can achieve real-time, massive network of transactions. The basic idea is that the trading parties in the chain through the trading script to create payment channels, after the two sides real-time, massive payment transactions in the chain completed, through the link to a number of channels can achieve any two points between the fund transactions, the completion of value transfer, without the trust of the third party for funds and settlement These transfers can be carried out along the routing path between untrusted parties through a contract.

C-lightning is a reference implementation of the Lightning network on the Bitcoin block chain, and can now support the payment channel creation, receiving and payment functions of the Lightning network. Qtum on the basis of c-lightning made a corresponding modification to form a qtum-lightning, so that under qtum can also achieve such as channel creation, real-time transactions, small transactions and other functions. The following tests are performed on these lightning network functions through the Qtum backbone Network (mainnet).

**1. Test environment**

Two sets of Ubuntu 16.04 of computers, installed with Qtum core and qtum-lightning. Qtum-core is used to connect the qtum backbone network, qtum-lightning the node to achieve the Lightning network function.

**2. Lightning Network Test**

This test, through a node and B-node to establish a payment channel to achieve real-time, small payment function, the main process includes: Capital preparation, connection establishment, channel establishment, payment transactions. The test realized the funds to deposit 0.1QTUM to the channel and paid 0.00000001 qtum from Node B to Node A.

**2.1 Get information for two nodes First get information about the node for subsequent operations:**

Node A:192.168.77.188

{ ""id"" : ""0298b904689755a051441f1a8828e5d3aa46633cac21bc6bd8ce75328508e71ec0"", ""port"" : 9735, ""network"" : ""Qtum"", ""version"" : ""a787b86"", ""blockheight"" : 28906 }

Node B:192.168.77.76

{ ""id"" : ""03977a1862418d6989453f8f1fc793120830463b1beda1e951e39e947ec09f2208"", ""port"" : 9735, ""network"" : ""qtum"", ""version"" : ""a787b86"", ""blockheight"" : 28927 }

**2.2 Create a payment channel**

The channel of Lightning Network is to realize the start of the chain trading, after the channel is established, it can realize the transaction under the chain, no need to broadcast to the chain. The creation process is to store the money that is used to establish the channel in the wallet address that is managed by the node, and to join the pool of funds, after which you can create a lightning network channel using a portion of the fund pool amount.

**Prepare a sum of money:**

First send the funds to node B node with address: cli/lightning-cli newaddr # to get a new address return: MUNPTmB7U8phjeibPDooKzVfsa2CQGPuME qtum-cli sendtoaddress MUNPTmB7U8phjeibPDooKzVfsa2CQGPuME 0.3 # deposit 0.3 QTUM funds

**Get transaction records:**

**Node B deposits 0.1QTUM funds into the channel:**

Cli/lightning-cli fundchannel ""0298b904689755a051441f1a8828e5d3aa46633cac21bc6bd8ce75328508e71ec0"" The actual value of 10000000 funds needs to be divided by 100000000 is based on QTUM pricing.

**2.3** Making payments in the lightning network channel The payment process in the lightning network channel is initiated by the receiving side. The receiving party A first generates a receipt of its own receipt, and then the sending party B can obtain a value from B to the amount of the paid payment. A's payment routing, according to the routing information, can send itself to the A node.

Produce QTUM receipt document at node A: cli/lightning-cli invoice 1 a # Receive 0.00000001 QTUM Return:

{ ""rhash"" : ""3b8d42fb10dd451f42babcc962c17c12b9163dd2b03a1f12f968789bb80c1cf2"" }

At the Node B, the route to the A node to send funds is:

Cli/lightning-cli getroute 0298b904689755a051441f1a8828e5d3aa46633cac21bc6bd8ce75328508e71ec0 1 1 Back:

{

""route"" :

\[

{ ""id"" : ""0298b904689755a051441f1a8828e5d3aa46633cac21bc6bd8ce75328508e71ec0"", ""channel"" : ""28926:2:0"", ""msatoshi"" : 1, ""delay"" : 36 }

\]

}

Send an amount of 0.00000001 QTUM to node A from node B:

Cli/lightning-cli sendpay '\[ { ""id"" : ""0298b904689755a051441f1a8828e5d3aa46633cac21bc6bd8ce75328508e71ec0"", ""channel"" : ""28926:2:0"", ""msatoshi"" : 1, ""delay"" : 36 } \]' 3b8d42fb10dd451f42babcc962c17c12b9163dd2b03a1f12f968789bb80c1cF2

**3 Check the result after payment**

In the lightning network channel, payments can be settled immediately. After node B sends a sendpay to A, the new allocation result of the channel's funds is generated in real time. You can check the distribution of channel funds by viewing the information of nodes A and B.

**A node**

Cli/lightning-cli getpeers

return:

{ ""peers"" :

\[

{ ""unique\_id"" : 9, ""state"" : ""CHANNELD\_AWAITING\_LOCKIN"", ""netaddr"" : ""::ffff:192.168.77.76:51860"", ""peerid"" : ""03977a1862418d6989453f8f1fc793120830463b1beda1e951e39e947ec09f2208"" , ""connected"" : true , ""owner"" : "" Lightning\_channe ld"" , ""msatoshi\_to\_us"" : 1 , ""msatoshi\_total"" : 10000000000 } \] }

It can be seen that the A node received 0.00000001 QTUM, the total amount of the channel is unchanged, there is no formalities.

**Node B**

Cli/lightning-cli getpeers

return:

{

""peers"" :

\[

{ ""unique\_id"" : 10, ""state"" : ""CHANNELD\_NORMAL"", ""netaddr"" : ""[192.168.77.188:9735](https://192.168.77.188:9735/)"", ""peerid"" : ""0298b904689755a051441f1a8828e5d3aa46633cac21bc6bd8ce75328508e71ec0"", ""connected"" : true, ""owner"" : ""lightning\_channeld"", "" chanNel"" : ""28926:2:0"" , ""msatoshi\_to\_us"" : 9999999999 , ""msatoshi\_total"" : 10000000000 } \] }

After Node B stores 0.1QTUM and sends 0.00000001QTUM before sending it, it still has 0.09999999QTUM remaining. At the same time, the total amount of the channel seen does not change.

Through the above tests, it can be seen that the Qtum-based lightning network can basically realize real-time transactions and settlements under the chain. Only transactions involving two parties can be used without paying commissions, making it possible to make payments such as small payments. Theoretically, by setting up a large number of lightning network channels under the Qtum chain and placing transactions under the chain, real-time, massive transactions can be realized.",NA,"8u5h7u",NA,0,NA,"false",1536449491,"false","https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/kGJ47Zh_3I2wL6XAJjjjA9JUt1MeGhaUmm5i-7pIuIw.jpg","t5_3ilam","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/Qtum/comments/8u5h7u/introduction_and_test_of_lightning_network/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/0pXoUjXZnqJaAdM4vywvlA

As we mentioned in the previous chapters, Qtum uses a layered design, using Qtum AAL, so that the Ethereum virtual machine EVM can run on the underlying UTXO model to be compatible with Ethereum's smart contracts. However, EVM itself has many limitations, and is currently only compatible with a high-level language such as Solidity for smart contract writing. Its security and maturity still require time verification. The Qtum AAL was designed to be compatible with multiple virtual machines at the beginning of the design, so after the initial compatibility with the EVM, the Qtum team was committed to compatibility with the more mainstream architecture of the virtual machine, which in turn was compatible with mainstream programming languages and toolchains.

The Qtum x86 virtual machine is the development focus of the Qtum project in 2018. It aims to create a virtual machine compatible with the x86 instruction set and provide similar operating system level calls, aiming to push smart contract development into the mainstream.

The following section intercepted some of the original Qtum development team's original design documents for the Qtum x86 virtual machine (with Chinese translation) (ps: document QTUM &lt;#&gt; or QTUMCORE&lt;#&gt; for internal design document numbering):

***The above series of tasks implements most of the necessary opcodes for the x86 lib kernel part (x86lib). These are the basics for the virtual machine to recognize and run x86 instructions and function as an emulator for x86 instructions.***

**QTUMCORE-105: \[x86lib\] Research how to do automated testing for x86lib**

**Description:** Research and look for viable ways to do automated testing of x86lib's supported opcodes

**Task:** How to Automatically Test x86lib

**Description:** Study and find possible ways to automate x86lib supported opcodes

***The Qtum team achieved automated testing of the x86 virtual machine kernel through the above tasks, because the parsing and running errors of the underlying instructions are often difficult to find through debugging, and must use some automated testing tools. This ensures the correctness of the x86lib kernel.***

**QTUMCORE-109:\[x86\] Add ""reason"" field for all memory requests**

**Description:** In order to prepare for the upcoming gas model, a new field needs to be added to every memory access. This field basically gives the reason for why memory is being accessed so that it can be given a proper gas cost. Possible reasons:

Code fetching (used for opcode reading, ModRM parsing, immediate arguments, etc)

Data (used for any memory reference in the program, such as mov \[1234\], eax. also includes things like ModRM::WriteWord() etc)

Internal (used fro any internal memory reading that shouldn't be given a price.. probably not used right now outside of testbench/testsuite code)

This ""reason"" code can be place in MemorySystem(). It shouldn't go in each individual MemoryDevice object

**Task:** \[x86\] Add ""reason"" field to all memory requests

**Description:** In preparation for the gas model to be used, a new field needs to be added to each memory access. This field basically gives the reason why the memory was accessed so that the appropriate gas cost can be given.

Possible reasons are:

• Capture code (for opcode reads, ModRMB parsing, instant parameters, etc.)

• Data (used for memory references in programs such as mov\[1234\], eax, and operations similar to ModRM::WriteWord(), etc.)

Internal request (for any internal memory read that does not need to consume gas... currently only used in testbench/testsuite code)

The ""reason"" code can be placed in MemorySystem(). It should not be placed in any single MemoryDevice object.

***The above task is mainly aimed at the Qtum x86 new gas model, and separate fields are reserved for different types of memory access requests. Currently only used to verify the feasibility, in the future will be used to calculate the actual gas price.***

**QTUMCORE-114: \[x86\] Add various i386+ instructions**

**QTUMCORE-118: Implement remaining opcodes in x86lib**

**Description:** The remaining opcodes that do not result in an error or change of behavior should be implemented with unit tests. Take particular care and use many references for some of the weird opcodes, like nop\_rm32.

**Task:** Implementing remaining x86lib opcodes

Description: The remaining opcodes that do not cause errors or behavior changes should be implemented through unit tests. Take special care and refer to some weird opcodes, such as nop\_rm32.

***The above series of tasks further adds support for i386+ opcodes and implements the rest of the necessary remaining opcodes. At this point x86lib can already support most i386+ instructions***

**QTUMCORE-117: Begin leveldb-backed database for x86 contracts**

**Description:** For this story, the code work should done as a sub-project from Qtum Core, and can be done direclty in the Qtum Core github. For now, unit and integration tests should be used to confirm functionality. It will be integrated into Qtum Core later. You might need to modify Qtum Core some so that the project is built with proper dependencies. This story will implement the beginnings of a new database that will be used for smart contracts. This will only store meta-data, contract Bytecode, and constructor data for right now:

The leveldb dataset for this data should be named ""contracts"". The key for this dataset should be a 256-bit contract address (exact format will be specified later) awarded as a hex string.

The value data should contain the following:

• txid of contract creation (with this the chainstate db can be used to lookup blockhash)

• VM version

• contract creation parameters (see ""contract deployment"" page in design)

• contract creation data (the constructor data)

• contract bytecode

The interface for reading and writing into this database should be clear and extensible. Although it is being designed for the x86 VM, other VMs in the future will also use it.

**Task:** Implementing a leveldb database in an x86 contract

**Description:** For this task, code should be written in the Qtum Core subproject and can be done directly on the Qtum Core github. Currently, unit tests and integration tests should be used to confirm the correctness of the function. The following code will be integrated into Qtum Core. It may be necessary to modify the Qtum Core appropriately so that the project has the appropriate dependencies. This task will implement a prototype of a new database that can be used for smart contracts. This database currently only stores meta-data, contract bytecode, and constructor data.

The data leveldb data set should be named ""contract."" The key of the data set should be the contract address of a 256-digit hexadecimal string (the specific format will be specified later).

Value data should contain the following sections:

• Contract created transaction id (chain state database can use it to find block hash)

• Virtual Machine Version

• Contract creation parameters (see ""Contract Deployment"" page in the design)

• Contract creation data (constructor data)

• Contract bytecode

The interface for database reads and writes should be clear and extensible. Although designed for x86 virtual machines, other virtual machines can be used in the future.

***The above task implements the most basic leveldb database available for x86 contracts. Currently, this database only stores some specific data such as contract codes, which can be expanded in the future. In addition, the design emphasizes the universality of the interface and facilitates the invocation of other virtual machines in the future.***

**QTUMCORE-119: Research needed functions in Qtum's version of libc**

**Description:** We should evaluate the C99 standard library specifications to determine which functions should be supported in the x86 VM, with easy to use tooling provided to developers (ie, a custom toolchain). List the headers and functions that are common enough to warrant support , as well as is agnostic to the operating system, or can some way fit into the operating system like model of Qtum's x86 VM.

**Task:** To study the functions required in the libc version of Qtum

**Description:** We should evaluate the C99 standard library specification to determine which features should be supported in the x86 virtual machine and make it easier to use the tools provided to the developer (for example, a customized tool chain). Lists the most common function headers and functions that must be supported. These function headers and functions are agnostic to the operating system, or to some extent suitable for operating systems similar to the Qtum x86 virtual machine model.

***Based on the c99 standard library specification, the Qtumx86 virtual machine implements a simplified version of the libc library for use by smart contract developers.***

**QTUMCORE-126: \[x86\] \[Compiler\] Figure out and document a way of compiling/packaging the QtumOS GCC toolchain for Windows, Linux, and OSX**

**Description:** We should evaluate the C99 standard library specifications to determine which functions should be supported in the x86 VM, with easy to use tooling provided to developers (ie, a custom toolchain). List the headers and functions that are common enough to warrant support , as well as is agnostic to the operating system, or can some way fit into the operating system like model of Qtum's x86 VM.

**Task:**\[x86\]\[Compiler\] Finding and documenting a way to compile/package QtumOS GCC toolchain for Windows, Linux and OSX

**Description:** As a contract developer, I don't want to compile the QtumOS toolchain when developing x86 virtual machine contracts.

For this task, study and document how to build the QtumOS GCC toolchain for Windows, Linux and OSX. Using this toolchain on all platforms should have the same experience. Following this document, anyone should be able to compile the pre-built version of GCC.

***In order to use the same compiler tool for any common platform, the above task implements a cross-platform, pre-compiled gcc tool for smart contract developers***\*.\*

**QTUMCORE-127: \[x86\] \[libqtum\] Add basic blockchain data APIs**

**Description:** As a contract devleoper, I want to be capable of getting basic blockchain data like network weight without needing to know how to write assembly code.

For this story, create a new project for libqtum to compile to libqtum.a using the QtumOS compiler, and place all definitions in a qtum.h file. The first operations to be added are some basic system calls for the following:

• Access to past 256 block hashes

• Block gas limt

• MPoS staking address for block (only the 0th address indicating the block creator)

• Current block difficulty

• Previous block time

• Current block height

These functions are not yet built into the x86 VM or Qtum, so these will just be mocks for now that can't be beta until later.

API list:

previousBlockTime() -&gt; int32 – syscall(0)

• blockGasLimit() -&gt; int64 – syscall(1, &amp;return);

• blockCreator() -&gt; address\_t – syscall(2, &amp;return);

• blockDifficulty() -&gt; int32 – syscall(3);

blockHeight() -&gt; int32 – syscall(4);

• getBlockHash(int number) -&gt; hash\_t (32 bytes) – syscall(5, number, &amp;return);

Note, this inline assembly code can be used as a template for safely using the ""int"" opcode from C code, and should be capable of being put into a .S assembly file and used via:

//in C header

Extern long syscall(long syscall\_number, long p1, long p2, long p3, long p4, long p5, long p6);

//in .S file

User mode

.global syscall

Long syscall(long number, long p1, long p2, long p3, long p4, long p5, long p6)

Syscall:

Push &amp;#37;ebp

Mov &amp;#37;esp, &amp;#37;ebp

Push &amp;#37;edi

**Task:**\[x86\]\[libqtum\]Add basic blockchain data APIs

Description: As a contract developer, I hope to obtain basic blockchain data, such as network weight, without writing assembly code.

For this task, create a new project for libqtum, compile to libqtum.a using the QtumOS compiler, and put all definitions in the qtum.h file. The first operation that needs to be added is the basic system call to the following:

• Access to past 256 block hashes

• Block gas limit

• MPoS staking address of the block (only the creator of the 0th address indicator block)

• Current block difficulty

• Time of previous block

• The height of the current block

These features have not yet been built into x86 virtual machines or Qtum, so these are only temporary simulations that can be tested later

API list:

previousBlockTime() -&gt; int32 – syscall(0)

• blockGasLimit() -&gt; int64 – syscall(1, &amp;return);

• blockCreator() -&gt; address\_t – syscall(2, &amp;return);

• blockDifficulty() -&gt; int32 – syscall(3);

blockHeight() -&gt; int32 – syscall(4);

• getBlockHash(int number) -&gt; hash\_t (32 bytes) – syscall(5, number, &amp;return);

Note that this inline assembly code can be used as a template for safely using the ""int"" opcode of C code and should be able to be put into an .S assembly file and used by:

//in C header

Extern long syscall(long syscall\_number, long p1, long p2, long p3, long p4, long p5, long p6);

//in .S file

User mode

.global syscall

Long syscall(long number, long p1, long p2, long p3, long p4, long p5, long p6)

***The basic data of the blockchain is very useful for smart contract writing, but it is very difficult for ordinary smart contract developers to obtain this data without providing more tools. The above task provides an API for acquiring basic block data, enabling developers to quickly obtain relevant block data, thereby improving the efficiency of smart contract development.***

**QTUMCORE-128: \[x86\] \[VM\] Add very basic gas system**

**Description:** As a contract devleoper, I want to test how intensive my prototype x86 smart contracts will be on a real blockchain.

For this story, add a very basic gas model to the x86 VM. There should be a new option added to Execute() that allows for specifying an absolute gas limit that execution will error upon hitting. It should also be possible to retrieve how much Gas was used during the execution of the program. For this basic gas model, each instruction is 1 gas. It is ok if there are edge cases where an instruction might not be counted.

**Task:** \[x86\]\[VM\] Adds the Most Basic Gas System

Description: As a contract developer, I want to test the strength of my prototype x86 smart contract on the real blockchain.

For this task, add a very basic gas model to the x86 virtual machine. There should be a new option added to Execute() that allows you to specify an absolute gas limit, as long as you reach that value and you will get an error. It should also be possible to calculate how much gas is used during program execution. For this basic gas model, each instruction is 1gas. It is also possible if there are boundary scenes where the instruction may not be calculated.

***The above task implements the most basic gas system of the x86 virtual machine, and can be used to calculate the specific consumed gas of the contract in the real blockchain.***

**QTUMCORE-129: \[x86\] \[DeltaDB\] Add very basic prototype version of DeltaDB**

**Description:** As a contract developer, I want my prototype x86 contracts to persist within my own personal blockchain so that I can do more than just execute them. I need to be able to call them after deployment.

Right now, we will only concern ourselves with loading and writing contract bytecode. The key thus should be ""bytecode\_&amp;#37;address&amp;#37;"" and the value should be the raw contract bytecode. The contract bytecode will have an internal format later so that bytecode, constant Data, and contract options are distinguishable in the flat data.

The exposed C++ class interface should simply allow for the smart contract VM layer to look up the size of an address's code, load the address's code into memory, and write code from memory into an address's associated data store.

Look at how the leveldb code works for things like ""txindex"" in Qtum and model this using the Bitcoin database helper if possible. There is no need for this to be tied to consensus right now. It is also also to ignore block disconnects and things That would cause the state to be reverted in the database.

Please do all work based on the time/qtumcore0.15 branch in Qtum Core for right now. Also, for the format of an ""address"", please look for ""UniversalAddress"" in the earlz/x86-2 branch, and copy the related Code if needed.

**Task:** \[x86\]\[DeltaDB\] Add the most basic version of the DeltaDB prototype

**Description:** As a contract developer, I hope that my prototype x86 contract can exist in my own blockchain so that all I can do is not just run them. I hope to be able to call them after deployment.

For now, we only care about loading and writing contract bytecodes. Therefore, the key should be ""bytecode\_&amp;#37;address&amp;#37;"" and the value should be the original contract bytecode. Contract bytecodes will have an internal format so that bytecode, constant data, and contract options can be distinguished in flat data.

The exposed C++ class interface should allow the smart contract virtual machine layer to look up the size of the address code, load the address code into memory, and write the code from memory into the address's associated data store.

Look at how the leveldb code for things like ""txindex"" in Qtum works, and if possible, model it using the Bitcoin database helper. There is no need to associate this issue with consensus. It is also possible to temporarily ignore the disconnection of the block and cause the state of the database to recover.

Now do all the work based on Qtum Core's time/qtumcore0.15 branch. In addition, for the ""address"" format, look for ""UniversalAddress"" in the earlz/x86-2 branch and copy the relevant code if necessary.

***The above task adds the most basic database DeltaBD to the x86 virtual machine, which can be used to store contract status and is a necessary condition for contract invocation***\*.\*

**QTUMCORE-130: \[x86\] \[UI\] Add ""createx86contract"" RPC call**

**Description:** As a smart contract developer, I want to be capable of easily deploying my contract code no too much worrying.

In this story, add a new RPC call named ""createx86contract"" which accepts 4 arguments: gas price, gas limit, filename (ELF file), and sender address.

The ELF file should be tore apart into a flat array of data refer the contract data to be put onto the blockchain.

1. int32 size of options
2. int32 size of code
3. int32 size of data
4. int32 (unused)
5. options data (right now, this can be empty, and size is 0)
6. code memory data
7. data memory data

Similar ELF file processing exists in the x86Lib project and that code can be adapted for this. Note that there should be some way of returning errors and warnings back to the user in case of problems with the ELF file.

After the contract data is extracted and built, a transaction output of the following type should be constructed (similar to create contract)

&lt;gasprice&gt; &lt;gaslimit&gt; &lt;contractdata&gt; OP\_CREATE

The RPC result should be similar to what is returned from createcontract, except for a warnings/errors field should be included, and the contract address should be a base58 x86 address, and any other fields invalid for x86 should be excluded

**Task:** \[x86\]\[UI\] Add ""createx86contract"" RPC Call

**Description:** As a developer of smart contracts, I hope to deploy my contract code very simply.

In this task, a new RPC call named ""createx86contract"" is added, which accepts four parameters: gas price, gas limit, filename (ELF file), and the sender address.

The ELF file should be split into a set of data indicating that the contract data was placed on the blockchain.

1. int32 size of options (options, shaping 32-bit size)
2. int32 size of code (code, shaping 32-bit size)
3. int32 size of data (data, integer 32-bit size)
4. int32 (not used)
5. options data (options data, now empty, size 0)
6. code memory data
7. data memory data

There is a similar ELF file processing in the x86lib project, and its code can be modified according to the requirements here. Note that when there is a problem with the ELF file, there should be some way to return errors and warnings to the user.

After extracting and building the contract data, a transaction output of the following type will be constructed (similar to createcontract)

&lt;gasprice&gt; &lt;gaslimit&gt; &lt;contractdata&gt; OP\_CREATE

The RPC result should be similar to the one returned in createcontract, except that it contains a warning/error field, and the contract's address should be a base58 encoded x86 address. Any other fields that are invalid for x86 should be excluded.

***The above task adds a new qtum rpc call, namely createx86contract. The rpc can load smart contracts directly from the elf executable file and deploy it to the blockchain. It also adds error return mechanisms to allow developers to know the contract deployment status.***

**summary**

This chapter contains the most critical implementation details of the Qtum x86 virtual machine. Based on these tasks, the Qtum team has implemented the first virtual machine that can deploy and run x86 smart contracts. It also provides tools for writing smart contracts in C language. The prototype now supports writing contracts in C language. The implementation of the Qtum x86 virtual machine continues, and the follow-up Qtum project team will continue to expose the original design documents.

What is the minimum amount of QTUM to stake for it to actually be worth it? (I know technically you only need 1 QTUM to stake but you'd probably never earn a payout)

How long did it take you earn a reward?

The most recent claimed to work through an IOU system and claimed to be secure (ie, that they couldn't run away with the money)

I'd like to caution everyone about such systems. A true decentralized and trustless PoS system is impossible by design on Qtum. During Qtum's design we carefully evaluated potential ways to enable this to be done, but ultimately they all compromised the security of the PoS consensus system in some way. So, we explicitly left it impossible to be done. 

The design of Qtum's PoS system REQUIRES that any coins that can be staked by a party, must also be capable of being spent by them. This means IOU and other ""decentralized"" security mechanisms put in place are impossible to be done in a trustless way. Any such system possible requires that the party doing the staking is capable of running away with the money. 

I am not saying that PoS staking pools are all scams etc. However, you should treat them with the same amount of trust as an exchange. They all have the ability to run away with any Qtum that is sent to them. 

The only staking pool design we have come up with that can not run away with your coins is not currently implemented, but is possible today. This design would basically require the user to keep a device with their keys online. The ""pool"" would monitor the blockchain, when it finds a block, it would send a stake tx to the user for them to sign it. The user would send it back, and then it can be made into a valid block. The only privileged information that would be given to the pool is a public key. (note that the signing application must still be carefully audited to ensure it does not sign arbitrary transactions). If anyone would like to implement this, feel free to PM me about ideas. 

TL;DR; Decentralized and trustless staking pools are impossible. If you send them your coins there is nothing to stop them from running away with the tokens. They are not necessarily a scam, but you should only send coins if you absolutely trust them.

This would necessarily require storage and insurance fees to be accrued. Because I would like the token to trade freely and to be able to be stored in cold wallets, it seems to me that the only reasonable solution is to have a smart contract that basically takes a tiny bit of each token each period (day, week, month, whatever) and sends it back to the contract owner to pay the storage fees. Any other arrangement I can think of, such as deducting storage fees along with transaction fees only when a transaction is made, risks somebody holding the assets for a very long period of time, or even forever without ever paying any fees. It also helps deal with the sticky situation of lost keys, so at least you will be always paid to store the goods even if nobody can ever retrieve them.

Can such a token be created on Qtum?

The main requirements are as follows:

1. Period payment in kind storage fee is returned to contract owner.
2. Transaction fee of 0.xx&amp;#37; every time the tokens move from one address to another is sent to the contract owner.
3. There is a redemption fee of course, if anybody wants to claim the goods, however that is easily to deal with by just making an online market place for the goods where they are essentially ""purchased"" for tokens and the price is marked up above and beyond the true asset value to cover the fees.

Quick reminder that next week is our **first hackathon webinar on August 2nd**. We'll be diving into the challenges, technology, and providing a Q&amp;A to ask any questions you might have so far. We'll be hosting this at 2 separate times (same webinar, two chances to join depending on time zones/schedules). Links to add these events to your calendar are:

Welcome to click on QtumX Enterprise Edition to learn more:

**Create enterprise-class application features - one-click chain**

The QtumX Enterprise Edition was born, and we expanded its capabilities to help it completely change the operating model of each industry, quickly and easily deploy the underlying framework of the blockchain at the enterprise alliance level, and add a one-click chain to focus on the function. In terms of its function, we will find out which of the most important attributes to consider when choosing a solution for the industry. The following five advantages will analyze these attributes one by one.

As a key feature of QtumX Enterprise Edition, the one-click chain is now in beta, using container technology to host smart contracts that make up the system's application logic. In short, the one-click chain function will help more and more Industry and company to build their own business empire.

**Threshold of the business empire - licensed member of the alliance**

In many business scenarios, especially in the financial and medical industries, there are many nodes in the network that need to be authorized and licensed, and the licensing and authorization of other alliance members is the basic threshold for joining the business empire, and it is necessary to comply with national data. Protecting the law, to inform the alliance of the digital identity of specific data reading, just as private investors in the financial industry are often an alliance venture capital, to authorize each other's capital credibility to participate in the QtumX Enterprise Edition.

**High performance, high availability, high flexibility**

QTUMX Enterprise Edition is compatible with the Ethereum Smart Contract Ecology, and is compatible with all existing technologies in the market that have been validated and future Qtum, including x86 virtual machines, and in which transactions between different blocks of our different nodes will automatically conform to corporate transactions. The scenario, the size of the block to which the option fits, the transaction speed of the block, and the underlying flexible blockchain layer help lower the level of trust and verification required between different node types, and the network scalability and performance are optimized. In the real business scenario, buying stocks or bonds can choose different transaction processing methods, and in the exchange alliance, the one-click chain can dynamically join any licensed bank in the peer node, realizing the business alliance. Dynamic growth.

**Data disclosure is publicized as an authorization list**

At the beginning, the seven major technology companies in the business world were mentioned. The reason why they have huge black holes will only go in and not share. However, due to the rules of data competition such as competition situation, laws and cooperation agreements, enterprises need to protect multiple parties. Hierarchical data, different alliance enterprises ""need to know"" database is not the same, one-click hairline will be the same as the TV pay channel mode to pass the data that needs to be known to the designated relevant receiver.

**Alliance incentive ecology**

**How to better achieve ecological self-control and related self-discipline?**

This requires the TOKEN with incentives in the alliance. This will result in the alliance members having mutual supervision, mutual reward and mutual management mode, maximizing the self-management management of the complete alliance ecology, and the one-click chain function will satisfy all The incentive TOKEN that you want to implement in a business scenario.

**User security and identity management**

It seems that this near-perfect enterprise solution is really meaningful for C-side users. The one-click chain of security modules uses QtumX technology to support the protection and management of digital keys for strong authentication, and supports the handling of various situations, such as the need for more protected identity management for different levels of security users.

I originally hopped into the discord but the moderators there were unable to help. They suggested I come here in hopes that a dev may be around to help.

I'm currently running the most recent qtumcore-node with the insight-api. However, I'm running into an issue with the AddressBalanceService where the node is throwing an exception ""Method not found"" when it tries to run getAddressBalance on the node. See error below:

`[2018-07-05T18:15:48.324Z] error: [AddressBalanceService] Update Error { RPCError: Method not found`

If anyone has any insight on what might be the issue here, I could really use some help. Can provide configs/logs as needed. I had this working on node v8 with a previous version of the insight-api, but since upgrading to the latest version and using the suggested nodejs v6 this has become an issue. The ERC20 Watcher and statistics services are running just fine, its only the addressbalance service that is broken at the moment.",NA,"8wcrwh",NA,0,NA,"false",1536486949,"false","self","t5_3ilam","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/Qtum/comments/8wcrwh/issues_with_qtuminsightapi/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

**About Qtum**

**Moderator** : Please briefly describe the Qtum for everyone.

**Patrick Dai** : Qtum is essentially an open source smart contract platform that combines the Bitcoin UTXO model with the Ethereum virtual machine. Using Qtum's first account abstraction layer (AAL) to achieve the seamless interaction of these two more mature blockchain ecosystems, the core value of Bitcoin and Ethereum, and the two major functions of currency and platform Important attributes while avoiding the waste of resources caused by repeated wheel building in the blockchain ecosystem.

**Qtum  Core Competitive Advantage**

**DAPP Ecological Construction**

**Moderator** : so for the Qtum , you are more focused on building a smart contract platform, which will lead to more commercial Dapps. Is that true?

**Patrick Dai**  : The goal of Qtum  is to create a value transfer protocol that allows each user to transfer peer-to-peer values ​​through the Qtum Platform. Qtum is also committed to building a decentralized Dapp platform. I personally think that many commercial applications don't actually need to be decentralized, such as cloud services, and more focused on efficiency. This is intrinsically contradictory to decentralization, so most of the Qtum ecosystem is currently Practically, it essentially requires high trust costs to decentralize projects in the field.

**Pos Consensus Advantage**

**Moderator** : You first mentioned the PoS consensus mechanism used by the Qtum. You can simply explain what PoS is, and where is its advantage?

**Patrick Dai**  : All blockchains are distributed, decentralized systems, so proper consensus algorithms are very important. In the 1950s and 1960s, some famous big companies began to use some algorithms to maintain their data consensus. By 2008, Nakamoto had first introduced the concept of a miner incentive mechanism, which is Bitcoin's workload proof mechanism (PoW). Although even now, from a mathematical point of view, PoW can't guarantee that all proofs are correct, it works because it is based on game theory and incentives. But the negative impact of the PoW consensus mechanism is that the energy it consumes is huge, and in the long run it does not meet the requirements of sustainable development. Therefore, in order to have more blockchain commercial application scenarios in the future, we have considered the Probability Mechanism (PoS) as a consensus mechanism for environmental and business friendly and lower thresholds. Many people can participate in the construction of the entire network. Qtum unlike some other blockchains that use the DPoS consensus mechanism, the DPoS blockchain requires users to vote for other more powerful nodes with more assets and able to verify transactions, which forms a super node. The presence. But for the Qtum, this doesn't exist. Any node (even if you only have 10 QTUMs) has the power to participate in verifying transaction information across the network. So this is a huge difference between the two. I think the most important thing for the blockchain is to achieve a point-to-point symmetric network. Anyone's rights and interests should be equal.

**Blockchain Market**

**Moderator** : What do you think of the current digital currency market?

**Patrick Dai**  : I think the current market performance is normal and is expected. Looking back at the collapse of the Nasdaq bubble, many companies have fallen more than 90&amp;#37;.The current blockchain market is obviously more speculative. Many people buy Tokens and trades on exchanges without understanding the nature of the project. But the blockchain is still at a very early stage, even bitcoin. I think the market performance of digital currency has been a warning to everyone, reminding investors to calm down and rethinking the practical application of blockchain technology. **I think this is also the best time for innovative companies to find solutions to some practical problems, rather than being dominated by speculative markets.**

**Moderator** : Many people think that blockchain and Linux have similarities. What is your opinion?

**Patrick Dai**  : I personally tend to compare the blockchain consensus with Linux and decentralized banks. I have learned about the experience of the founder of Linux. He has predicted for the next decade that the Internet will be replaced by something that has better incentives. At the time of developing the Linux system, he realized that it would be very difficult for open source software to maintain long-term development. Nakamoto first valued the consensus, which subverted the traditional corporate structure. **All big companies have borders** , but now with these open source consensus, the boundaries of business depend on consensus, how many people can go without Some people's consent can be added to your consensus without any problems. **So, I think blockchain technology requires a decentralized operational system to define what value is and at the same time handle the transmission of value.** So, this subverts people's inherent thinking and is also revolutionary in the long run.

**Imagination Of The New Era**

**Moderator** : Many people think that the development of the Internet has deviated from the original track. What do you think of it?

**Patrick Dai**  : I don't think this point is unreasonable. At the beginning of the Internet, there were concepts of the underlying and upper-level solutions. The underlying layer is the consensus layer, HTTP, SMTP. These services and solutions are open source, free, and developed by a small group of geeks. But as we enter the 21st century, some Internet giants have begun to rise. For example, big companies like Microsoft and Google are aiming to maximize their own interests, so they begin to control all resources and everything that can bring them benefits.

**This is a bit contrary to the initial heart of the Internet. The Internet is also decentralized, but now it is becoming more and more centralized because of the relationship between the upper layers of business, and this centralization problem cannot be underestimated. It may It will affect every aspect of life and even people's thoughts.** I think blockchain technology may be the only way to get back to the original vision and ideas of the Internet.

**Moderator** : What do you think is the biggest problem that blockchain technology can solve? In other words, what is the best application scenario for the blockchain?

**Patrick Dai**  : At present, the most successful and also the earliest application scenario is digital currency. Bitcoin has created a new currency attribute, and now has a market value of more than 100 billion US dollars. The second promising application I think is **authentication** . In this respect, I think that international collaboration can be opened to create online authentication, and people no longer need to use passports and ID cards. Third, blockchain technology can also be applied to the **financial industry** to promote the upgrading of the company's organizational structure, which of course needs to be based on a legal system.

**Moderator** : Although the blockchain industry has developed rapidly since last year, it has not seen killer applications based on blockchain technology so far. What bottlenecks do you think are currently developing in the blockchain, and what are the main challenges?

**Patrick Dai**  : First of all, the technical challenges, I have said more than once that the current **blockchain technology is still in the early stage** , and many core technologies are still immature. The second point I think is the compliance regulatory system. There is no such problem in software development, but this is only for the Internet era. **However, in the blockchain era, all projects have issued their own tokens, so in the long run, it is necessary to properly regulate the blockchain industry.**

**Qtum original design document summary (3) -- Account Abstraction Layer (AAL)**

In the first two articles, we reviewed the birth of Qtum's newly defined opcode and Qtum's preliminary preparations for integrating the Ethereum virtual machine EVM. Ethereum is an account-based blockchain system, while Qtum is based on the Bitcoin UTXO model. In order to solve the problem of the difference between the two transaction models, the account abstraction layer (AAL) is added to the design of the quantum chain, so as to maximize the original function of the original bitcoin and be compatible with the existing Ethereum smart contract. .

In fact, the role of AAL is far more than just getting through Bitcoin and Ethereum. The account abstraction layer AAL can theoretically be used on any blockchain project like the Bitcoin UTXO model and is compatible with any virtual machine based on the account model. Subsequent Qtum development teams will refactor AAL to be compatible with more virtual machines, such as x86 virtual machines being developed by Qtum, and other virtual machines that may be adapted in the future.

In this chapter, we will restore the original QTD development team's original design document related to the account abstraction layer AAL (with Chinese translation) as follows (ps: QTUM&lt;#&gt; or QTUMCORE&lt;#&gt; in the document is the internal design document number):

**QTUMCORE-47: Add Account Abstraction Layer for contracts**

**Description**: The account abstraction layer is a way for EVM contracts to work on the UTXO based blockchain. This story should cover nearly the entire module.

The condensing transaction will spend any existing contract vouts which require their balance to be changed, and the outputs will be The new balance of the contracts.

The condensing transaction is created so that a contract never owns more than 1 UTXO. This significant simplifies coin picking, and prevents many attack vectors with filling up a block.

There may be more than 1 condensing transaction per block. In the case of a single contract having multiple balance changes in a block, a condensing transaction might spend a previous condensing transaction's outputs in the same block. This is slightly wasteful but reduces the complexity of Logic required, and allows for easily adding more contract execution transactions without needing to rewrite any previous transactions.

An ITD for the full behavior with all known edge cases is here: [https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum-itds/blob/master/aal/condensing-transaction.md](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum-itds/blob/master/aal/condensing-transaction.md)

**Task:** Add the contract's account abstraction layer (AAL)

**Description:** The Account Abstraction Layer (AAL) is a solution that enables EVM contracts to work on UTXO-based blockchains. This task covers almost the entire module.

You can use OP\_CALL to send funds to the contract. When a contract receives or sends funds, it should result in a ""condensing transaction."" The transaction will cost any existing contract vouts and cause their balance to change, and outputs will become the new balance of the contract.

The condensing transaction is created to make the contract have no more than one UTXO. This greatly simplifies coin picking and can prevent attacks by filling up blocks.

There can be more than one condensing transaction in each block. In the case where a single contract has multiple balance changes in a block, the condensing transaction may spend the output of the previous condensing transaction in the same block. This is a bit of a waste but can reduce the complexity of the logic and simply add more contracts to run the transaction without rewriting any of the previous transactions.

See the ITD for the operation of all known boundary scenarios:

 [Https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum-itds/blob/master/aal/condensing-transaction.md](Https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum-itds/blob/master/aal/condensing-transaction.md)

*The above task describes the account abstraction layer as a whole. Since many preparations have been completed, the task does not describe too much implementation details. Interested readers can refer to the relevant design documents in the previous two series of articles. The condensing transaction mentioned here is a very important concept that avoids the inability to reach consensus due to differences in the order in which the contract balances are selected.*

**QTUMCORE-54: Add tests for Account Abstraction Layer for contracts**

**Description:** Cover with tests Account Abstraction Layer change QTUMCORE-47 DONE

**Task:** Test the account abstraction layer of the contract

**Description:** including the modification of the account abstraction layer in QTUMCORE-47, also to test

*The above tasks are mainly to completely test the newly designed account abstraction layer to ensure that it is safe before going online. Since the Qtum main online line, the account abstraction layer has been working stably, mainly due to sufficient testing before going online.*

**QTUMCORE-58: Add additional AAL and Condensing TX validation rules**

**Description:** We have just implemented the AAL. However, it's validation rules are not completely secure yet. We should do the following when receiving a block with condensing executions:

Implementing this will allow us to remove previous OP\_TXHASH one by one checks (no need for double execution), and will allow the validation of all VM future tx types (including the recent validation condensing transaction ITD).

0. First make sure stateRoot and utxoRoot hashes are part of the block hash computation.

1. Process block using checkblock, and all other checks needed before validating transaction scripts and contract execution
2. Create a completely new block, copying all header info from the original block
3. Add coinbase and stake transactions from original block
4. Add 1 transaction at a time from original block, executing contracts as needed

Any expected OP\_TXHASH transactions should be added to the block in-order of creation. If there is an unexpected OP\_TXHASH tx in the original block, it should be rejected (This might be changed later for soft-fork compatibility)

6. Process every transaction until none remain

7. Create new merklehash and place in blockheader

8. Compute state root hashes etc EVM state data

9. Compare the new block's hash to the old block's hash

10. If the new block's hash matches, then accept it. Otherwise, reject the block

Pseudo-code:

{code:java}

Block = receiveBlock();

CheckBlock(block)

testBlock = new Block();

testBlock.header=block.header

testBlock.MerkelRoot=0; //make 0 because no transactions in block yet

Foreach(tx in block){

    If(tx.hasExec()){

        testblock.Add(tx) //add contract tx to block

        Result = tx.exec();

        If(result.hasOpHashTx()){

            Foreach(opHashTx in result){

                testblock.Add(opHashTx); //add resulting condensing tx from contract execution (I think there can be more than 1 if a single tx has multiple EVM execs?)

            }

        }

    }else if(tx.isContractSpend()){

        //don't add spends

    }else{

        testblock.Add(tx) //add any other tx type, non-standard, pubkeyhash, etc

    }

}

testBlock.calculateMerkelRoot();

testBlock.calculateStateRoots();

Assert(testBlock.hash() == block.hash())

{code}

**Task:** Add additional account abstraction layers and Condensing transaction validation rules

**Description:** We have just implemented the Account Abstraction Layer (AAL). However, its validation rules are not completely secure. When we receive the block that condensing runs, we should do the following:

Implementing this feature will allow us to remove the previous OP\_TXHASH through a check (no need to run again) and allow verification of future transaction types for all virtual machines (including recent condensing transaction ITD verification)

0. First make sure the stateRoot and utxoRoot hashes are part of the block hash operation

1. Use the checkblock to process the block, as well as all other checks required before the transaction script validation and contract run
2. Create a brand new block and copy all block header information from the original block
3. Add coinbase and stake transactions from the original block
4. Add 1 transaction from the original block at a time, run the contract as needed
5. Any expected OP\_TXHASH transactions should be added to the block in the order they were created. If an unexpected OP\_TXHASH appears in the original block, it should be rejected (this may need to be modified later, in order to support soft fork compatibility)
6. Process each transaction until all transactions have been processed
7. Create a new merklehash and place it in the block header
8. Calculate EVM status data such as state root hashes
9. Compare the new block hash with the old block hash
10. If the new block hash matches, accept it. Otherwise, reject the block

Pseudo code:

{code:java}

Block = receiveBlock();

CheckBlock(block)

testBlock = new Block();

testBlock.header=block.header

testBlock.MerkelRoot=0; //make 0 because no transactions in block yet

Foreach(tx in block){

        testblock.Add(tx) //add contract tx to block

        Result = tx.exec();

        If(result.hasOpHashTx()){

            Foreach(opHashTx in result){

                testblock.Add(opHashTx); //add resulting condensing tx from contract execution (I think there can be more than 1 if a single tx has multiple EVM execs?)

            }

        }

    }else if(tx.isContractSpend()){

        //don't add spends

    }else{

        testblock.Add(tx) //add any other tx type, non-standard, pubkeyhash, etc

    }

}

testBlock.calculateMerkelRoot();

testBlock.calculateStateRoots();

Qtum is designed with a bitcoin UTXO-based account model and implements a smart contract that supports the EVM specification, which is done through the Account Abstract Layer (ALA). AAL adapts the UTXO account to the EVM contract account, so that the AAL can use the UTXO transaction output to create a smart contract on the chain, send the transaction to the contract account to trigger the execution of the contract, and the AAL will eventually execute after the execution. The results were processed and adapted to UTXO. Thanks to the AAL, contract developers don't need to care about the UTXO transformation details related to contract operations, they can use the features of EVM to develop and are compatible with existing Ethereum smart contracts. This paper first analyzes the working process of AAL by interpreting the implementation code from UTXO transaction to smart contract execution.

Qtum has added three opcodes OP\_CREATE, OP\_CALL and OP\_SPEND for UTXO trading scripts to provide operational support for conversion between UTXO and EVM account models. These opcodes are defined in the opcodetype enumeration type:

&amp;nbsp;

Enum opcodetype{

        ......

        OP\_CREATE = 0xc1,

        OP\_CALL = 0xc2,

        OP\_SPEND= 0xc3,

        ......

        }

&amp;nbsp;

These three opcodes have the following effects:

OP\_CREATE is used to create smart contracts;

OP\_CALL is used for the execution of the contract;

OP\_SPEND is used for the cost of the contract balance.

In order to identify and process the transactions controlled by these opcodes during the block generation process, the HasCreateOrCall() and HasOpSpend() functions are added to the class CTransaction for UTXO model transactions for use in the mempool in the new block. The transaction is processed and the corresponding processing is added to the EvalScript() function of the script opcode parsing.

&amp;nbsp;

**2. Conversion of UTXO transactions to EVM model transactions**

When generating new blocks, in addition to regular parameter legality, consensus rules, DDOS attack checks, etc. for UTXO transactions, it is also necessary to use the opcode check function HasCreateOrCall() to determine whether the transaction output contains OP\_CREATE or OP\_CALL, which respectively correspond to EVM needs to perform contract creation or contract calls. This section has the following processing:

&amp;nbsp;

**2.1 Performing account parameter extraction for EVM model**

The contract uses the data, gasPrice, gasLimit, and VM version parameters in the execution of the EVM. These parameters are sent by the RPC call sendtocontract. The sendtocontract generates a UTXO transaction and uses the OP\_CALL opcode in the transaction output. Will be broadcast to the blockchain network. The adaptation from UTXO to EVM in AAL is implemented by the QtumTxConverter class, in which the member functions extractQtumTransactions() and parseEthTXParams() of the class complete the parameter extraction for all such UTXO transaction output. The code fragment is as follows:

&amp;nbsp;

Dev::Address receiveAddress;

    Valtype vecAddr;

    If (opcode == OP\_CALL)

    {

        vecAddr = stack.back();

        Stack.pop\_back();

        receiveAddress = dev::Address(vecAddr);

    }

    Valtype code(stack.back());

    Stack.pop\_back();

    Uint64\_t gasPrice = CScriptNum::vch\_to\_uint64(stack.back());

    Stack.pop\_back();

    Uint64\_t gasLimit = CScriptNum::vch\_to\_uint64(stack.back());

    Stack.pop\_back();

    VersionVM version(CScriptNum::vch\_to\_uint64(stack.back()));

    Stack.pop\_back();

    Return EthTransactionParams{version, dev::u256(gasLimit), dev::u256(gasPrice), code,

                 receiveAddress }

&amp;nbsp;

The above code first judges that if the opcode is OP\_CALL, the contract with the address vecAddr has been created, so it is directly converted into the address of the EVM format receiveAddress, otherwise it is OP\_CREATE, the corresponding contract is created, there is no such field, so no extraction is done. Next, the data, gasPrice, gasLimit, and VM version are extracted in turn, which are all essential parameters for the EVM to execute bytecode.

&amp;nbsp;

**2.2 Transaction conversion of the EVM account model**

Transaction conversion is done through the function createEthTX() of the QtumTxConverter class. The QtumTransaction type transaction is created using the parameters extracted in the previous step and the UTXO transaction output vout. Since QtumTransaction is derived from the dev::eth::Transaction class in EVM, the QtumTransaction class is supported by operations related to EVM execution.

&amp;nbsp;

QtumTransaction txEth;

If ( etp.receiveAddress == dev::Address() ) {

    txEth = QtumTransaction(txBit.vout\[nOut\].nValue, etp.gasPrice, (etp.gasLimit \*

     Etp.gasPrice),

     Etp.code, dev::u256(0));

}

Else{

    txEth = QtumTransaction(txBit.vout\[nOut\].nValue, etp.gasPrice, (etp.gasLimit \*

    Etp.gasPrice),

     etp.receiveAddress, etp.code, dev::u256(0));

}

Dev::Address sender(GetSenderAddress(txBit, view));

txEth.forceSender(sender);

txEth.setHashWith(uintToh256(txBit.GetHash()));

txEth.setNVout(nOut);

&amp;nbsp;

First, the code etp.receiveAddress == dev::Address() determines whether the contract is not in the EVM state and needs to be newly created or the contract already included in the EVM state. The only difference is the contract address. Then, the QtumTransaction() constructor completes some of the transaction parameter constructs, the next statement extracts the sender of the transaction, and then sets the transaction HASH. A UTXO transaction supports multiple inputs and outputs. Qtum's AAL design takes this into account, so AAL supports a transaction output containing UTXO accounts and contract accounts. The last set nOut indicates that the nOut output of the transaction is sent to the smart contract. , so this output will trigger contract execution. In this way, the transaction conversion is completed according to the EVM account model.

&amp;nbsp;

**3. Contract execution and UTXO conversion of execution results**

The execution of the contract changes state (managed by the QtumState class's instantiated object globalState). For the contract state, Qtum follows the EVM definition, so it is compatible with all EVM-compliant smart contracts. But the transfer of the account amount, Qtum made a UTXO conversion, which means that the smart contract and the ordinary UTXO model account can complete the interaction, which is an important part of AAL to achieve UTXO support smart contract. The following is a brief introduction to the conversion process of contract execution and status results.

&amp;nbsp;

**3.1 Contract execution environment construction and contract execution**

The execution of the contract is a critical step in the processing of the contract, directly affecting the state of the contract. The implementation of the EVM to the contract bytecode is implemented by the ByteCodeExec class. The main function is performByteCode(). The main process of this step is to use the transaction parameters extracted above to build the virtual machine execution environment, and then complete the execution of the contract, the code is as follows:

&amp;nbsp;

For(QtumTransaction&amp; tx : txs){

    Dev::eth::EnvInfo envInfo(BuildEVMEnvironment());

    Std::unique\_ptr&lt;dev::eth::SealEngineFace&gt;

   Se(dev::eth::ChainParams(dev::eth::genesisInfo(dev::eth::Network::HomesteadTest)).

    createSealEngine());

    If(!tx.isCreation() &amp;&amp; !globalState-&gt;addressInUse(tx.receiveAddress())){

        Dev::eth::ExecutionResult execRes;

        execRes.excepted = dev::eth::TransactionException::Unknown;

        Result.push\_back(ResultExecute{execRes, dev::eth::TransactionReceipt(dev::h256(),

        Dev::u256(), dev::eth::LogEntries()), CTransaction()});

        Continue;

    }

    Result.push\_back(globalState-&gt;execute(envInfo, \*se.get(), tx, type, OnOpFunc()));

}

&amp;nbsp;

The first is to build a contract execution environment, which is done by BuildEVMEnvironment(). It can be seen that this execution environment is carried out for each independent transaction, so as to minimize the contract execution process of different transactions and avoid the cross-effects in the contract execution process. Then build a new sealEngine class, which is the EVM execution engine, which is done by the createSealEngine() function. In the middle, the possible state exceptions that occur are checked, and then globalState-&gt;execute() completes the execution of the contract. Here, the execution environment envInfo and the EVM execution engine se are used.

&amp;nbsp;

**3.2 UTXO conversion of contract execution results**

After the completion of the contract execution, the result is stored in vector&lt;ResultExecute&gt; result. The vector vector records the transfer relationship between EVM accounts generated by each contract execution. AAL completes the transfer from EVM account model to UTXO model by converting these transfers into UTXO transactions. Conversion of the transaction. This processing is implemented by the processingResults() function. The following is a code snippet.

&amp;nbsp;

ByteCodeExecResult resultBCE;

For(size\_t i = 0; i &lt; result.size(); i++){

    If(result\[i\].execRes.excepted != dev::eth::TransactionException::None){

      If(txs\[i\].value() &gt; 0){

            CMutableTransaction tx;

            Tx.vin.push\_back(CTxIn(h256Touint(txs\[i\].getHashWith()), txs\[i\].getNVout(), CScript() &lt;&lt;

            OP\_SPEND));

            CScript script(CScript() &lt;&lt; OP\_DUP &lt;&lt; OP\_HASH160 &lt;&lt; txs\[i\].sender().asBytes() &lt;&lt;

            OP\_EQUALVERIFY &lt;&lt; OP\_CHECKSIG);

            Tx.vout.push\_back(CTxOut(CAmount(txs\[i\].value()), script));

            resultBCE.valueTransfers.push\_back(CTransaction(tx));

        }

    } else {

        resultBCE.usedFee += CAmount(result\[i\].execRes.gasUsed);

        CAmount ref((txs\[i\].gas() - result\[i\].execRes.gasUsed) \* txs\[i\].gasPrice());

        If(ref &gt; 0){

            CScript script(CScript() &lt;&lt; OP\_DUP &lt;&lt; OP\_HASH160 &lt;&lt; txs\[i\].sender().asBytes() &lt;&lt;

            OP\_EQUALVERIFY &lt;&lt; OP\_CHECKSIG);

            resultBCE.refundOutputs.push\_back(CTxOut(ref, script));

            resultBCE.refundSender += ref;

        }

    } if(result\[i\].tx != CTransaction()){

        resultBCE.valueTransfers.push\_back(result\[i\].tx);

    }}

&amp;nbsp;

First, the resultBCE variable of type ByteCodeExecResult is defined to save the result of the conversion. Use the opcode OP\_SPEND to implement the transaction cost, because the UTXO of Bitcoin uses the private key signature to realize the balance after the transaction input is unlocked, and the EVM implementation involves the transfer between different accounts, so these need to be implemented by OP\_SPEND Transfer to UTXO model trading conversion. If execRes.excepted is not None, ie the contract execution exception, the balance is returned to the contract caller. Otherwise, if there is no abnormality, the remaining gas after deducting the consumed gas is returned to the caller of the contract. For the transfer that occurs during contract execution, its UTXO transaction is stored in result\[i\].tx. Therefore, transactions between different UTXO accounts generated by this process of contract execution are stored in the valueTransfers vector, and eventually these transactions are included in the new block. At this point, the AAL module completes the conversion from EVM transactions to UTXO.

&amp;nbsp;

**4. Summary**

AAL assists in the creation, execution, and cost of contracts through the addition of UTXO script opcodes. Before the contract is created and executed, the conversion of the UTXO transaction to the EVM model transaction is required, and then the executed EVM execution environment and engine are used to complete the execution of the contract. AAL finally processed the results of the contract and adapted it from EVM to UTXO, thus implementing a UTXO-based smart contract. AAL makes Qtum compatible with EVM-compliant smart contracts, providing Dapp with a new base platform, while UTXO's advantages allow for advantages such as parallel processing and privacy.

https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/JdJLxEIBjD255qey6ITO_g

Qtum's core program, qtumd, runs all core logic including validation and creation of blocks. However, to achieve interaction with qtumd, you need to rely on RPC (Remote Procedure Call). Through RPC, you can interact with qtumd from the outside to implement basic functions such as sending and receiving QTUM and obtaining blockchain information.

The initial version of the Qtum RPC call is compatible with Bitcoin. On this basis, because the Qtum blockchain is different from Bitcoin, and Qtum supports the smart contract function that Bitcoin does not have, it is necessary to add a new RPC or improve the existing RPC to achieve Qtum. Full interaction of nodes.

The following section captures the relevant original design documents (with Chinese translation) for the Qtum RPC call from the early Qtum development team (ps: QTUM&lt;#&gt; or QTUMCORE&lt;#&gt; in the document is the internal design document number):

&amp;nbsp;

**QTUM-35: Add RPC call for off-chain contract execution**

**Description:** In Ethereum there are some contract's that can be executed without needing to be on the blockchain. This is useful especially for retrieving the status and results from a contract, and will make no changes to the on-chain storage or state. We should Add an RPC call to cover this functionality

&amp;nbsp;

    Callcontract \[address\] \[data\]

Returns/prints hex encoded return data

&amp;nbsp;

**Task:** Add an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) call to run under the chain Description: It is useful to have some contracts in Ethereum that are not working on the blockchain, especially when retrieving the status and results of contracts, and not changing the storage and status of the chain. We should add an RPC call to implement this functionality.     Callcontract \[address\] \[data\] Return / print hexadecimal encoded return data

&amp;nbsp;

**QTUMCORE-14: Add ""callcontract"" RPC call for off-chain computations**

**Description:** There should be an RPC call that executes a contract without requiring interaction with the blockchain network, and thus without gas or other fees. Callcontract contract-address data (sender) This should execute the contract locally, and if the contract function returns data, it should be returned/printed by the RPC call. Sender is optional and does not require an owned vout (it can be any valid address)

**Task:** Add a ""callcontract"" RPC call for the calculation of the chain Description: There should be an RPC call that does not require interaction with the blockchain network to run the contract, so it does not require gas or other fees. The format is as follows: Callcontract contract-address data (sender) It can run the contract locally, and if the contract function returns data, the RPC call can return/print the data. The sender is optional and does not need to have vout (it can be any valid address).

*The above two tasks add a callcontract RPC call interface to implement a local chain call contract, which is convenient for viewing contract status or obtaining contract results without changing any information on the chain.*

&amp;nbsp;

**QTUMCORE-7: Add ""createcontract"" RPC call**

&amp;nbsp;

**Description:** A new RPC call should be added call ""deploycontract"" ""createcontract"". This RPC call will be used to deploy a new smart contract to the Qtum blockchain.

Syntax:

Deploycontract createcontract gas-price gas-limit bytecode \[sender-address\] \[txfee\] \[broadcast\]

If no address is specified, then it should be picked randomly from the wallet. If no outputs exist to spend using that sender-address, then an error should be shown and no transaction created.

Tsfee is optional and if not specified should use the same auto txfee as the rest of the wallet (for example sendtoaddress uses an auto txfee)

Broadcast should default to true. If broadcast is false, then the transaction is created and signed, and then printed to the screen in hex rather than broadcast to the network.

If the sender-address does have an output, but it is not enough to cover the gas costs and tx fees, then any UTXO owned by the wallet should be used by the transaction to cover those fees. (not all funds must come from sender -address, but the sender-address must be vin\[0\])

After execution, if broadcast is true, it should print the txid and the new contract address.

**Task:** Add ""createcontract"" RPC call

**Description:** Add a ""createcontract"" RPC call that will be used to deploy a new smart contract on the Qtum blockchain.

grammar:

Createcontract gas-price gas-limit bytecode \[sender-address\] \[txfee\] \[broadcast\]

Among them, sender-address (sender address) is optional. If no address is specified, an address will be randomly selected from the wallet. If there is no output available in the sender-address, an error will be displayed and the transaction will not be created.

Txfee (transaction fee) is optional. If not specified, it should use the same automatic txfee as the rest of the wallet (for example, the automatic txfee used by sendtoaddress)

Broadcast should be true by default. If broadcast is false, the transaction is created and signed, and will be printed to the screen in hexadecimal format instead of being broadcast to the network.

If the sender-address does have an output, but it does not cover the gas charges and transaction fees, then any UTXO owned by the wallet can be used by the transaction to pay for these charges. (Not all funds must come from sender-address, but sender-address must be vin\[0\])

After running, if broadcast is true, the transaction id and the new contract address are printed.

The above task adds the RPC call createcontract for creating and deploying new smart contracts, and describes the specific meaning of the parameters and their corresponding behavior.

&amp;nbsp;

**QTUMCORE-13: Add ""sendtocontract"" RPC call**

**Description:** An rpc call should be adding for sending data and (optionally) money to a contract that has been deployed on the blockchain.

The format should be:

Sendtocontract contract-address data (value gaslimit gasprice sender broadcast)

This should create a contract call transaction using OP\_CALL.

Value defaults to 0.

If no address is specified, then it should be picked randomly from the wallet. If no outputs exist to spend using that sender-address, then an error should be shown and no transaction created.

Broadcast should default to true. If broadcast is false, then the transaction is created and signed, and then printed to the screen in hex rather than broadcast to the network.

If the sender-address does have an output, but it is not enough to cover the gas costs, tx fees, and value, then any UTXO owned by the wallet should be used by the transaction to cover the remainder. (not all funds must Come from sender-address, but the sender-address must be vin\[0\])

After execution, if broadcast is true, it should print the txid and the new contract address.

**Task:** Add ""sendtocontract"" RPC call

**Description:** In order to send data or funds to a contract already deployed on the blockchain, an RPC call should be added.

The format should be:

Sendtocontract contract-address data (value gaslimit gasprice sender broadcast)

You can use OP\_CALL to create a contract call transaction.

Value defaults to 0.

The sender-address is optional. If no address is specified, an address will be randomly selected from the wallet. If there are no outputs available in the sender-address, an error will be displayed and no transaction will be created.

Broadcast is default to true. If broadcast is false, then the transaction is created and signed and then printed to the screen in hexadecimal format instead of being broadcast to the network.

If the sender-address does have an output, but the output is not sufficient to cover the gas fee, transaction cost, and value, then any UTXO owned by the wallet can be traded to pay the remaining fee. (Not all funds must come from sender-address, but sender-address must be vin\[0\])

After running, if broadcast is true, the transaction id and the new contract address should be printed.

In order to implement the contract on the chain, the above task adds a sendtocontract RPC call. Its functionality is similar to callcontract and can be used to run contracts. The biggest difference is that sendtocontract implements the chain call, which requires the cost of the Gas, and the running result needs to be verified by the entire network node, and will change the storage state on the contract chain.

&amp;nbsp;

**QTUMCORE-81:create getTransactionReceipt rpc call**

**Description:** We need to create getTransactionReceipt rpc call that returns the same values ​​as here:

[https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#web3ethgettransactionreceipt](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#web3ethgettransactionreceipt)

Most important part is the logs. they can either be stored into a separate db or use one of the existing tx or eth related db.

**Task:** Create getTransactionReceipt RPC call

**Description:** We need to create a getTransactionReceipt RPC call that returns the same value as in the following link:

[https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#web3ethgettransactionreceipt](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#web3ethgettransactionreceipt)

The most important part is the log. They can be stored in a separate database, or they can use existing transactions or Ethereum-related databases.

*The above task adds a gettransactionreceipt RPC call to the smart contract log to get the contract transaction related logs, which is very useful for understanding the status of smart contracts.*

&amp;nbsp;

**QTUMCORE-90: add searchlogs rpc call**

**Description:** we need to add an rpc call to allow us to search the eth event logs, we need to support similar parameters as eth:

[https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#web3ethfilter](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#web3ethfilter)

So it would be: searchlogs(fromBlock, toBlock, address, topics)

fromBlock, toBlock should support latest keyword

Adderss: optional should be an array of one or more addresses

Topics: optional (check the link above)

Unlike eth where you have to call watch, this method should just output the filtered logs

**Task:** Add searchlogs RPC call

**Description:** We need to add a PRC call that allows searching for smart contract event logs, and we need to support parameters similar to Ethereum:

[https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#web3ethfilter](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#web3ethfilter)

So its form is as follows: searchlogs(fromBlock, toBlock, address, topics)

**fromBlock:** toBlock should support the latest keywords

**Address:** an optional array of one or more addresses

**Topics:** optional (refer to the link above)

Unlike the Ethereum, which needs to call watch, this method only outputs the filtered log.

The above task adds an RPC for retrieving the smart contract event log to facilitate screening of event logs that satisfy the condition. Users can quickly get the contract status they care about.

&amp;nbsp;

**QTUMCORE-92: add getcode and getstorageat rpc calls**

**Description:** We need to implement Qtum equivalent of these 2 rpc calls:

[https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#web3ethgetcode](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#web3ethgetcode)

[https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#web3ethgetstorageat](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#web3ethgetstorageat)

No need to implement callback function for now.

For the default block, we can use block number, or keyword ""latest"" (default)

**Task:** Add getcode and getstorageat RPC calls

**Description:** We need to implement the QTP version of the RPC call equivalent to the following two RPCs:

[https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#web3ethgetcode](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#web3ethgetcode)

[https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#web3ethgetstorageat](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#web3ethgetstorageat)

There is currently no need to implement a callback function.

For the default block, we can use the block number, or the keyword ""latest"" (default)

The above task implements an equivalent RPC similar to Ethereum for obtaining contract code and storing information.

&amp;nbsp;

**QTUMCORE-97: Change validation of contract rpc calls inputs**

**Description:** Change validation of contract rpc calls inputs to accept only hex

**Task:** Modify the verification of the input value of the contract RPC call

**Description:** Modify the validation of the input value of the contract RPC call to accept only hexadecimal.

*The above task stipulates that the RPC of the verification contract only accepts the hexadecimal data parameters, so that the rpc interface is as consistent as possible.*

&amp;nbsp;

**QTUMCORE-123: Add ""excepted"": to gettransactionreceipt**

**Description:** We need to add the ""excepted"": field to gettransactionreceipt rpc call which lists ""None"" if no exception occured, or lists the actual exception that happened.

The same lessons is in callcontract call.

We need the change to be backward compatible, which means it should not break the current logs db, but people who want to see exceptions would have to recreate/reindex the logs db

**Task:** Add ""excepted"": field in gettransactionreceipt

**Description:** We need to add the ""excepted"": field to the gettransactionreceipt RPC call. If no exception occurs, it will display ""None"", otherwise it will list the actual exception.

The same is true for Callcontract calls.

We need to modify it to be forward compatible, which means it can't break the current log database, but if you want to see these exceptions, you must rebuild/reindex the log database.

*The above tasks enable a number of RPCs associated with smart contracts to throw exceptions that are convenient for the user to understand the wrong running state of the contract and also help developers debug the code.*

&amp;nbsp;

**QTUMCORE-124:Add ""changeToSender"" to sendtoaddress and make sure the ""Don't use change address"" option also affects sendtoaddress**

**Description:** We need to add ""changeToSender"" parameter to sendtoaddress rpc call, same as we did for sendtocontract.

Also we need to make sure the ""Don't use change address"" also affects sendtoaddress

**Task:** Add ""changeToSender"" to sendtoaddress and make sure the ""Don't use change address"" option is also valid for sendtoaddress

**Description:** We need to add the ""changeToSender"" parameter to the sendtoaddress RPC call, which is also added to the sendtocontract.

We also need to make sure that the ""Don't use change address"" option is also valid for sendtoaddress.

Due to the UTXO model, the change of the contract call is easy to confuse the user. Therefore, the above task adds the option of ""do not use the change address"" for the sendtoaddressRPC, from which the user can choose to return to the original address.

&amp;nbsp;

**QTUMCORE-125: Add callcontract support to ""createrawtransaction"" rpc call**

**Description:** As requested by some exchanges, which use ""createrawtransaction"" to create raw transactions before signing on a cold wallet, we need to add

1- raw contract data support to ""createrawtransaction"" rpc call.

Currently ""createrawtransaction"" supports two types of outputs in the outputs arguments:

First is ""address"": [x.xxx](https://x.xxx) which created a standard P2PKH output

The second is ""data"": ""hex"" which creates an OP\_RETURN output

**We need to add:**

1- ""callcontract"":

{contractAddress:""address"", data:""data"", amount:""amount"", gasLimit:""gaslimit"", gasPrice:""gasPrice""}

Where:

**contractAddress:** a valid contract address (valid hash160 hex data)

**Data:** the hex data to add in the OP\_CALL output (should validate it's hex data, you can check the validation done in sendtocontract)

**Amount (optional):** the value of the output (value in QTUM to send with the call), should be a valid amount, default 0

**gasLimit (optional):** the gas limit for the transaction (same as in sendtocontract), defaults to the default/DGP value

**GasPrice (optional):** the gas price for the transaction (same as in sendtocontract), defaults to the default/DGP value

After parsing and validation all the values ​​an OP\_CALL output should be constructed

Similar to this:

CScript scriptPubKey = CScript() &lt;&lt; CScriptNum(VersionVM::GetEVMDefault().toRaw()) &lt;&lt; CScriptNum(nGasLimit) &lt;&lt; CScriptNum(nGasPrice) &lt;&lt; ParseHex(datahex) &lt;&lt; ParseHex(contractaddress) &lt;&lt; OP\_CALL;

**Task:** Make the ""createrawtransaction"" RPC call support callcontract

**Description:** Before some transactions are signed on the cold wallet, use ""createrawtransaction"" to create the original transaction. At the request of these exchanges, we should add:

1 -- original contract data support for ""createrawtransaction"" RPC calls

Currently, for the outputs parameter, ""createrawtransaction"" supports two types of outputs:

The first type is ""address"": [x.xxx](https://x.xxx), which creates a standard P2PKH output

The second type is ""data"": ""hexadecimal"", creating an OP\_RETURN output

**We need to add:**

1 -- ""callcontract"":

{contractAddress:""address"", data:""data"", amount:""amount"", gasLimit:""gaslimit"", gasPrice:""gasPrice""}

among them,

**contractAddress:** a valid contract address (valid hash 160 hex data)

**Data:** hexadecimal data added in OP\_CALL output (should be verified as hexadecimal data, you can check if it is verified in sendtocontract)

**Amount (optional):** The value of output (the value in QTUM, sent with this call), should be a valid value, the default is 0

**gasLimit (optional):** the gas limit of the transaction (same as sendtocontract), the default is the default/DGP value

**gasPrice (optional):** the gas price of the transaction (same as sendtocontract), defaults to the default/DGP value

After parsing and verifying all the values, you should build an OP\_CALL output.

The build method is similar to the following:

CScript scriptPubKey = CScript() &lt;&lt; CScriptNum(VersionVM::GetEVMDefault().toRaw()) &lt;&lt; CScriptNum(nGasLimit) &lt;&lt; CScriptNum(nGasPrice) &lt;&lt; ParseHex(datahex) &lt;&lt; ParseHex(contractaddress) &lt;&lt; OP\_CALL;

Prior to the above task, the createrawtransaction RPC call was consistent with Bitcoin and could only be used to send standard transactions. Qtum extends it to compatible contract transactions. From then on, the RPC can be used to create original contract transactions for developers or exchanges.

**Summary**

The RPC call is the most important way to interact with the qtumd core program. It provides a call interface for getting all kinds of information on the blockchain and local. It is the basis for many applications such as wallets, browsers, and exchanges. A good RPC interface design enables developers to get more accurate information and develop more feature-rich applications. Qtum provides developers with sophisticated RPC calls, making it possible for many third-party applications, such as predicting market projects, Bodhi.",NA,"8w122x",NA,0,NA,"false",1536481452,"false","self","t5_3ilam","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/Qtum/comments/8w122x/qtum_quantum_chain_design_document_add_rpc_calls/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

Although in its infancy, Solidity has had widespread adoption and is used to compile the byte-code in many Ethereum smart contracts we see today. There have been a number of harsh lessons learnt by developers and users alike in discovering the nuances of the language and the EVM. This post aims to be a relatively in-depth and up-to-date introductory post detailing the past mistakes that have been made by Solidity developers in an effort to prevent future devs from repeating history.

My recommendations for those that are paranoid about security:

* Don't allow any external connections into your pi. This means no SSH, no Qtum node access into your pi, etc.

* The only way you should be able to do any kind of maintenance on your pi, is to physically be at it and typing into the keyboard

* Encrypt the SD card you're using

* (super paranoid) setup an external node with no coins. Make it so that the only allowed connection from your raspberry pi is to connect to this node. This way an attack would have to compromise both your pi, and the external node to get any access

* (super paranoid) learn how to setup SELinux so that even with physical access to the pi, it is non-trivial to access the keys and such that are in memory within qtumd.

* Keep your raspberry pi physically out of sight, and don't have any markings on it explaining what it is.

* (super super paranoid) setup an anti-tampering system so that if the case to your pi is opened it clears memory and turns itself off.

* Always keep several encrypted backups of your private keys in multiple locations.

* Turn off ALL bash history logging. This can result in your wallet password being stored in plaintext

* Never use an external computer to open or generate your Pi wallet. This compromises the security benefits of the Pi in case your external computer gets a virus. If you must open your wallet on an external computer, generate a completely new wallet on the Pi and do not use the old wallet in the future.

* Don't store your encrypted wallet anywhere that it can be accessed from the internet. Using thumb drive or paper copies is fine, but don't store an encrypted wallet.dat in dropbox, for example.

* If you want to be able to track your balance of tokens and rate of staking, then use only a single address on the Pi and bookmark that address on a block explorer. This way you do not need to access the Pi to check if it is staking as expected.

On August 2, 2018, Vancouver, Canada, the Etherparty Smart Contracts (Etherparty), a blockchain technology company based in Canada, officially announced that it will work with Qtum to explore and research technology.

&amp;nbsp;

In the future, the core technology of the Qtum Chain will work together with Etherparty ""Rocket"", which will be easily created based on the Token in the Qtum Smart Contract. Even if the white user does not need to know any code, the safe and robust core underlying network based on the Qtum quantum chain can get the corresponding benefits.

&amp;nbsp;

""For Etherparty to join the Qtum Quantum Chain, it is a great opportunity to work together on the large-scale application of smart contracts,"" said Etherparty founder and CEO Lisa Cheng.

&amp;nbsp;

The Qtum blockchain uses a POS consensus mechanism that allows all peer-to-peer network nodes to enjoy equal rights and lower the barriers to entry into the blockchain domain. In addition, Qtum's innovative Distributed Autonomy Protocol (DGP) enables dynamic adjustment of blockchain basic parameters without the need for hard forks.

&amp;nbsp;

Etherparty has just released its first software product, named ""Rocket"", which will be the most influential one of Etherparty's first products.

&amp;nbsp;

""Rocket"" is a high-use Token crowdfunding platform designed for blockchain enterprise users. Following the principle of steady development, ""Rocket"" can provide users with a series of services such as global Token publishing and tracking.

&amp;nbsp;

Etherparty reduces the barriers to corporate use and everyday use of smart contract solutions. Writing smart contracts can be complex, time consuming, and costly. Looking at Etherparty's suite of smart contract products, the common feature is ease of use. We are a world that is open to the world. Making smart contracts and blockchain technology no longer out of reach for ordinary Internet users.",NA,"946ddu",NA,0,NA,"false",1536702130,"false","self","t5_3ilam","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/Qtum/comments/946ddu/qtum_and_etherparty_work_together_to_discover_the/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

**On July 30th, the “Asia Silicon Valley” Cyberport Block Summit was successfully held in Hong Kong. Zhong Wenbin, the chief development engineer of Qtum Quantum Chain China, was invited to attend and delivered a keynote speech. In addition, he shared his own evolution of blockchain technology with the blockchain enthusiasts in the topic sharing, and the future blockchain technology in the new business era. Unique insights.**

&amp;nbsp;

At this summit, Zhong Wenbin first analyzed the historical evolution of blockchain technology: *""The birth of blockchain technology has its historical significance and historical inevitability, which essentially promotes peer-to-peer and peer-to-peer network transmission, and accelerates global Internet information. The transformation of the Internet to the value of the Internet. This transformation is revolutionary, meaning breaking the traditional centralized company structure that has existed for centuries , spreading the network weights to every node of the network, so that everyone has equal Power, which will fundamentally change the original values ​​of the public.""*

&amp;nbsp;

*“Bitcoin is the original and the most mature blockchain ecosystem so far, thanks to its safe and stable currency attributes. But the currency attribute is only one aspect. The limited expansion of Bitcoin's ecology is not enough to promote the area. The large-scale application of blockchain technology in people's daily life, in other words, there is no killer application in the blockchain field that can make everyone amazing. To achieve this goal and more blockchains For commercial applications, Qtum Quantum Chain takes these limitations into account when designing blockchain products, and combines Bitcoin's UTXO model with the flexibility of the Ethereum virtual machine, complemented by a self-innovated account abstraction layer. The problem that coins and Ethereum cannot interact with each other.""* Zhong Wenbin added.

&amp;nbsp;

Subsequent to the blockchain industry leaders group to share, in the face of some of the challenges facing future technological development, Zhong Wenbin said: *""The blockchain technology is still in its early stages, and many underlying infrastructure and value networks are still immature. Many developers in the industry are behind closed doors, which wastes a lot of time and effort on research and development. This is because it is difficult to reach a consensus between the blockchain community and the traditional community, and the problems to be solved are different"".*

&amp;nbsp;

As the Qtum Quantum Chain, the current major development focus is on the development of the Qtum x86 virtual machine and the QtumX Enterprise Edition. The former can change the limitations of Ethereum virtual machines that can only use Solidity to write and deploy smart contracts, creating a better development environment for a large number of blockchain developers , and bringing unlimited possibilities to the future Dapp market . The latter's development ideas are different, with a more performance-oriented POA consensus mechanism and better transaction processing capabilities to serve more enterprise-level applications . ”

&amp;nbsp;

**Cyberport**

&amp;nbsp;

The “Asian Silicon Valley” Cyberport Block Summit was hosted by Hong Kong Cyberport. The Qtum Quantum Chain co-organized and gathered the attention of more than 300 blockchain developers and technology enthusiasts in Hong Kong. It is the progress and ecology of blockchain technology in Hong Kong. Development has helped. The Cyberport is an innovative digital community with 1,000 digital technology companies managed by Hong Kong Cyberport Management Limited, a company wholly owned by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government. The vision of Cyberport is to help start-ups, promote the development of digital technology and work hard to create a new economic impetus for Hong Kong.",NA,"946jsr",NA,0,NA,"false",1536702214,"false","self","t5_3ilam","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/Qtum/comments/946jsr/qtum_asia_silicon_valley_cyberport_block_summit/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

I'm asking for some help here as it is more active then within the QTUM official forum.
Issue: I have the QTUM CORE wallet on my MAC desktop, that has worked fine, up until now. Every time i try to open it, it almost starts but then nothing happens! which is strange as it was working fine 2 months ago. 
The only thing i can think of is because I have changed laptops recently, however i carried all info across.  

I tried even downloading the latest QTUM desktop wallet (mac) from the site and that does the same thing! so far no luck.

- Could it be a certain security toggle | Bad download | any ideas.

Thanks in advance

TLDR: We’ve been direct marketing to developers and dev related sites, running global meetups and training sessions for content creators and interested developers - that has been our focus for the last 4 months. In addition, we have been promoting our hackathon.    Mainstream / new to crypto marketing will be pushed out in October – we wanted to make sure we had lots of projects and teams working on dapps so we can show folks that we’re not just a token but a blockchain with a diverse and interesting spectrum of Dapps developed or under development with our tech. 

We have been using our marketing dollars for specific goals. Our goal over the summer was to increase dev adoption of the network. Since we would like to see projects use our tech, we reached out and/or advertised to places where Devs are more likely to gather.  Or had them join telegram for direct chats if they couldn’t meet in person at our meetups. 

We also worked on promotions regarding the hackathon and prizes (which, has brought online a bunch of cool projects)
We promoted content to folks who have experience in smart contracts, we also been flying around the world – like literally, around the world. We had teams running demos and workshops in Korea, Japan, all over the US, a few in Mexico and South America, Paris, Moscow and a ton of other places.    We've sponsored local makerspaces and crypto user groups. We feel that a strong developer community is very important at this stage.  Oh, and we’ve also given out a ton of t-shirts!  We wanted to interact with folks who would be interfacing with our blockchain. We also wanted to speak with influencers and project managers.  We wanted to literally sit down and go here is how this works, here is how you can USE this network. 
 
We’ve been making sure the development community can get involved and get their answers in a timely fashion and bring their own dapps online. 

Advertising to “mainstream/new to crypto” folks also requires we ramp up our support.  In some cases, we end up handling support for exchanges too, since some folks just assume we’re involved in that process.  You guys may have noticed back earlier this year and the previous general marketing runs that the “how do I x” posts really pile up.  

We want potential Qtum holders to see we have a collection of Dapps working on us, validating our claims that our solution works! We want potential Qtum holders to see they are supporting much more than just a promise or a fancy whitepaper. Also, it helps now that we have a listing with kraken, and that circle FCC approved announcement is BIG news.  (Goldman Sachs backed SEC regulated cryptocurrency exchange project, has added 4 new tokens on its platform. They are EOS, Stellar[XLM], 0x[ZRX] and Qtum. With the addition of 4 more assets, a total of 11 assets can be now traded on Circle Invest.)

Quick edit: We read everyone's comments -  including those from the other thread. I'll post a follow-up near the start of Nov and we can talk about our marketing to new users and how that's looking.  Our expectation is that we'll see the difference pretty quickly on social media as new interest starts coming in.

(Google Translation from original r/https://docs.qtum.site/zh/Canal-Cross-Chain/)

**Background introduction**

With the development of blockchain technology, digital currency based on blockchain has also emerged. These digital currencies are distributed across different blockchain networks and cannot be directly interoperable, so transactions must be made with the help of digital currency exchanges. Traditional digital currency exchanges are mostly centralized services that are challenged in terms of security and privacy. Decentralized exchanges running on the chain are receiving more and more attention because of their data transparency, privacy protection, and real-time settlement.

Most of the proposed decentralized exchanges only implement token transactions on the same chain, and cannot realize cross-chain digital currency transactions, which limits the application scenarios of decentralized exchanges. This paper proposes a decentralized digital currency exchange solution that enables cross-chain digital currency transactions.

We call this solution a canal because the canal transports goods and transactions between multiple cities. The original intention of the scheme is that when users use their one-click chain function to release their own blockchain, they can use this solution to exchange digital currency with other chains, thus facilitating the circulation of digital currency.

**Related technology**

**Decentralized exchange**

The decentralized exchanges currently proposed can be divided into the following two categories.

**Pending order**

Decentralized exchange systems, including 0x \[1\] and Kyber Network \[2\], are all types of pending order transactions. Users post their own buy or sell orders through smart contracts, and the system helps find the most appropriate combination of buy and sell orders for trading. This decentralized exchange can be seen as transplanting the transaction process of the original centralized exchange to the chain, and the transaction process mechanism has not changed.

The advantages of this trading method are as follows:

1. Transparent transaction: the pending order data is completely open, and the price is not easy to be manipulated;

2. Capital security: Digital currency is managed through smart contracts, and is transferred to the user's account in time after the transaction is completed;

3. Low transaction costs: There are no third-party fees other than transaction fees.

The disadvantages are as follows:

1. Queued transactions, queued in chronological order to complete the transaction, and the transaction speed is slow;

2. When the trading market is not active and it is difficult to reach the agreement between the buyer and the seller, it is easy to cause the market to have no transactions, that is, the market liquidity becomes weak.

**Automatic pricing**

Bancor Network \[3\] realized automatic pricing transactions between users and digital currency funds pools through smart contracts. The trading process is as follows:

1. The project party builds a trading contract and deposits a certain amount of digital currency A and B into the contract as the initial pool of funds, and then the user can realize the automatic pricing transaction between A and B through the contract.

2. When the user needs to exchange the A currency for the B currency, the A currency is first deposited into the contract, and then the system calculates the conversion rate of A to B according to the stock of the A and B coins in the current contract, and the corresponding amount in the fund pool. The B currency is transferred to the user account, and the A currency deposited by the user is put into the fund pool.

3. If the user continuously exchanges the A currency for the B currency, the A currency in the fund pool increases, and the B currency decreases, so that the conversion rate is lowered, that is, the B currency that the A currency can exchange for is reduced.

The advantages of automated pricing transactions are as follows:

1. Solve the problem of token liquidity. The project party does not have to pay a huge amount of currency, and the token can be circulated in a stable and secure system.

2. Users do not need to place a pending order, they can trade at any time, and there is no opponent disk.

3. There is no problem with the depth of the order, and the user does not have to worry about the problem that his transaction cannot be fully realized due to insufficient depth.

The disadvantages are as follows:

1. The project party is required to pledge a portion of the currency in advance to the system.

2. Currently only supports digital currency conversion on the same chain

**Cross-chain technology**

The data between the blockchain networks cannot be interworked, which greatly limits the application space of the blockchain. Cross-chain technology aims to solve this problem and achieve data transfer between blockchains. At present, the cross-chain technology on the market only realizes the exchange of values ​​on different blockchains, but does not realize the transaction function; that is, the digital currency can only be converted according to the pre-agreed conversion rate, and cannot change the price with the market dynamics. This has hindered the free flow of digital currency value to a certain extent, and also limited the application space of cross-chain technology.

Cross-chain technology can be divided into two categories.

**Relay transmission**

One type of cross-chain technology uses a main chain to connect each side chain to achieve data intercommunication between side chains. This main chain is usually called Hub or Relay. For example, Cosmos \[4\], Polkadot \[5\], etc., the basic idea is basically the same:

1. The main chain adopts a weakly centralized consensus algorithm such as dPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) and PoA (Proof of Authority), that is, the output of the block is completed by a few super nodes, or may be called a coalition chain.

2. The super node of the main chain monitors the data changes of the side chain, and then generates corresponding data in the main chain; or monitors the change of the main chain data, and generates corresponding data in the side chain. Thereby, the interworking of the main chain and the side chain data is realized.

The advantage of this cross-chain mode is that data transmission is fast and efficient, and can transmit any form of data in the chain; the disadvantage is that it brings centralization, that is, the accuracy of cross-chain data depends on the super node of the alliance chain.

**Atomic exchange**

Atomic cross-chain exchange \[6\] is a script that uses blockchains to implement atomic exchange of digital currencies in two blockchain networks. The atom here means that the two transactions issued by the exchange parties on the two blockchain systems must be completed simultaneously or simultaneously. The specific steps are as follows:

1. Alice exchanges the B currency owned by Bob with her own A currency.

2. Alice creates the transaction and pays the A currency to an output script that needs to be unlocked with a key that Alice knows and Bob's signature.

3. After Bob sees the transaction created by Alice, he also creates a transaction and pays the B currency to an output script that requires the same key and Alice's signature to unlock.

4. Alice unlocks the transaction created by Bob with the key and signature, transfers the B currency to its own account address, and the key is chained with the transfer operation.

5. After Bob sees the key on the chain, he uses the key and his signature to unlock the transaction created by Alice, and transfers the A currency to her account address, and the exchange is complete.

6. If Alice and Bob terminate the operation in the process, the two transactions will be returned to Alice and Bob after a certain period of time, and the exchange fails.

The advantage of this cross-chain mode is complete decentralization, and the exchange does not depend on any third party; the disadvantage is that an exchange process must rely on 4 transactions to complete, the speed is slow and inefficient, and the transmitted data can only be the generation on the chain. Currency data.

**Algorithm introduction**

This paper presents a decentralized cross-chain digital currency exchange solution. The trading process is completed by a coalition chain network and multiple smart contracts. Take such a scenario as an example: the digital currency on sidechain A needs to be replaced with the digital currency on sidechain B. We complete the transaction through the main chain as a relay.                    

**Main chain**

The main chain uses a coalition chain. The super nodes of the alliance chain are voted through all users of the exchange. One possible solution is that each time a user converts a digital currency, they can vote for an address. All votes are counted in a certain period of time, so that the address with the highest number of votes is selected as the super node. The advantage of this is that the blockchain governance authority is in the hands of users who frequently trade digital currency. These users can vote for the super nodes they identify with, and the super nodes represent the rights of these users.

The SuperNode is responsible for verifying all transactions on the blockchain and generating new blocks. The main chain connects all the side chains that need to be traded, thus ensuring that data can be transmitted across the chain. At the same time, the main chain is responsible for running the smart contracts required for digital currency trading. A specific implementation will be described below.

**Cross-chain**

The cross-chain part adopts the relay mode, which consists of two contracts, one is deployed on the main chain, called the main contract, and the other is deployed on the side chain, called sub-contract. The sub-contract is used for the user to charge and withdraw coins on the side chain, which is consistent with the concept of the coin in the centralized exchange. The main contract is used to synchronize the user's charge and transaction records, and store the user's balance.

The cross-chain steps are as follows:

1. Coin

i. The user deposits the digital currency A to be redeemed into the address of the sub-contract on the side chain A, and may deposit the digital currency of the chain itself, or may be the ERC20 token.

ii. The super node listens to the change in the number of digital currency A under the sub-contract address on the side chain A. After a certain number of blocks on the side chain A is confirmed, the corresponding number of generations is added to the user's address in the main contract of the chain A. currency.

2. transaction

i. The user operation deposits the token under the own address in the main contract 1 into the address of the transaction contract.

ii. The trading contract transfers the converted digital currency B to the user address of the main contract B.

3. Coin

i. The user initiates a coin request to the sub-contract of side chain B.

ii. The super node listens to the coin request on the side chain B, and then detects whether there is a corresponding amount of tokens under the user address on the main contract B in the main chain; if sufficient tokens are detected, the deduction is performed, and then in the side chain B transfers the corresponding number of digital currency B to the user address.

T**ransaction**

The transaction uses an automatic pricing model consisting of a smart contract. When the contract is initialized, it needs to be filled with a certain number of digital currencies A and B as a pool of funds to realize the transaction between A and B. This part of the funds achieve dynamic conversion and balance in the user's continuous trading process.

The transaction process is as follows:

1. The user wants to convert a certain number of digital currency A into digital currency B.

2. The system calculates the number of Bs that can be converted according to the number of As to be converted and the stocks of A and B in the current fund pool.

3. The user confirms the number of Bs that can be converted.

4. The user will need to convert the digital currency A to the contract address and enter the funds pool.

5. The system transfers the transferred B to the user's fund pool to the user's address to complete the conversion transaction.

The conversion calculation in step 2 needs to follow the following principles:

1. The less A in the fund pool, the higher the conversion rate of A to B, the more A, the lower the conversion rate, and B is also the same.

2. You cannot use up any of the digital currencies in the pool, otherwise you will not be able to continue the conversion.

Based on the above principles, the computational logic of the transformation can be of various designs, and a relatively simple formula is given here.

1. Assume that the stocks of the digital currencies A and B in the fund pool are a0 and b0 respectively (a0 &gt; 0, b0 &gt; 0), and the user wants to convert the digital currency A of Δa (Δa &gt; 0) to obtain Δb (△). b &gt; 0) of the digital currency B.

2. The number of Bs that can be converted to is: Δb = ( b0 \* Δa ) / (a0 + Δa).

3. It can be seen that Δb is an increasing function of b0 and is a decreasing function of a0, which is in accordance with principle 1.

4. It can be seen that △b &lt; b0, the B in the pool will not be exhausted, in line with principle 2.

T**o Sum Up**

In the process of design, we have two thoughts. First, we feel that we should not over-emphasize decentralization and sacrifice the efficiency of the transaction; because in the actual use of the system, if the transaction is too slow, it will affect the user experience; and the decentralization needs in an alliance. In the chain system, voting for trusted super nodes can also be satisfied to some extent. Second, the mode of automatic pricing transactions should be significantly better than pending orders in actual use, because many new digital currency trading volume liquidity cannot be guaranteed, and the automatic pricing trading model solves the liquidity well. The problem.

# SCAR: Scalable Consensus Algorithm -- A scalable consensus algorithm

# Background introduction

Traditional blockchain formula algorithms such as PoW (Proof of Work) and PoS (Proof of Stake) usually have intervals of more than 10 seconds in order to reduce the stability of the network. For example, Ethereum's block interval is 15 seconds, Qtum is 144 seconds, and Bitcoin is 10 minutes. Excessive block interval time leads to a longer waiting time for the user to confirm the transaction, which is not conducive to applications such as real-time payment.

Some consensus algorithms of the alliance chain, such as EOS's DPoS \[1\] (Delegated Proof of Stake), Parity's Aura \[2\] (Authority Round), etc., by voting for the super node to execute the consensus algorithm, the block interval can be The time dropped to within 1 second. But the problem with this is that the number of blocks is too large, which puts a lot of pressure on network bandwidth and data storage. Running a full node, or even a light node that only downloads the block header, has high requirements on the performance of the node device.

For most commercial applications of blockchains, such as credit tracking, commodity traceability, etc., writes to blockchains are usually periodic. That is to say, the trading volume is large in part of the day, and the trading volume is small in the remaining time. For such a scenario, if the high-speed block output is always maintained, it is a big waste for the network and storage resources, and only needs to ensure that the system has higher performance during the peak hours of the network.

Therefore, we propose the SCAR (Scalable Consensus Algorithm) scalable consensus algorithm. SCAR's idea is to dynamically adjust parameters based on the load of the blockchain network to find a balance between high performance and low load to achieve performance scalability.

# Introduction to related consensus algorithms

PoW, represented by Bitcoin. The node provides computational power to generate new blocks through a large number of calculations. The higher the power, the faster the block is generated. The calculation difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks, ensuring that the block time interval is kept at around 10 minutes in the case of a change in the overall network computing power. Since the block interval is long and the size of each block is limited to 1 MB, when the transaction volume is large, the network will be seriously congested.

PoS, represented by Qtum. The node provides a token and generates a new block with a small amount of calculation. The larger the token amount, the faster the block is generated. The calculation difficulty will also be adjusted periodically to ensure that the block time interval is around 144 seconds. Compared with PoW, PoS reduces the computational power requirements and saves energy. However, since the block interval and the block size limit are still fixed, the load on the network is fixed, and it is impossible to avoid congestion when the transaction volume is large. Although Qtum can now manually adjust the block size limit using the DGP \[3\] (Decentralized Governance Protocol) protocol, this approach is slightly cumbersome.

In PoW and PoS, all nodes of the whole network will participate in the consensus competition, so the block interval cannot be set too small. If it is too small, it is easy to produce a fork. That is, if the calculation difficulty is set too low, it is easy for a plurality of nodes to generate a new block at the same time.

The alliance chain consensus algorithm such as DPoS and Tendermint performs consensus by voting the super nodes. Since the number of nodes participating in the consensus is small, the block interval can be set small. For example, the EOS block interval is set to 0.5s. Too short a block interval is a great pressure on bandwidth and hard disk, and it is also a waste of resources when the transaction volume is small. Since the launch of EOS on June 9 this year, the number of blocks has reached 12 million, and Bitcoin, which started 9 years ago, has only 500,000 blocks.

# SCAR consensus algorithm description

An implementation of the SCAR algorithm will be described below. Based on the alliance chain, this implementation dynamically updates the block interval by the transaction volume, thereby realizing the scalability of the blockchain performance. It should be noted that the core idea of ​​the SCAR algorithm is to dynamically adjust the performance of the blockchain according to the load, so the implementation is not limited to the one proposed in this paper, and more implementations need to be further explored.

The SCAR consensus algorithm consists of three steps:

&gt;Statistics vote for all super nodes.The block interval is calculated based on the network load.After the interval expires, the super node outputs blocks according to the priority. Once a new block is produced, return to step 1.

The advantages of the SCAR consensus algorithm are:

&gt;Consensus is implemented by the super node, the block interval can be greatly shortened, and the transaction confirmation is fast.The block interval is dynamically adjusted according to the network load. When idle, the interval becomes longer, reducing the bandwidth and hard disk pressure.When less than half of the super nodes fail, the new block can still be produced, and the system is robust.

The three steps of the SCAR algorithm will be described separately below.

## Node voting

There are many designs for voting for a supernode. For example, EOS is that all users can vote, Aura is the current super node can vote for the next round of super nodes. Here we propose a voting strategy based on the Qtum DGP protocol.

When the blockchain is initialized, DGP's smart contract is deployed on the chain, and the management seat admin and the governance seat gov are initialized in the contract, and are stored in the form of addresses. The DGP protocol supports voting on the chain by managing the seat admin and the governance seat gov to determine if the supernode changes.

First, we will introduce the permissions and modification strategies of the management seats and governance seats. The management seat admin has the most power to determine the authority. It can participate in voting to add and delete admins, and can vote for gov. gov can only participate in the modified voting of the super node. That is, all proposals can only be set by the admin address with the management seat. The gov address with the governance seat can only participate in the super node voting.

The specific process of voting is as follows:

&gt;Collect new super node proposals, publish and collect feedback to the community;Adjust the list of super nodes based on community feedback and store them in the blockchain through smart contracts as a new proposal;The proposal is set to the proposal to be voted by calling the corresponding method of the DGP contract, and the voting is started at this time;An address with administrative admin and governance gov permissions votes on the proposal by sending a transaction to the voting contract;If the proposal does not receive enough votes, it will be rejected and no amendments will be implemented;If the proposal passes, the storage address of the new supernode list will be recorded in the DGP contract and will take effect after a certain number of blocks to prevent unnecessary forks.Nodes can get the latest list of supernodes through DGP contracts.

In summary, we can set up a DGP contract on the chain, determine the super node by DGP voting, and dynamically store and update the list of authorized miners.

## Block interval

The interval of the block needs to be dynamically adjusted according to the load of the network. When the network is idle, the interval becomes longer. When the network is busy, the interval becomes shorter, thus achieving dynamic scalability. Here we propose a calculation method of block interval, which is calculated according to the number of recent transactions. When the transaction is more, the interval becomes shorter, and when the transaction is less, the interval becomes longer.

The formula for calculating the block interval is as follows:

https://i.redd.it/82e10qjk66k11.png

Among them, min\_interval is the minimum block time interval, and max\_interval is the maximum block time interval. Transaction\_num is the average number of transactions in the last m blocks, where m can be an integer greater than or equal to 1. m, min\_interval, and max\_interval are pre-set by consensus algorithms or smart contract settings.

The significance of this design formula is:

&gt;When the transaction amount transaction\_num is 0, the block interval will be adjusted to max\_interval. At this time, the longest interval set by the system will be used to pack more transactions in one block as much as possible, thereby avoiding waste of storage space;When the transaction volume transaction\_num tends to infinity, the block interval will infinitely approach min\_interval, and the shortest interval set by the system will be used to ease the transaction congestion of the blockchain network as much as possible, so that the transaction is packaged more quickly. BlockMax\_interval and min\_interval can be set according to the actual situation (such as user tolerated transaction delay, super node network environment and storage performance, etc.).

By using the consensus algorithm SCAR, which dynamically adjusts the block time of the block according to the network state, it can effectively avoid wasting storage space when the transaction volume is small, and can also increase the block generation rate when the transaction volume is large, and timely package the transaction into the area. On the blockchain, the transaction is guaranteed to be confirmed more quickly. The dynamic adjustment of the parameters on the chain also makes the blockchain system more flexible, improves governance efficiency, and reduces the difficulty and cost of governance.

## Block output

After the super node and block interval are determined, the node can take turns to generate a new block after the interval.

At a blockchain height, if the number of super nodes is n, SCAR will assign a different block time block\_time to each super node as follows:

https://i.redd.it/vtv8pnuy66k11.png

Where parent\_block\_time is the block time of the previous block and block\_interval is the dynamically calculated block interval. Timeout is the timeout period. It is used to prevent some super nodes from failing to be out of the block for a long time. The miner\_index is the index value. Under the same block height, different authorization nodes have different miner\_index. The specific reasons and uses of the parameter settings will be explained below.

As shown in the following figure, assume that there are 5 authorized super nodes A, B, C, D, E, their public key is stored in the ordered list, which is selected by the DGP vote mentioned above and can be dynamic Maintained list of supernodes (also known as miners). Assume that at the blockchain height h1, the ordered miners list is \[pubkey\_A, pubkey\_B, pubkey\_C, pubkey\_D, pubkey\_E\], and the five supernodes will create new chunks in turn.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/rubwtw5576k11.png

When a new block is created, the miners sign the block with an encryption algorithm and then append the signature result to the block. In this way, other nodes can recover the miner's public key from the block by decryption, thereby verifying whether the miner has the right to create a block by comparing with the super node list. When a chain is signed by most miners, the chain can be viewed as a permanent chain. For example, in the above image, the chain from the creation block to the height of h3 is a permanent chain because it has been signed by its next few miners D, E and A. If any miner wants to make a fork under height h3, this fork is not recognized by most miners.

The consensus algorithm can effectively avoid the occurrence of forks, but at least the n/2+1-bit super node needs to keep the formula algorithm running normally (n is the number of super nodes, n/2 is integer division). The consensus algorithm defines the miners who are allowed to create the next block:

A miner can create a new block in the following situations:

&gt;It is currently authorized;The last n/2 blocks were not created by it.

From the above definition, the way to actually create the super node of the next block can be obtained: the node signed for the nearest n/2 block can be removed from the current miner list. For example, at the block height h2, the list of miners in the next block is calculated as shown.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/te7ktj1776k11.png

After selecting the four nodes B, C, and D that can create the next block, we only need to set the super node list as an ordered list, and specify their priority order to avoid them. Coming out of the next block. The miner\_index in the formula is the priority index of the sorted miners list. The super-sorted super nodes will be assigned the earlier block\_time, and each super node will use the allocated block\_time to create a new block, before the block\_time arrives. Keep waiting.

However, the super-node mode of the alliance chain also faces a problem: the failure of some nodes will lead to a sudden drop in network efficiency. In order to avoid the failure of some nodes and cause the system to stop running, the consensus is to add the following strategy to ensure normal outbound. We set the timeout in the system parameters. If a super node fails to broadcast a new block due to a failure, the next super node will replace it after the timeout time and normally generate the block. As shown in the figure below, in the case of the above five super nodes, Miner B fails when producing a block with a height of h2+1. Subsequently, B's next C in the list of supernodes will broadcast the new block it created after the block\_interval+timeout time of its parent\_block\_time.

&amp;#x200B;

# to sum up

While ensuring the performance of the blockchain, SCAR saves bandwidth and hard disk consumption as much as possible, and supports dynamic adjustment of the parameters on the chain. It is more efficient and flexible than other consensus algorithms, and will be larger in large-scale commercial applications. The advantages.
