feeRecipient to Relayer’s desired recieving address and signs the order with their private key.

# Participation Common Problems/Questions and Solutions

**""Out of Gas Error""**  
Try to put the gas limit at 230K. 

**""Connecting to Blockchain Forever""** :  
This step might take 5-10 minutes. Please be patient.

**""I Got 99 Errors and I'm Tired of This Shit""** :  
You can send your ETH directly to the crowdsale address [here](https://etherscan.io/address/zrxsale.eth). DOUBLE CHECK THAT THE CONTRACT IS THE RIGHT ONE BEFORE SENDING, ALWAYS. 

**""Can I send more than 1 transaction?""**:  
Yes, as long as the sum of all your contribution is below the daily limit.

**""Metamask is unresponsive of always give me errors""**  
It seems like Metamask can't handle the current load and transaction that failed might be blocking subsequent transactions to be sent (nonce related problem). The best solution is to use another wallet. Here's the simplest way via MEW:   

* 1. Open Metamask  
* 2. Click on the triple dots   
* 3. Click on export privatekey  
* 4. Copy private key  
* 5. Open www.myetherwallet.com  
* 6. Click on **Send ETH &amp; Tokens**  
* 7. Click on import Private key  
* 8. Paste your private key (DO NOT PASTE IT ANYWHERE ELSE AND CLEAR YOUR CLIPBOARD AFTER)  
* 9. Unlock wallet (might ask for password)  
* 10. Specify the address to be zrxsale.eth  
* 11. Set gas limit to 250K  
* 12. Set GWei to whatever you are OK with (worked for me with 1Gwei and took about 10 mins)  
* 13. Generate transaction  
* 14. Send transaction  

If you get an error saying something like ""Couldn't connect to node, try refreshing ..."" Click on Network on the top right and select a new ETH node.

# MEW Shortlist of Solutions ( from /u/insomniasexx )

- Check Help Center: https://myetherwallet.groovehq.com/help_center

- You can edit gas price in the header as well. Drag slider up towards 60 if you need it to go through *now*

### But where did my tokens go?
We have temporarily disabled viewing all tokens by default **except ZRX** due to the servers being overloaded because people were using MEW to check token balances and somehow managed to check 4M balances in like 15 minutes which is nutty and expensive. 

If you need to check other token balances: you can add custom token or wait a few hours until we bring them back.

If you were having issues loading all balances: this should be resolved, or try a differnt network (etherscan / infura) via the dropdown in top-right corner

*   [The most up to date instructions on how to add a custom token can be found here.](https://myetherwallet.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/how-to-see-a-new-token-in-myetherwallet?from_search=true)
*   [The list of token addresses / decimals / symbols is here.](https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/ethereum-lists/blob/master/tokens-eth.json) They are in alpha-order.

### Ledger / HW / Mnemonic Issues

If you are interested in filling on of the trades, you just need to click on one of the URL above. The OTC will read the signed order (so you can verify if the signature matches the order, don't trust me.) You might need to wait a little for the OTC to connect on the main net via Metamask.

You will also need to go in balances and set some allowances so that the 0x contract knows which tokens you allow to trade (you don't want to give access to a faulty token for example).  

Happy Over the Counter Trading :)

But because of the way their UI works, unless your order is within the top 50 or so orders, it will show up NEITHER in the order book NOR in your Orders tab. I ended up selling 24900 of those tokens for less than 0.0005 later in the evening and used some of the proceeds to max out my daily quota. 

I then put in deposit into Etherdelta of the newly acquired tokens (+ the 7000 or so I had from before) and then went to sleep. Turns out that since 100 tokens remained from my old 25k sell order at 0.005, the order stayed open! And the newly added 14.4k also went into it and got sold. I then proceeded to miss the buying window on day 2 (since 200 gwei was apparently not enough).

I am relatively new to cryptos, have been reading a lot the last 2 months and invested some fiat. Now while I have participated in ICOs before, this is the first time I put a higher amount (around 4 ETH) into an ICO. 

Since it's trading already 4x-5x the ICO price, I would like to take out my initial investment, the rest I will hold long term.

Trading on Etherdelta using Metamask is not really working though. The order book never seems up to date and there seems nothing can be done about it. I have however found some buy orders that I wanted and could execute, however there was always an error message: ""error in txn:bad jump destination"" 

Normal orders tend never to get to the order book even though etherdelta confirms that I have placed an order. Is there anything to fix this? 

Is there any requirement to gas that I am not fulfilling? I have used standard values always. Is there anything that can be done to make trades possible on etherdelta or are all the mistakes and slow updates a cause of too many people at the same time trying to do the same thing?

Reasons their fundraiser was such a nice experience:

- Fair: They required participants to register beforehand, verify their phone number and ETH contribution address, and then ensured those people would be able to purchase and equal share of tokens during the first day of the sale. This helped prevent whales from buying up the whole supply.
- Safe: By ensuring registrants could purchase an equal share of tokens on the first day, people did not need to rush (which often leads to people forgetting to verify URLs, contract addresses, etc.).
- Smooth: Even though the initial traffic slowed their servers to a grind, the 0x team was active on Twitter answering questions and reassuring people that there was no need to rush.

Further to this, the 0x team also had a working product online (with documentation!) and explained their token's utility before raising funds. This changes the fundraiser from ""Please give us money because we are thinking of building a product"" to ""We have a working and documented product and would love you to partner with us as we iterate on it.""

I hope future fundraisers will follow suit.",NA,"6u8vaz",NA,0,NA,"false",1504691371,"false","self","t5_3iw51","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/0xProject/comments/6u8vaz/a_note_on_the_0x_fundraiser_xpost_from/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,1

I was trying for about 4 hours to sell some of my ZRX on Etherdelta  but the platform was a complete disaster. Trade book was frozen for 20 minutes at a time. Submitted orders weren't actually submitted, transactions never confirmed, etc.

So anyway I started looking into the [OTC DApp](https://0xproject.com/otc/) combined with /r/tokentrade as a means to trade the ZRX. The way /r/tokentrade works is that you post a link in the sub to the 0x Fill order page and specify the terms in the title according to some format rules:

*  [SELL][TOKEN][PRICE][VOLUME]

So for example the title would be:[SELL][ZRX][.0009][5000] if you wanted to sell 5000 ZRX for .0009 each . 

I set up an order and managed to sell a bunch of ZRX very successfully (so the OTC is working great -- for those of you struggling to trade on Etherdelta, give it a shot -- this functionality, to trade ETH tokens in this way is the whole point of the 0x token as far as I understand).

I then saw a really great post in the sub:

* [BUY][ZRX][.001][15000]

Now ZRX was trading for .001 ETH when it was first listed directly after the token sale, so I thought it was a lucky good deal and jumped on it.  When I scrutinised the Order on 0xproject.com/otc, it all looked good so I went ahead. I saw 15000 ZRX and I saw .001 ETH.  Well, because of my lack of familiarity with the interface (you need to learn which numbers are the total, which the unit price) and excitement, I neglected to see that it was in fact 15000 ZRX for .0001 ETH, total. So .000000067 ETH per ZRX. Meaning I just sold 10000 ZRX for $0.2 USD. That hurts man, fuck.

The /r/tokentrade/ post disappeared and that was that. I'm pretty sure it was a setup which I fell for. I am always super vigilant when dealing crypto so being scammed for the first time was a huge wake up call, a reminder to always check it over one more time before confirming, that the brain suffers dangerous confirmation bias. 

20 minutes later 2000 ZRX landed in my ETH address from the buyer's address. So he/she had returned 20%, which makes me wonder if the OTC order was a scam or maybe just an error like my error. Anyway, I am grateful for that at least as I know I messed up and the crypto world is ruthless in this regard, so I got lucky to not lose it all. 

To the buyer (scammer), I would obviously really appreciate if you could send more back if it was some sort of mistake. Otherwise, fuck you very much (and thanks?).",NA,"6u8zn2",NA,0,NA,"false",1504691430,"false","self","t5_3iw51","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/0xProject/comments/6u8zn2/be_careful_with_0x_otc_trading_and_rtokentrade/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

The fact that the team did the following things and it went down so smoothly only means greater things are to come and further projects built on the 0x Protocol. 

*What was good about the ICO?*

- Pre-registration for the actual ICO using the CIVIC platform and a registered ethereum address.
- Over a thousand fake accounts were deleted prior to the ICO.
- Day 1 capped at 6.4*aprox ETH per participant. 81% of all the ZRX were gone the first day.
- Actually releasing a product piror to the ICO and having a number of other projects already working with its protocol.
- The team was responsive in all moments on slack, reddit and twitter.

Please correct me if I'm wrong but from my understanding of 0x it's basically an ebay/craiglist sort of marketplace where people post listings of what they want to sell and people will go through them looking at what they want to buy and buy it through the listings.

My question is..
How will this go far? It doesn't seem like a very long term investment to me. Maybe when 0x starts being used a lot it's market value will fly skyhigh until it reaches a certain high and will never pass the high because there is only so much useful functions one will need in order to do these trades.

Thanks for your  patience and your time claifying it with me

I am sure you are wondering how it is possible to ""deposit ZRX by mistake""--Well it is not! I deposited ZRX and the exchange gave me extra ZRX (for some reason unbeknown to me). Since I did not notice until after I got this message, I traded some of the extra ZRX to ETH without realizing. I withdrew about 14ETH, which even at the time was less than the 38000ZRX I owned.

I messaged the exchange owner back (I think its one guy running the entire operation from Costa Rica) and he stated that I ""committed a fraud."" He stated that I had to rebuy 40000ZRX, which had appreciated to more than my current account value.

The owner further told me that my actions were ""illegal"" and that my account would be banned. He stated that he consulted a number ""powerful lawyers"" and they all agreed with him that I am a “fraud.”
He must be watching a lot of the tv show Suits to think that my actions were ""illegal."" I am sick and tired of people getting scammed by these smaller (and sometimes bigger) exchanges.

- 0x tokens are signified in short form as ""ZRX"". These are classified as ""ERC-20 tokens"".

- ZRX can be sent to, stored in, and sent from: MyEtherWallet (aka MEW), Mist, Parity (via a Chrome extension) and a few other wallets like imToken.

- You can also send ZRX *to* your Ethereum wallet address: on your Ledger Nano S, your Trezor, or Metamask. However, in order to 'interact' with your ZRX (ie. view balances, send these tokens etc) you will need to connect these wallets to MEW. Always check the URL and look for MYETHERWALLET LLC [US] to ensure you are not connecting to a phishing site by mistake.

- To interact with your ZRX in Metamask, log-in to the Metamask Chrome extension, bring up MEW in the same browser, click ""View Wallet Info"" and check ""Metamask"". When your Metamask wallet appears in MEW, click ""View Tokens"". When sending from here, toggle the button next to the send address pane from ""ETH"" to ""ZRX"". After sending (signing) the transaction on the MEW screen you will also need to sign the transaction in Metamask.

- To interact with your ZRX in Mist/Ethereum wallet, you need to 'watch' the token. This requires clicking ""Contracts"", ""Watch Token"", and adding the token's contract address which you can find here: https://etherscan.io/token/ZRX

- Other applications like, Jaxx and Exodus, have separate wallets for a number of other ERC-20 tokens but are yet to add one for ZRX. You can send your ZRX to the Ethereum address on these applications but will need to import the passphrase or private key from those wallets into MEW before able to interacting with your ZRX tokens.

- Before sending ZRX from a wallet, you require some Ether in the same wallet to cover the cost of gas required to fuel such transactions. A small amount like a 0.01 ETH should suffice. By setting the Gwei price to ""1"" I have managed to reduce such transactions to as little as a couple of cents. If the transaction fails, set the Gwei to a higher figure like 4; for faster transactions set it to 21.

- When receiving, storing, and sending ZRX, these tokens will always remain seperate from your Ether and any other ERC-20 tokens held in the same Ethereum wallet.

- Exchanges also have their own wallets for ERC-20 tokens. When withdrawing ERC-20 tokens from an exchange, they will deduct a small (or sometimes not so small) amount of tokens from the amount you are due to receive as payment for this transaction. As such, you are *not* required to hold Ether in these wallets to pay for gas to fuel transactions. Furthermore, you risk losing your funds if sending Ether to an ERC-20 wallet on an exchange. For the same reason, **do not** send ERC-20 tokens *to* your Ether wallet on an exchange as these are not token-enabled. I stress this given the number of people who have made this mistake and subsequently encountered difficulties retrieving their tokens.

- You can follow the above procedure for any ERC-20 token. All that needs changing is the token contract address part. You can locate this by entering the token's name in the ""search token contract"" section of the following link: https://etherscan.io/token-search

My experiences from the start of 0x ICO on both exchanges up until now. 

EtherDelta:  
I quite like the overview. It's simple and easy to use. Using MetaMask was also interesting since I never used it before the 0x ICO. during the ICO I was able to make a few trades, but shortly after it was nearly impossible. I had numerous 'Bad Jump Errors' and cost me a lot of gas. Also the order book didn't update quick enough. 
Withdrawing went fine for me though. 

If the issues mentioned above will not be fixed I'm not going to use it anymore.

Liqui:  
The troll box is fun to read and sometimes just sometimes the stuff ppl talk about actually isn't bad. For example I've heard of some ICO which look interesting to me and registered for them. 

Trading went much easier than on ED. No issues for me trading ZRX to BTC or ETH.

Withdrawing on the other hand is another story. I made some profit and decided to get it out to get my investment back from the ICO. However, after clicking withdraw I got the error: ""Unable to verify if address is correct"". I made a ticket - never got any reply back - and also talked to the mod in the troll box. The only thing he said was ""try again later"". And so I did. After spamming the withdraw button it somehow managed to send it to my address. 

So in short I did trade and was able to withdraw what I wanted to, but not without a hassle. I'm really thinking of only trading on a bigger exchange in the future where I never had any issues on.

In case of any questions, shoot!

&amp;nbsp;

From what I can gather Kyber's biggest difference vs 0x is that it facilitates the decentralised exchange of any token, not just ERC20 based tokens. Kyber also has Vitalik on as an advisor, and he endorsed the founder's work on this [r/ethereum thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6ci9io/announcing_kybernetwork_an_onchain_instant_and/). If nothing else, Vitalik's endorsements do tend to create a lot of hype, which does seem to be the case here. Articles such as [this one](https://www.cryptoninjas.net/2017/08/20/kybernetwork-closes-ico-whitelist-early-due-registration-overflow/) are reporting massive registration numbers on the official Kyber Slack (Slack membership being one of the ways to get whitelisted for the ICO registration).

We are starting to see services like Shapeshift and Bitfinex ban US customers presumably as a precaution.

It seems there would be no liability for something like 0x, a decentralized exchange that doesn't act as counterparty.

Do you guys see 0x as a hedge against these regulations? Will people flee to 0x and etherdelta?

Final question: I'm not too familiar with 0x. Is there a clear, linear relationship between the trading/transaction volume and the volume of the coin?

Let's assume all relays charge 0.1% and have total trading volume $100m/day. It translates to $100k comissions/day in ZRX tokens.
So, traders buy $100k of ZRX every day! WOW, big deal!
But.
Relayer have to sell about the same amount of ZRX to pay bills and get profit. That is because ZRX is not a store of value, BTC and ETH are.
So, actually we have only average daily trading fees ($100k) locked in trader's reserves every day - that is ALL demand for the coin. Ok, let it be 7-day supply of ZRX for comissions - $0,7m . Compare it with current $200m supply to understand that demand from traders will not be suffitient to support price on current levels. 
For fees to be sufficient source of demand at current price levels trading volume should be at least x100.  $100m *100=10billions - more than overall crypto market trading volume what is impossible right now.

So we have only speculative component acting in the price of ZRX.

It then becomes a snowball effect, where scarcity increases and so does the value of the coin. Relayers now have more incentive to keep holding. People will still NEED ZRX to trade in a decentralized manner and therefore will continue to purchase/convert it, continuing to influence relayers to hold and drive up the value. It's going to continue to sell at an inflated price, because well, how else would you trade your coins p2p? Price goes up, relayers lower fees to maintain low-costs, yet people keep buying coins due to necessity. Sure you're thinking at this point, if the fees are lower, people simply need less coins to trade, thus lowering overall demand. True, however, not only are relayers holding, but investors also are realizing that it is non-inflationary and the price will continue to climb due to the absolute need. At which point, the amount of zrx held by relayers/investors (and out of circulation) will start to apply pressure on the decentralized exchange demand (utility of the coin if you will), creating a healthy demand for higher priced coins.


So while the amount of volume zrx will see across exchanges is certainly important, there is another force (holders) that will be applying pressure from the other end, squeezing the amount of coins in circulation and thus increasing the price.  A price at which people will continue to buy at, because there is real demand and exchanges can compensate for the price increase by lowering fees.  I don't expect this to happen immediately.  I suspect relayers will wait until its largely adopted and deeply rooted - it's at this point they will begin to hold, pump the price and the holder snowball effect will take place.

Their only recourse is Etherdelta (which unfairly gets a bad rap). 

0xprotocol IS the future away from centralized decisionmaking and listing. 

If Fred Ersham (the co-founder of Coinbase) speaks so confidently about it, then why are you panicking? Did Omise Go rocket overnight? Did NEO rocket overnight? Arguably 0x has a broader use case than both (or at least the former). 

Calm down. This is a good project. Invest your energy into doing something useful with it (heck, group together and start building relays - I'm down if anyone else is). Start building on top of the protocol.

Pro tip: Building order book matching systems is but 1 of MANY uses of the 0x protocol.

Personally, I think it's great to have options. New listings tend to be good as they increase access to the coin to others, which should increase value at least temporarily as people try to access a position.

Not sure why the value would tank just because of a binance listing in the face of such an exciting future ahead for the tech.

With an AXC transaction, two users on two different chains can make two transfer transactions that are committed together on both ledgers, or none at all (i.e. atomically). For example, two users can trade bitcoins for ether (or any two tokens on two different ledgers) using AXC transactions, even though Bitcoin and Ethereum are not connected to each other. The bene t of running an exchange on AXC transactions is that neither users need to trust each other or the trade-matching service. The downside is that both parties need to be online for the trade to occur.

Another type of decentralized exchange is a mass-replicated distributed exchange that runs on its own blockchain. Users on this kind of exchange can submit a limit order and turn their computer off, and the trade can execute without the user being online. The blockchain matches and completes the trade on behalf of the trader.

A centralized exchange can create a deep orderbook of limit orders and thereby attract more traders. Liquidity begets more liquidity in the exchange world, and so there is a strong network effect (or at least a winner-take-most effect) in the exchange business. The current leader for cryptocurrency exchanges today is Poloniex with a 24-hour volume of $20M, and in second place is Bit nex with a 24-hour volume of $5M. Given such strong network effects, it is unlikely for AXC-based decentralized exchanges to win volume over the centralized exchanges. For a decentralized exchange to compete with a centralized exchange, it would need to support deep orderbooks with limit orders. Only a distributed exchange on a blockchain can provide that.""

Next, when Ethereum started gaining traction, everyone realised its utility as a platform for providing smart contracts and dapps.  Once again, a bunch of cryptos popped up to provide value as a smart contract platform Lisk, Neo etc

Now with what we've all experienced recently around China regulation and banning of exchanges I think the next big 'thing' will be a huge rush to move all crypto trading to decentralized exchanges.

I sit here considering the choices I'm making and the impact they will have on them. I don't make irrational decisions and I don't weakly go in on something I don't believe in. I'm considering the thousands I'm investing while maintaining a sensibility in my investments as to not put us in the poor house in case of a bad play. With that in mind, I've went in pretty deep on 0x, and I know a lot of you have done the same. 

In a day when one of the biggest contributers to cryptocurrency (China) is being backed in a corner, the decentralized exchange is needed most. A protocol created to give such flexibility in trading tokens (beyond ERC20 tokens in the future as well) with the flexibility and allowance for innovation by relayers/exchanges is exactly what we need right now. 

There is a problem, and it is that there are so many out there that are still unaware of the solution, and others that are caught up in the hype of ideas and other platforms. Who can deliver on their promises remains to be seen, but how often in history has the better technology lost out due to another finding the community first?

A protocol that provides the building blocks and ""sky's the limit"" flexibility for relayers/exchanges to build on is a great proposition. To be able to create a traditional looking exchange, an exchange over your favorite social media platform, a trade between two independent parties, an exchange like Kyber or other variants, an exchange/relayer that works with other relayers to unite and are incentivized to build liquidity pools and order books, as well as various other options, is the solution most haven't realized yet but can be found here.

The team is hard working at providing this and does not, on the surface, seem to care about the monetary value of ZRX and has the approach that if you build a solid product it will pay off in the end.  This may be the right approach and everything is going according to plan.  However, as an investor in the technology and the ZRX token, I feel that we could be doing more to reach those that don't get it just yet.

Bottom line, as investors, we should be getting the word out. Let others make their choices as we've made ours, but give them the information they need to make those decisions and decide where to place their faith and dollars.

Youtube videos, reddit, twitter, instagrams, wechat, your weekend circle jerks, whatever! Anywhere they talk about the issues plaguing us, just inform them of the options out there. Just be heard and make a presence. In the end, that may make all the difference between success and failure.

Well, that was a load.. Time for another round. :) Salud!",NA,"70lckc",NA,0,NA,"false",1507532813,"false","self","t5_3iw51","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/0xProject/comments/70lckc/as_i_sit_here/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,1

  I know predictions in crypto are a hit or miss and it's ALL speculation. However, I'm just curious as to where you guys are this going. Will it ever be a viable option to the powerhouse currencies? Also, does anyone have any long term price predictions? 
I'm pretty heavily invested in 0x and I'm not going to lie - I got in at .35 cents. This was an absolute impulse buy so I do admit I am a little worried about my investment. Yes, I am one of those people who bought on the hype and went against my normal investing habits. However, I will hold until the very end because you technically never lose until you sell.   That is one of the key things I learned the hard way - YOU NEVER LOSE UNTIL YOU SELL. When I first dipped my feet in the water with investing in he stock market I assumed I would get rich quick on high risk investments. You know how people say with high risk there is high reward? Well, it's safe to say that is true however I was investing with money I COULD NOT AFFORD TO LOSE. So one bad investment lead to another and you get the picture.

Kind reminder for those who haven't seen that we would really like to see a Shapeshift like relayer to be built. The idea would be that the relayer would have a large liquidity (could be external) and would offer token pairs at a given price. This price could be updated every minute or so. Users would go on the website, see the current rate, decide to execute a trade at this agreed rate and the relayer will automatically fill the order. 

Such a service will have a strong demand from dApps, which will 95% of the time look for the best current market price and won't try ""hit the dip"" like regular traders. It is in my opinion that a shapeshift/changelly like relayer would most likely be the best candidate for dApps. 

You can find more relayers strategies here ;

From my research, and correct me if I'm wrong, I see that there are a decent number of competitors that are not complete jokes. You have projects like Kyber or Blocknet that appear to be pretty similar in function to 0x. 

On the other hand, you have developments such as Ethfinex or the ocean or RR that are utilizing the 0x protocol which could obviously boost the price quite a bit. Do the other projects have any potentially price-stimulating projects down the line? There’s a lot of discussion about which one will take off and become the “defining” DEX token and I don’t see any of the others at 0x’s level currently. 
If I have some misunderstanding please let me know. 

Also, does anyone know when phase 1 of Ethfinex will be? There's no date here:

##### **What is 0x?**    
At its core, 0x is an open and non-rent seeking protocol that facilitates trustless, low friction exchange of Ethereum-based assets. Developers can use 0x as a platform to build exchange applications on top of (0x.js is a Javascript library for interacting with the 0x protocol). For end users, 0x will be the infrastructure of a wide variety of user-facing applications i.e. 0x Portal, a decentralized application that facilitates trustless trading of Ethereum-based tokens between known counterparties.    

##### **What problem does 0x solve?**    
In the two years since the Ethereum blockchain’s genesis block, numerous decentralized applications (dApps) have created Ethereum smart contracts for peer-to-peer exchange. Rapid iteration and a lack of best practices have left the blockchain scattered with proprietary and application-specific implementations. As a result, end users are exposed to numerous smart contracts of varying quality and security, with unique configuration processes and learning curves, all of which implement the same functionality. This approach imposes unnecessary costs on the network by fragmenting end users according to the particular dApp each user happens to be using, eliminating valuable network effects around liquidity. 0x is the solution to this problem by acting as modular, unopinionated building blocks that may be assembled and reconfigured.    

##### **How is 0x different from a centralized exchange like Poloniex or ShapeShift?**   
* 0x is a protocol for exchange, not a user-facing exchange application.
* 0x is decentralized and trustless; there is no central party which can be hacked, run away with customer funds or be subjected to government regulations. Hacks of Mt. Gox, Shapeshift and Bitfinex have demonstrated that these types of systemic risks are palpable.
* Rather than a proprietary system that exists to extract rent for its owners, 0x is public infrastructure that is funded by a globally distributed community of stakeholders. While the protocol is free to use, it enables for-profit user-facing exchange applications to be built on top of the protocol.    

##### **If 0x protocol is free to use, where do transaction fees come in?**    
0x protocol uses off-chain order books to massively reduce friction costs for market makers and ensure that the blockchain is only used for trade settlement. Hosting and maintaining an off-chain order book is a service; to incent “Relayers” to provide this service they must be able to charge transaction fees on trading activity. Relayers are free to set their transaction fees to any value they desire. We expect Relayers to be highly competitive and transaction fees to approach an efficient economic equilibrium over time.    

##### **What types of digital assets are supported by 0x?**    
0x supports all Ethereum-based assets that adhere to the ERC20 token standard. There are many ERC20 tokens, worth a combined $2.2B, and more tokens are created each month. We believe that, by 2020, thousands of assets will be tokenized and moved onto the Ethereum blockchain including traditional securities such as equities, bonds and derivatives, fiat currencies and scarce digital goods such as video game items. In the future, cross-blockchain solutions such as Cosmos and Polkadot will allow cryptocurrencies to freely move between blockchains and, naturally, currencies such as Bitcoin will end up being represented as ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

##### **0x is open source: what prevents someone from forking the protocol?**
Ethereum and Bitcoin are both open source protocols. Each protocol has been forked, but the resulting clone networks have seen little adoption (as measured by transaction count or market cap). This is because users have little to no incentive to switch over to a clone network if the original has initial network effects and a talented developer team behind it. An exception is in the case that a protocol includes a controversial feature such as a method of rent extraction or a monetary policy that favors one group of users over another (Zcash developer subsidy - for better or worse - resulted in Zclassic). Perceived inequality can provide a strong enough incentive that users will fork the original protocol’s codebase and spin up a new network that eliminates the controversial feature. In the case of 0x, there is no rent extraction and no users are given special permissions. 0x protocol is upgradable. Cutting-edge technical capabilities can be integrated into 0x via decentralized governance (see section below), eliminating incentives to fork off of the original protocol and sacrifice the network effects surrounding liquidity that result from the shared protocol and settlement layer.    

#0x Token

##### **Explain how the 0x protocol token (zrx) works**
0x protocol token (ZRX) is utilized in two ways: 1) to solve the coordination problem and drive network effects around liquidity, creating a feedback loop where early adopters of the protocol benefit from wider adoption and 2) to be used for decentralized governance over 0x protocol's update mechanism. In more detail:
* ZRX tokens are used by Makers and Takers (market participants that generate and consume orders, respectively) to pay transaction fees to Relayers (entities that host and maintain public order books).
* ZRX tokens are used for decentralized governance over 0x protocol’s update mechanism which allows its underlying smart contracts to be replaced and improved over time. An update mechanism is needed because 0x is built upon Ethereum’s rapidly evolving technology stack, decentralized governance is needed because 0x protocol’s smart contracts will have access to user funds and numerous dApps will need to plug into 0x smart contracts. Decentralized governance ensures that this update process is secure and minimizes disruption to the network.

##### **Why must transaction fees be denominated in 0x token (ZRX) rather than ETH?**
0x protocol’s decentralized update mechanism is analogous to proof-of-stake. To maximize the alignment of stakeholder and end user incentives, the staked asset must provide utility within the protocol.

##### **How will decentralized governance work?**
Decentralized governance is an ongoing focus of research; it will involve token voting with ZRX. Ultimately the solution will maximize security while also maximizing the protocol’s ability to absorb new innovations. Until the governance structure is formalized and encoded within 0x DAO, a multi-sig will be used as a placeholder.

# Team

##### **Where is 0x based?**
0x was founded in SF and is driven by a diverse group of contributors.

##### **Why the name 0x?**
0x is the prefix for hexadecimal numeric constants including Ethereum addresses. In a more abstract context, as the first open protocol for exchange 0x represents the beginning of the end for the exchange industry’s rent seeking oligopoly: zero exchange.

The new airswap ico is a good project to buy at ico and flip. I imagine the people who sold off 0x yesterday did to recoup their losses in 0x. Hey congratulations on seeing an opportunity in the market and profiting for it. We're all in here to make money. But their project goals are already completed with 0x, their roadmap is WAY far behind, and no other development teams on board to actually build on their protocol when 0x has 8+. To be honest, this sounds a lot like Lisk which is having a healthy marketcap too btw, but all the solutions they claim to solve are already solved by ETH. Remember, the reason why ETH is worth 30 bill while lisk is at 0.5bil is because DEVELOPERS are where the VALUE is at. 

As for the kyber network, it's only main selling point is that vitalik is an advisor. They claim that 0x won't have the liquidity that they will have. Yeah ok dude. Your one exchange is going to take on all of 8+ exchanges, while we will have specialized exchanges (such as the dy/dx margin trading) AND payment platforms such as the request network, which will help bridge mainstream FIAT into ETH. 

Let's not forget this is a project built between Coinbase and Bitfinex, pretty much the biggest companies in North America responsible for putting mainstream FIAT currency into crypto. Key members of their team were part of the angel investors in this project. That tells me ZRX will eventually be listed on coinbase when it's ready to deliver. (I imagine they did all their dealings and talks in a penthouse mansion overlooking the SF bay)

Which is why the new round of investors will be using ETHFINEX over Kyber to be purchasing their ETH. Don't forget we have the power of USDT (400mil market cap so far) on our side. The mainstream investors will want to trade crypto against the dollar and will be using familiar services. User experience is everything. This is the brainchild project of two of crypto's biggest companies where they have years of  experience (which is extremely rare in crypto btw) in managing exchanges. 

Anyways this is not investment advice, I imagine the bear to continue down (it seems a lot of the erc-20's are in anticipation for eth's update) but I'm going to continue buying up to the 0.0005/eth range. 

As Jesus once said, ""The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient."" As you all may know, he then became to be one of the most successful investors of all time.

However, with the price stagnant for now, anyone care to counter my devil's advocate points below?

1. It's extremely likely that ERC-20 coins will NOT be the focus of crypto in the coming years. EOS and NEO could upend ETH. Interest in ERC-20 coins could take a backseat to the latest offers on these new blockchains. A protocol that allows for ERC-20 token trading, is therefore unlikely to ever get real traction.

2. If ZRX could allow for direct trades between ANY coins, then it would be a game changer, but that's all just hope. There has been no official announcement that this is actually possible or on the roadmap.

3. For ZRX to have real value, a huge percentage of current ERC-20 traders would need to change the way that they trade (away from exchanges). People are lazy and set in there ways. There is unlikely to be a huge shift until it becomes a burden to trade on a number of the larger exchanges. There isn't real reason to believe that is coming. Indeed, exchanges would likely drop fees if ZRX was ever perceived to be a threat. If you've got 50 coins on Bittrex and another 25 on Bitfinex, how likely are you going to be to make the effort to move them?

4. There exists no idiot proof working product and it could be years before it is simple and easy to actually use this tech.

5. If a smarter group of people come along soon and build a system for allowing the trade of any token for any other, there will be little interest in ZRX.

That's the FUD that comes in my head when I realise my exposure to ZRX and see the stagnant price.

If the amount of zrx held by relayers scales with average volume, it would be great for the coin but if relayers feel like a fixed amount of voting influence is enough, volume won't be as important as the number of relayers on the network. 

It seems like the bigger your volume, the more you risk by allowing smaller relayers to potentially change the rules against your interest. It follows that most relayers will hold some zrx in proportion to their volume. However, if the protocol rarely changes, maybe relayers can get by without holding much zrx until a big decision (probably on scaling) comes up for a vote. 

As a zrx holder I will only voluntarily use relayers that hold a ratio of volume in zrx. I imagine it makes sense for relayers to favor other relayers who support zrx as well, creating some network effects for relayers with a policy of supporting zrx.

This is CoinGate. We are a cryptocurrency payment processor and we couldn’t be more glad about the growth and changes in this exciting new industry. 

However, we find it insufficient that many people are seeing cryptos like ZRX as merely an asset. Despite the relatively low adoption of cryptocurrencies by merchants, our team is very positive about the future of cryptocurrencies for payments, and we are excited to offer our services to all the online merchants out there.

That is actually why we are reaching out to you, the people who have an honest interest in cryptocurrencies, their further development and real-world use cases. We want to let you know that we have integrated with ShapeShist what allows us to incorporate ZRX payments on our invoices. So, if you ever come across a merchant using CoinGate, you definitely can spend your 0x tokens there. At this time, we are also working on making it the payment process even smoother. 

Actually, if you are using ZRX frequently and want to have the option to pay with it - we would be more that happy if you share it with your favourite merchants. And if you have any feedback or questions for CoinGate, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Regards, 
CoinGate

I started using Radar Relay yesterday and it is just great. So I'm taking steps to prepare for life with 0x relayers.

So far I have been tracking my trades using Google Sheets by **manually** input every trade. But I notice that 0x protocol allows us to check balance and trade history across different relayers. It seems to me that in theory I can record my trades automatically using 0x.js. I know very little about javascript, so I hope someone here can help me out.

Is there a way I can fetch trade history, including fees, to Google Sheets, possibly using 0x.js?

Many thanks!

My questions stems from order generation. 

I understand that when a `maker` generates an order, the result is a JSON snippet with information about the order. When a `taker` comes in to fill the order, his signing of the transaction seemingly signs for both people. How is this so? I see no transaction on behalf of the `maker` at the time of order generation, but I do ssee one at the time that the `taker` signs the transaction.

My assumption is that it has something to do with the `signature` section of the JSON output. If so, how do you generate that, programmatically (either with 0x.js or something else)? When using MetaMask, a popup asks you to sign a transaction. Is this just simply generating the raw transaction, but not broadcasting it to the network? Does this raw tx get used when the `taker` signs?

Edit: I am reading [here](https://0xproject.com/wiki#Message-Format) in the docs that `The order originator signs the order hash with their private key to produce an ECDSA signature.` If this is the case, then I believe my above assumptions are correct. My question that follows is now how do you generate this hash and sign it? I'm guessing it is available in the 0x.js lib, but can I do this with web3.py?

And there won't be any KYC restrictions since, duh... these are decentralized exchanges.

But how confident are we that regulators will not place some sort a KYC requirement even on decentralized exchanges? Have this topic been thoroughly discussed before?

I mean, the whole point of KYC (or at least the stated main goal) is to prevent money laundering, terrorist funding, and other nefarious activities. If DEXs are suddenly going to become popular, and large amounts of value start going through them, do you think regulators/law makers will just say ""oh it's a DEX so we should just let it be""? I think there is a real political/regulatory risk here that regulators will put in some sort of a KYC burden on DEXs. 

Could they seriously enforce these requirements? They can definitely force the DEXs and the people who provide the protocol to play ball and setup KYC checkpoints.

When interacting with the 0x protocol, there is not a current way to have a smart contract act as a taker since it cannot sign an order. Therefore, to build a system that would handle many trades on a users behalf would require the user to sign every single transaction OR have to trust the devs of such a system to properly handle their transactions.

Would something like this be possible in the future? Would there be a wider benefit to something like this? Curious to hear the thoughts of the community.

Why wouldn't I just make an app which interfaced with either IDEX or Etherdelta, or another DEX when they come about? Even though they might be ""worse"", they're a lot easier to get started with since there are no prerequisites.

I'm not trying to sling shit or FUD, I just want to be able to present a solid case to my users as to why they should obtain ZRX to use my dapp, because the only reason I have to give them currently is ""because the devs of the backend system that this dapp uses want money"". That's not a compelling reason.

I understand ""network effect"" and all that crap, just give me some good reasons. Theoretically you could have built ZRX into the system at some point in the future right, once you HAVE a network effect.

https://www.airswap.io/

This project has a lot of hype besides the CNBC coverage. Bloomberg wrote a long piece on AirSwap and mentioned how the co-founder of AirSwap, Michael Oved, was a partner at Virtu, a high frequency trading firm. “Virtu gained fame for only losing money on a single day from 2009 to 2014 as it matched buyers and sellers in stocks, bonds, futures and currencies.” 

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-28/upending-digital-currency-market-is-next-act-for-ex-virtu-trader

AirSwap also was mentioned in a coindesk article. https://www.coindesk.com/former-virtu-trader-plans-cryptocurrency-exchange-overhaul/

The advisors range from Joe Lubin (Ethereum Founder) to Bill Tai (lead investor in BitFury) 

It looks like order books are still a sticking point with Airswap and to me it seems like 0x pushing for as many relayers as possible makes sense.

Request Network for example will be using the Ox protocol as part of their stack, and their hope is to be transacting Paypal level volume of transactions on a daily basis. I think, in terms of Ox seeing their maximum potential (and the ZRX token going up in value), they need more companies like Request to commit to using Ox in varied ways. I'm interested to see if Ox becomes a common backend tech for other DApps- which I think is the ultimate goal and has a likelihood of happening.

2) Is there a way to include an AMM smart contract? Do you have suh protocol? There is Bancor, is it possible to integrate it as well with 0x?

Help me test it.","So, yeah, I built a relay on top of the 0x protocol and now I need some volume to test this thing. You can also use the Kovan testnet if you have some tokens to play around with.

I've set the fees to 0 on both the testnet and mainnet. I will keep them 0 until there's enough volume for me to make this a full time job. So, it will probably stay 0 forever.

I've only tested it with MetaMask, so I don't know if other web3 browsers will work. Let me know if they don't.

At the moment, you can only trade a token for ETH (WETH) and vice versa, because it's a really confusing experience if you can trade any token for any other token. But I might consider enabling it in the future.

A few features:

* No registration

* Zero fees

* Trollbox for all your trolling needs

* You can share your orders on the web. When you create an order, there's a ""share"" button to the right that generates a URL and sharing buttons for Facebook, Twitter, etc. When people land on this URL, the order will be displayed and information whether or not the viewer can fill the order (based on the data from their MetaMask wallet).

I guess everyone on this subreddit want ZRX to go to 1$.

Honestly this is quite easy. 

The hardest part is already done which is creating the tech.

Funny enough most cryptos out there don't have this. 

So how do we increase the price I hear you ask.

Simply talk about it. Even if you have the best idea ever and you execute it perfectly you're not gonna sell anything without marketing it. 

So it's quite easy. If you want the price to rise just talk about it. Nothing more nothing less.

Just drop the name in a trollbox, meantion it in a discussion about crypto or write about it on facebook. 

That's how you can get ZRX to 0.5$ 1$ 5$ or 10$ for that matter

Bitfinex - It'd good promote Ox project, Ethfinex to existing many Bitfinex users.

Bittrex - Worldwide altcoin market. Also when a coin list on Bitttrex, it means it will be on Korean market which is huge (thanks to a Korea exchange partnered with Bittrex).

Advisors are amazing as well. This coin is unfortunately one of the few ones not getting mainstream awareness. The game should be played now and not later. Now that devs are in the euphoria to create Dapps / exchanges on top of ETH. It’s unfair but as a ex startup CEO, I know for a fact than Media coverage sometimes gives a less good tech the advantage of success.  It’s all about timing and creating a nice story. 
It’s maybe part of the company strategy. But in my opinion this is a mistake. Their goal number one should be to create a dev community and relayers as fast as they can. Not having a dedicated PR and just one team member as a dev. Evangelist is very weak to get on headlines. Even if this is a young tech, medias Love to dream and 0x could have a nice story to say about the tokenized future and  a big highway of coverage. And this could also create confidence for entrepreneurs to choose their tech and remove the question “ Am I doing a mistake using 0x?”
I’m a in their top 300 token holder and a believer in their vision but I’m so frustrated I can’t help in this adventure. I was even ready to work for them and sent them an email in that purpose. 
If they hear my message, all of this is not criticizing but constructive as you’re still in the early days of the product. But please get yourself some free exposure that will boom your tech awareness to the general public and developer community all over the planet!

However, building a DEX on 0x is trivial enough that if 0x ever picks up you'll have a plethora of exchanges, forcing trading fees to tend towards zero. So the value prop of the token being used for fees will vanish.

Additionally, people don't want 1000 alternative platforms to trade on, excessive choice imposes a burden on the customer. And this is exactly what such an easy deployment of exchanges invites.

One of the princi reason why people are sticking with ED, they don't want to go shopping for alternatives, because it's unpleasant. 

Now maybe they'll head over to IDEX or Radar Relay, but then there's 0xExchange2, SexyDexERC20999 etc etc

What will happen is what happened in the centralized crypto exchange space. 

The market is absolutely dominated by an extreme minority. 

The abundance of exchanges was caused by the lower regulatory and technical cost of running one as compared to an exchange for a more formal financial product.This reduces the cost even further.

Generally, the value prop of building an exchange was that it was complex enough, technically and with regulatory barriers that there would be sufficiently little competition that you could attract enough volume to make a substantial profit.

So what's the end goal? A bunch of illiquid exchanges, and an exchange explorer that aggregates them? Instead of that exchange explorer you could've just had one well built DEX not even using the 0x protocol.

More DEX interfaces != more orders.

So what do you think the point of 0x is? Why do you think it has value? 

Having said that I think  0x's OTC is innovative to me because it allows John to quickly create an order, then send it to Jane to trade, or post it within some sort of community (e.g. /r/tokentrade), for it to be filled. It's truly decentralized and allows people to trade on their own terms with zero fees.

But once again, it's only useful because a middle man won't charge fees.",NA,"7fj0ha",NA,0,NA,"false",1512306626,"false","self","t5_3iw51","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/0xProject/comments/7fj0ha/why_do_you_think_0x_has_value/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

Here is a potential use case I found and would like your feedback on it. 

The big problem I see in mainstream adoption of dApps is the need for multiple tokens to use a dApp. For example if a dApp is build using Aragon, district0x, 0x and Request, a normal user would need to own all these tokens in order to use that dApp.
Could 0x solve the problem of having to own all these tokens to use the dApp by quickly exchanging ETH for all these tokens using the shared liquidity pool and enabling the user to only spend ETH for dApp usage? 

I know that Bancor is trying to solve this problem however I think that the dApp owner would need to fill the pool with tokens himself for that to work. I find that the 0x method could be simpler to use no?

Another parallel I see is with BNB token of Binance. It started for just paying the fees, but is quickly evolving in its use case and has gotten its own BNB market already. Could ZRX become the preferred market for these tokens?

If anyone has any other interesting use cases Please do share them here.

So here I would like to explain my own opinion and I invite you to describe yours as well.

So, main reasons are:

- strong competition. There are lots of projects that look alike 0x. These are Kyber,  in some way OmiseGo (related to decentralised exchanges), in some way Raiden Network and others. There are already functioning decentralised exchanges - Etherdelta;

- it is not necessary to buy 0x tokens to use products built on 0x protocol (many projects decide to make 0 fees). Consequently, the demand for ZRX is lower than the supply;

- Bitcoin hardforks and ICOs. Atm ZRX costs 4 times its ICO price. Many holders decide to exit with profit and to invest in ICOs, BTC or ETH.

These, as I understand are main reasons.",NA,"7eg0ne",NA,0,NA,"false",1512286817,"false","self","t5_3iw51","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/0xProject/comments/7eg0ne/why_zrx_still_02_my_5/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

I had a small amount of free time so I decided to create an aggregator. I spent a few hours gathering social media links, icons, and crypto youtube channels. Every few minutes the content is pulled through the various API's organized by upload/creation timestamp and finally displayed in chronological order. Here are the page breakdowns: 
 
**Dashboard/Homepage** Displays a mix of content from all cryptocurrencies and crypto youtubers

**Coin Page** Displays content from crypto youtubers only

**Crypto Youtube Content** Display filtered content based on the cryptocurrency you selected, Also displays the social media, github, and tradingview ( chart forcasts ) links I could find

*Each page displays content in chronological order*

I will continue to add onto this service during my free time, including adding additional news/social media outlets. If you have any suggestions visit the [Feature Request](http://metavs.net/feature-request) page to submit a new idea.

I was reminded I promised some tutorials on how to build a relayer and how to interact with them, but I don't recall having posted them on our Reddit. 

We published about a month ago a tutorial on [how to Create, Validate and Fill order with 0x.js](https://www.0xproject.com/wiki#Intro-Tutorial:-Create,-Validate,-Fill-Order) and we just published this week a tutorial on [how to use 0x Connect](https://www.0xproject.com/wiki#Intro-Tutorial:-Connect), the 0x library to easily interact with Relayer's API.

We will soon make more tutorials such as how to interact with the exchange.sol smart contract from another contract. Let us know if you have questions, we would be delighted to help :).

I understand the utility of Ether as a gas to make transaction on the ETH blockchain.

The 0x protocol will work with 0x tokens, right?

so the 0x token is only interesting for the relayers?

is this the factor that makes the 0x token valuable?

why should it increase in price?
does it have potential to experience a not onyl aprice increase but an increase of worth like ETH is needed and rises in worth ?

i somewhere read that this is not the case for 0x 

please enlighten me.

we are gathering feedback for our new project [EasyTrade.io](https://easytrade.io) that is built on top of 0x platform. It is basically a **Decentralized Shapeshift** application that using a smart contract can execute orders from any 0x exchange and EtherDelta.

You just tell EasyTrade the amount of tokens and its robot will buy or sell them for you using the best rates from decentralized exchanges. No need to buy ZRX tokens or wrap ethers (it does it for you).

The dapp cannot buy a token for more than the maximum price you set and it cannot sell a token for less than the minimum price you set. You can find more information about the smart contract [here](https://easytrade.io/contract)

If you are interested, go ahead and [try it out](https://easytrade.io). Be aware that is an alpha version running on Rinkeby Testnet.

Also check our [FAQ](https://easytrade.io/faq)

Right now we are still in a early phase, but we are looking for anyone who is interested in this project, to either chat with us or join our team. Also, if you have a relayer that implements the [0x Standar Relayer API](https://github.com/0xProject/standard-relayer-api) and want EasyTrade to execute your orders, do not hesitate to contact us.

We are a team based in Sweden and currently working on our project called ""INSO"" (Insomni0x) . It is based on our VR project which was initiated back in Apr 2016, and we evolved our concept September this year.
INSO is basically a crypto trading interface in VR which will be available for all the daydream ready smartphone users. So we are taking a step into the MobileVR market segment and our application will be based on Google's daydream platform. We are also planing to use 0x protocol to make INSO the first DEX on a MobileVR platform. The entire UI/UX will be different, and the ways interactions when you execute trades will also be unique in its way. Our aim is of course not to replace the current web based exchanges, but to provide an rather interesting option for the traders out there who seeks a unique trading experience.


There is also a hardware part of INSO, and is is known as ""Gear Insomnia"" (a lot of people asked why insomnia on our meetups and tech conferences, does it have anything to do with sleep? Our answer is no, it is named like this because the volatility of crypto market, and when you are trading or have invested money into this market, you are often sleepless because of the volatility. ) Anyway, Gear Insomnia was also based on pur previous VR hardware project which was aimed to solve smartphone overheating and rapid battery drain issues during MobileVR experiences. Now it is designed to be a free gift for our early adopters and Pre-sale participants.
In our daydream application, there are a few features that are also included. The first feature called ""The vault"" is it basically a token wallet, but instead the wallet is visualized as a vault in your virtual trading environment, and users will be able to interact with it, the tokens held in the vault are also visualized using 3D objects.


The second feature are the virtual rooms, which is basically an empty virtual space based on blockchain which will allow users to customize and decorate. It can be used as a public place where traders get together and trade together or talk together. Companies will also be able to setup virtual ICO events and other crypto related events in their virtual rooms.


The third thing is our ERC20 based tokens called Prism Shards (PMS) with a max supply of 2 billions. Is it used as a currency in our virtual spaces and marketplace where people can purchase tickets to virtual crypto conferences, virtual objects that can be used to decorate their virtual rooms. Note that the entire project is dedicated to crypto space and market. So all the virtual objects and events held in this virtual place will be crypto related.
The fourth and the last of the features is called Prism Shards Generator (PSG) it is basically a virtual mining machine that can be purchased using Prism Shards, and in return a certain percentage of the sales in the entire virtual market place will be dived to PSG holders. Note that the PSG is also represented by a 3D object inside the virtual space.


Right now we are still in a early phase, and we are looking for everyone who are interested in this project, to either join our team or start a community. Don't be hesitated to let me know what you think about this concept or want to be a part of this project.

First things first, let me present myself; I’m a male student in my early 20s, fellow hodler of a couple of different coins and strong supporters of a lot of project (don’t have the fund to invest everywhere though, but will keep to diversify overtime). Even though I have been really interested in cryptocurrencies for less than a year, I only discovered the extent of the reddit community a few months ago (which is why my account is quite recent)! 
This presentation is to be as transparent as possible; if you feel that I should tell you which crypto I hold or which projects I believe in, please tell me so, I will paste this small text on each crypto subreddit I’m part of so please don’t mark me as spam, I want to have the widest possible reach :)

I’m currently writing an analysis of the public behind cryptocurrencies and a review of the reactions of larger entities (mostly medias, governments and banks) towards this innovation for uni. The idea is « to make an anthropological argument about globalisation ».

The scope of my study is within a class of « Anthropology of globalisation » (not a theoretical approach, simply the name of the class). As the main “goal” behind cryptocurrencies is to bring an end/renewal to (financial, bureaucratic, governmental) centralisation and fight corruption. Because of that, the “old” institutions are trying to stop their development or to have control over their development. Obviously, they are failing to stop the development of cryptocurrencies as the total market cap is growing stronger and stronger every day. Yet, they are slowly but surely trying to gain control of some of them and some will end up being centralised (just like E-Coin in Mr. Robot (the tv-show that got me into crypto, highly recommend, this show is the shit)).

The main theories I’m going to try to put forward are the following: 
- The concept of « Nation-State » 
- The « Center Periphery Model »
- The « Path Dependency theory (the one developed by Paul Pierson)

I believe that cryptocurrencies reflect the public’s view of institutions; the less we trust them, the higher the market cap will go (there is a theory for this I believe, but I don’t know the name so if you can help a brother out haha).

As I’m going to write on this I’d like to ask you a couple questions and as much advices as I can get (it’s my first anthropology class so if you know of good theories to apply, do not hesitate to share)! If you believe that I didn’t ask the good question, or formulated them in an improper way, please tell me so, I’m eager to learn from my mistakes. 

Here are the questions I’d like you to answer (btw, as said before, do not hesitate to reformulate them, tell me they’re irrelevant, extend them, create new ones,…) :)

- What is your age, sex, nationality and level of education?

- When did you enter the cryptocurrencies/blockchain market? And why did you enter the market at this time? Is it because of profit or something else?

- To your eyes, what solution can cryptocurrency X/cryptocurrencies bring to our society (here, you can either talk about one project or the whole ecosystem)? Why? Is it because of the blockchain technology and smart contracts, decentralisation, both, something else? 

- Why are “older” institutions trying to stop/control the development of cryptocurrencies? What are these institutions able to do/doing that cryptocurrencies are currently unable to do/will never be able to do? 

- Do you believe that “older” institutions and cryptocurrencies are able to work together? Or are they too different/have different objectives/values?

- Do you think that cryptocurrencies will ever be able to take away a country’s decision power over financial policies? 

- How do you feel about our current society and the type of society cryptocurrencies may bring to us? 

- Do you know of any news articles/official documents/studies (please, post them if you know of some, it would ease my task haha)? 

- … 

Tl;dr - study on crypto, might be cool to help out just check the questions

Thank you in advance for your help! :D

Some of these teams will face problems going forward as their actual business operations matches poorly with their token mechanics.
I am thinking specifically about teams with income in other cryptocurrencies except their own or even FIAT and/or teams which have legal problems with either paying dividents or using buy&amp;burn functions.
In the first case the use of an internal token makes less and less sense. In the second case I think more and more teams will need flexibility in how they reward token holders.



Example: Golem. Golem's tokens buys network computer power, but what if users have no interest whatsoever in crypto tokens but still want to make use of the platform? You can easily imagine a medium size company simply being denied the service by their own legal department because they do not want to touch crypto or because their accounting department simply is not set up to handle crypto. Golem could potentially just accept FIAT but the problem is now how to transfer this to GNT holders if legal issues or token mechanics prevent either dividents or buy&amp;burn.



Solution: use 0x with some small changes. The team in question would simply set up a buy order for their own token, but instead of coins being transferred to the team, they would get burned instead.

Example: Golem team sets up a GNT/DAI buy order. GNT holders sells the team GNT for DAI. Buyer gets DAI, GNT gets burned.

This would enable any team to get buy&amp;burn function for their token without them taking the legal risk.

How doable is this?
On the top of my head this could apply to



Polkadot



IPFS



Golem



RexMLS

You go ahead and send your tokens to the smart contract and within minutes they are withdrawn from it into a ""main"" account (or set of accounts?) and start showing up in your Poloniex deposit history.

I've deposited ZRX into my Poloniex address many times and the scenario above always holds true.

When I tried to do it this morning, the funds went into the contract, but were never pulled out. They don't show up in the Deposit History.

I've checked the address that normally ""fetches"" the funds and no new tokens have been retrieved since Dec-07, 11:35 PM +UTC: https://etherscan.io/address/0xead6be34ce315940264519f250d8160f369fa5cd (that's more than 15 hours before the creation of this Reddit post)

There's many previous posts discussing the price of ZRX, both optimistic and pessimistic, but they tend to make a case by focusing on just one particular aspect of ZRX's tokenonmics, like governance or token velocity, rather than the whole picture.

Like most tokens and cryptocurrencies, ZRX doesn't have a well-defined intrinsic value (unlike a token backed by a commodity like DGX or perhaps like a burning token might), and can likely exist at multiple equilibrium price points, but local supply/demand dynamics still operate at each of these price points.

The way I see it -- speculation aside -- is that ZRX has a fixed supply and three sources of demand:

* Taker demand. This is the high velocity / ""recycled"" nature of ZRX people talk about: when a taker buys ZRX off the market at the same time they are taking an order off of a 0x order book (i.e. fee abstraction). This ZRX can essentially be bought by one user and then immediately resold to another user a block later, at nearly the same price. Under the most conservative view -- being that a frequent taker chooses **not** to put aside and hold any ZRX for future trades -- you can assume this demand puts zero upwards pressure on the price.

* Maker demand. This is the more quantifiable source of demand. For **any** 0x order to exist on a 0x order book, there has to be a proportional (in the case of a more traditional exchanges) or fixed (in the case of [OpenRelay](https://openrelay.xyz/) and future fixed fee model relayers) amount of ZRX set aside to pay for the maker fees for when the trade is taken. ZRX bought and set aside for the fulfillment of future maker fees is ZRX supply withheld from the market. In general, this means that as the 0x ecosystem scales with trading volume, the demand component for maker fees scales and puts upward pressure on the price. If total trading volume keeps increasing, the price pressure keeps increasing.

* Governance demand. As of yet, the specifics of the governance process have not been defined, but if the protocol succeeds, there's bound to be competing vested interests in its direction of development, especially considering how many relayers are building on top of the protocol today (several of which are companies which have done no ICO fundraising, and presumably have a business model based on running a 0x relayer alone). Hoarding ZRX for increased governance stake would withhold ZRX supply from the market and put upwards pressure on the price, though it's not clear yet at what scale this will be.

TLDR: my two cents are total ZRX demand = taker demand + maker demand + governance demand. Taker demand = at worst ~0, maker demand = proportional to resting volume across all 0x order books, governance demand = future hoarding by relayers but hard to quantify right now. It's an interesting aspect of the token that its price may be more sensitive to maker orders than takers.

On most centralized exchanges you get the option of opting into USD/USDT, giving you the ability to sit on the side lines in a uncomfortably volatile market or perhaps while waiting to pick your spots. 

However, in DEX’s we don’t have that option, unless of course I’m mistaken.

Is this where stable coins like basecoin (eventually) or DAI come into play? If I understand correctly, stable coins still have to be pegged to an asset, like DAI is to MakerDao.

If stable coins are indeed the answer, then how can the underlying base coin handle excess volume. For example, if 50% (just to pick a random number) of the Eth market decided to cash into a stable coin ($65b give or take) how could DAI handle that when MakerDao is only worth $1b?

I would appreciate any insights or corrections wherever I’m mistaken.

Thanks!

I've noticed that there are some DEXes (DDEX, Ethfinex) that have a concept of ""depositing"". That seems to be a a transfer of ETH to an address they control.

Isn't this against the principles of Decentralized Exchanges? Radar Relay, for example, works straight from a MetaMask/Ledger wallet. I mean, apart from the WETH thing.

Is wrapping ETH what DDEX and Ethfinex are doing as well? If so, they're doing a very poor job of explaining it.

Our idea is to create an exchange using 0x protocool for faster and cheaper trading.

We will be aiming to implement the listing of newly created ERC20 token post ICO.



The idea behind this is that we would like to create an Exchange that is easier to use than our competitors and will allow token trading before it hits the bigger exchanges.

There are additional ideas involved in this project that can be discussed with interested parties.

The positions we have available are as follows : 


Creative Writer, 
Advisors (Project development/Legal etc)

If ERC20 trades on 0x can be off chain, what prevents someone from spending that same ERC20 on chain to an alternative address if the price moves against them?

Also, the liquidity question... using 0x, is there essentially a single channel for each ERC20 pair? So EVERYONE that is trading DAI and SPANK on 0x are pooled together and relayers listening on a common wire can match the trades? So whether that DAI:SPANK trade originated on EthFinex, RadarRelay, or a Twitter post... someone listening to all three networks could match the buyer/seller to complete the trade?

I gave up, chalking it up to them being in beta and it probably just being a bug.

Just tried again, and just getting a spinner when I try to wrap ETH from my Metamask wallet.  

Has anyone actually been able to use Radar Relay yet?  Are there any video tutorials?  

I'm using what I believe very high gas fees - 50 GWEI ($3) on a 0.05 ETH ($50) transaction, but still...nothing.  Meta mask says: ""Taking too long?  Try increasing your gas price."", which I've already done once, up to 50 from 30 GWEI.

As much as I want DEX to succeed, most transactions on the ETH network are cost prohibitive at best, and more often than not simply fail from my experience.

These are good problems to have -- it means there's a lot of demand.  But as a user, this is frustrating.  What type of scaling solutions will actually make a dent in this terrible user experience this year, and when can we expect them?  Is there anything 0x or their relayers can do directly to sidestep these issues, or is everyone basically in the same boat together on this one rowing upstream?

The more responses, the more accurate the survey.

&gt;We’re currently collecting the cost of one transaction from each side of each filled order
&gt;

Does this mean Makers are paying 0.15% + gas costs of the fill? If this is true how will i know what my fees are when my order gets filled? If it is a long lived order and gas price goes up could i pay a lot more in fees than when i placed the order?

The ""Price Adjustments"" section is just confusing. Does this mean a taker gets a rebate if they place an order far below or above a maker's order and it gets matched?

&gt;Because our fees are deducted from the proceeds of an order, they are paid in the denomination of the token you are receiving in your trade.
&gt;

This means Paradex won't be taking fees in ZRX or using ZRX at all? I thought part of the 0x protocol was about using ZRX token as a fee token? How does this affect ZRX as a utility token if relayers can avoid taking fees in it?

Scenario 1- Fixed ZRX fee.  This would be like the fixed trade fee of stock exchanges.  If the value of ZRX would get too high, it would be too expensive for the smaller traders.  Bye-bye micro-trading bots and small timers.

Scenario 2- fixed percentage of trade value , but converted to an amount to be charged in ZRX.  If this was the case, value of ZRX would not matter, since you are pegging the fee to the traded coin anyways.  For example,  I would have to purchase a .1% (trade fee) equivalent of ZRX.  I don't care what the value of ZRX is, as I am paying the market rate for ZRX that simply equates to .1% value of my trade.

- In block 4885890 I wrapped 0.8744 Ether in WETH.
- After my trade, I have 0.0240 WETH left.
- I lost 0.8505 WETH (ETH).

And: 

- I had 0 ZRX before the trade.
- My single order was split into 7 transactions.
- I now have 539.98 ZRX.

And:

- My limit order on DDEX was at a price of 0.00156.

Now if there were no fees, I would have received:

0.8505 / 0.00156 = 545.19 ZRX.

This means I paid fees worth of:

545.19 ZRX - 539.98 ZRX = 5.21 ZRX

Or about 10 dollars worth.

So far so good. I am just confused because every one of those 7 transactions is listed with a tx fee on etherscan of about 10 dollars. I take it DDEX is not charging any fees in ZRX at this point, but who paid those transaction fees? 

The other party in my trade? The (only mathematical) 5.21 ZRX that I didn't receive went were?

Vitalik has a really good blog post on governance and it's clear no one knows the answer right now. 

I'm concerned as time progresses, relayers will do more daily trading volume which will force them to hold large amounts of ZRX. For example, Olaf mentioned on Slack that he could see Coinbase being forced to hold large amounts of ZRX to participate in governance. 

That's probably what will happen but what about the people who are most qualified to vote? They'll probably have less of a stake compared to large relayers, advisors, hedge funds, and the 0x team themselves. 

Will it be possible to delegate our votes for other public figures in the future such as Olaf or Will or Amir as opposed to what relayers want to do? I'm curious what the team thinks and how they approach this. Clearly it's a new area of research that's going to be more of a pressing issue as time marches on.

[Amir]: ""Another unrelated thing that could be easily implemented for example would be a KYC whitelist. We’ve a lot of interests from institutions who are kind of looking into the decentralized exchange space and a lot of them can’t use decentralized exchanges because they can’t guarantee both sides of the trade have been KYC’d. So this ZEIP would allow for that really easily and they would have a KYC-only relayer or something like that.""

Sounds like ZEIP 18 will be implemented in V2 of 0x Protocol (mid-late Q2 release).

Who are the ""institutions?""

Does anyone know the standard or where it may be located? 

**I'm currently assuming this:**

exchangeContractAddress, 

maker, 

taker, 

makerTokenAddress, 

takerTokenAddress, 

feeRecipient, 

makerTokenAmount, 

takerTokenAmount, 

makerFee, 

takerFee, 

expirationUnixTimestampSec, 

salt



**And is this prefix standard for 0x relayers as well?** 

\x19Ethereum Signed Message:  


Also, a question about optional parameters.  It seems feeRecipient, taker, and expirationTimestampInSec are optional.  I've heard that you can simply fill them with 0x000000...000000 when signing if you do not want them specified.  What do you fill expirationTimestampInSec with if you do not want your order to expire?  Since it's a number, would you do max value?  Or zero?  


Edit:
So I'm experimenting with my signing logic against the 0x portal's output signature and here's what I'm finding:  If you don't specify an expiration, it ends up equaling 2524636800.  And feeRecipient and taker are indeed 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 when left blank.

I have a hard time coming up with examples where it's useful.

It seems like platforms implementing the protocol already have incentives to make improvements that users want. If a change is helpful for users, they'll prefer to use platforms that support the new protocol. So DEXs will add support for it, possibly coordinating among each other. Likely they'll support both protocols during the transition so the change doesn't need to happen at the same time.

If the holders of a ZRX want some protocol changes that users and exchanges don't want, then it seems obvious that users and exchanges will just ignore the ""upgrade."" Think about it: what if HTML was governed with a token, and holders of this token could vote to make changes to how HTML worked. Would that be helpful? 

Can anyone think of a concrete example where having protocol governance by ZRX holders would lead to a better outcome than just letting the protocol evolve the same way that non-crypto protocols evolve?

thanks to the feedback provided by the 0x community, we were able to improve [EasyTrade.io](https://easytrade.io) and launch our Beta version. 

For those who never heard about us, [EasyTrade.io](https://easytrade.io) works like Shapeshift but in a decentralized way.  It is built on top of 0x platform among other smart contracts.

&amp;nbsp;

The tool is aimed to help people who have a hard time using decentralized exchanges. With EasyTrade, you only have to set the amount of tokens that you want to buy or sell and submit the request to the smart contract. 

&amp;nbsp;

* No need to deposit or withdraw tokens.
* No need to deposit or withdraw ethers.
* No need to wrap ethers.
* No need to buy ZRX tokens to pay fees.

&amp;nbsp;

Here are some further notes to understand how it works:

&amp;nbsp;

**1)** EasyTrade is a tool that provides you with the best combinations of offline orders for the amount of tokens that you want to buy or sell. 

**2)** EasyTrade collects those offline orders from decentralized exchanges such as EtherDelta, Radar Relay, etc.

**3)** EasyTrade never holds your funds, not even the smart contract does.

**4)** You execute does orders by calling EasyTrade smart contract which then calls the exchange's smart contracts.

**5)** The rate limits you accept to exchange are enforced by the smart contract.

&amp;nbsp;

For those who want to learn more check our [FAQ](https://easytrade.io/faq) and our [SMART CONTRACT](https://easytrade.io/contract)

&amp;nbsp;

If you have more questions, some feedback or want to join our team, do not hesitate to contact us.

&amp;nbsp;

Have a nice day!

How does this change ZRX as a utility and the 0x ecosystem?","Paradex just went [live](https://twitter.com/ParadexIO/status/959157179671461888) and after the [fee post](https://medium.com/paradex/a-look-at-paradexs-fee-structure-and-implementation-860887097ef0) yesterday it has come to light and [confirmed by Paradex](https://www.reddit.com/r/0xProject/comments/7ubkwf/can_someone_eli5_paradexs_new_fee_structure_post/dtjy46t/) that they are NOT using ZRX for collecting fees like ERCDEX, IDT Exchange (formerly Kin Alpha) and Radar have in the past.

Instead since they play the taker on both orders they can just partial fill each order to collect fees from the tokens being traded an avoid using ZRX at all.

In a [past post](https://medium.com/paradex/choosing-paradexs-relayer-model-7190414c2aca) it is stated that they also cannot/will not share liquidity with other relayers.

How do these facts change ZRX usage as a utility in the 0x ecosystem? Will we see other relayers follow suit and remove ZRX as a fee token (like Ocean X and Amadeus)? If so, why build a relayer to not use ZRX and avoid liquidity sharing (one of the strongest features of 0x). Can governance be used to update the protocol and force relayers to use ZRX?

This means that matching relayers (or individuals on open orderbook relayers) could potentially hedge their operating costs against rising gas prices in the future. They don't have to directly use the token, so long as there is a market to sell it when they're going to use it.

3. Relayers are people who show the order book to the users and creates the interface for users as well as marketing
4. The reason y relayers would use 0x is so that they don't have to build their own protocols as well as not worrying about the liquidity of building their own exchange (every one who is a relayer will share the liquidity pool of 0x)
5. Market participants (traders / investors) will pay ZRX (0x's token) to these relayers when executing a trade in addition to paying for gas to the ethereum network
6. Relayers make money (in ZRX) from these transaction fees 
7. 0x makes money money presumably from the increase value of ZRX
8. The price of ZRX appreciates when more ppl trade using 0x relayers

My first assumption was that they were utilising the Etherscan API, however Etherscan have their own tracker, found at https://etherscan.io/dextracker , which appears to have more complete transactional data than others such as https://0xtracker.com/ and http://0xtrades.info/ .

All three of the above have inconsistent data, which leads me to believe that there is no current best practice.

In case you're unfamiliar, [ddex.io](https://ddex.io) is a 0x relayer which released open beta in January of 2018. Since then we've rolled out a bunch of new improvements to the site, and trading volume is starting to increase. I thought the 0x community would be interested in seeing some of the relayer progression here, as more features become ""standard"" for 0x relayers.    
Naturally we're still looking to improve upon a wide variety of things here (we have a lot more coming in the next few weeks too). We greatly appreciate any feedback or suggestions on our platform!    
*****    
# **Ledger Support**     
While viewing the trading interface on [ddex](https://ddex.io/trade/ZRX-ETH), you can select your current digital wallet (currently MetaMask or Ledger) in the top right hand corner of the screen. If you have both a MetaMask and a ledger account, you can switch between them there. Otherwise it will show a visual icon for which you have selected.    
*****    
# **UI/UX Improvements and Bottlenecks**    
Early on we found users were extremely confused with the whole concept of WETH wrapping. We still get users that don't realize they don't have to deposit anything into the exchange. Also, users were confusing their own order management areas with the order book. There's a strong learning curve for sure :)    
We added a few features to improve the natural flow of the website, increased understanding for when the user has to sign transactions in metamask, etc. Again, still room for improvement for sure, but I think it's starting to make more sense. User education is a massive part of the DEX game now, especially for 0x relayers now in the early stages.    
*****    
# **Feedback Appreciated!**    
If you have any interest in [checking out the exchange](https://ddex.io/trade), please let me know if you have any feedback/suggestions etc. We're always looking for ways to improve 0x relayer functionality for DDEX and the whole community.    
Cheers,

I want to contribute to the development of ETH and 0x in general, considering I am not a programmer.
I would like to run a node, so i will be able to help with the transactions.
While I did find some info on it, I don't see any hardware minimum specs needed (for example can I run it on a Raspberry Pi?).
I am also running a full parity node now in my office for the same purpose. In the meantime due to different issues i couldn't run it on RPI so I give up and use a full PC instead.

I understand the premise as a governance token, but it's also discussed as a fee to drive the DEX's, i.e. a utility token.  Utility tokens can be viewed as akin to carbon credits, wherein businesses need to hold an inventory of their relevant utility tokens or be able to rapidly (and reliably) exchange them for a more fiscally-relevant token.

An example of this could be with businesses that require KYC verification via Civic.  Let's say you're Intuit and switching to blockchain to verify your users, for every verification, you pay X amount of CVC to cover the processing of your transaction.  This means that Intuit, as a business, needs to either hold an inventory of CVC or be able to quickly transfer ETH into CVC with low risk (i.e. via a DEX).  Assuming some value to liquidity, it's a safe assumption that these inventories will be limited to necessity.

This provides a crucial and powerful use-case for 0x protocol, dovetailing with Will's discussion today of niche markets - say, a specific CVC-ETH pair DEX that allows for rapid and reliable trading of a utility token to/from a closer-to-currency token.  In this sense, 0x both provides enrichment of the echosystem and an opportunity for industry to offload/acquire utility tokens, all the while enabling itself a key growth opportunity (industry).

I think it's safe to accept this use-case as valuable, whether or not it is a target use-case for 0x is outside of my expertise to say, but from today's discussion it sounds like it might be.

If we accept this use-case as a target case, then a key goal for industry will be to use DEX's to trade value for utility tokens, and vice versa.  This leads to a unsavory conclusion however: if ZRX is needed as a fee to drive the DEX's, and utility-token users will want exchanges in order to trade utility tokens for value, 0x is effectively shooting itself in the foot by requiring its target market to hold an inventory of an additional utility token (ZRX).

So the question: How does 0x intend to reconcile the limitation that their token creates on their market opportunities?","","82luj9",NA,0,NA,"false",1522267125,"false","self","t5_3iw51","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/0xProject/comments/82luj9/zrx_as_a_utility_token_vs_market_opportunities/","","",NA,"","",0,0

Is it feasible that ZRX will facilitate tranasactions between any and all blockchains? Or is it specifically for ERC-20 only with limitations that will never allow trades for tokens on other blockchains?

In my opinion, if it’s limited to ERC-20 then the Achilles heal is that we’re assuming the ETH ecosystem will remain strong. If ETH projects migrate to EOS or something that hasn’t even been built yet becomes ‘the’ blockchain of choice, won’t the value of ZRX suffer tremendously?

I read the comments in multiple subreddits, but the picture is not clear to me. As someone who is not fluent in 0x, please help me understand the implications of the article.

1. Does this mean that once I enabled a certain token for trading on a certain wallet, then the 0x contract can pull any of that token from my wallet anytime? Even without me approving or signing a transaction?

2. What are the things that the multisig holders can and can't do (let's assume a case where they are all malevolent)? What do the users trust them with?

3. Why is there even a multisig/DAO? Why does this infrastructure need them? Isn't it supposed to be fully trustless? Isn't that the main selling point of 0x, or at least of the part that handles the actual token transfer?

 * Order Book strategy: Open Order Book
 * Cons:
     * User Interface:
         * I think that the UI is quite busy and has too much going on i.e lots of buttons, symbols, lines, and numbers that make the interface a bit confusing and intimidating.
 * Pros:
     * Functionality:
         * You can wrap your ETH within the trading module
         * Radar Relay has the most volume of any 0x relayer
         * Radar Relay has not implemented fees yet
     * User Interface:
         * The last price that a trade was successfully executed at is automatically entered as the price when making an order
         * You have the option of both a market order and a limit order
         * You can view all the trades in terms of a reference currency. This is really helpful for individuals like myself who do not think about prices in terms of ETH or ZRX

* **Paradex**:
 * Order Book Strategy: Matching Model
 * Cons: 
     * User Interface: 
         * I find the “Markets” tab to be very inconvenient to use when trying to browse through the different trading pairs
         * I also wasn’t sure where to start trading after their homepage loaded
     * Functionality:
         * You can’t wrap ETH within their trading module. 
         * Paradex expects you to manually enter the price, instead of automatically calculating it based on the most recent filled order
         * You can only trade up to 50 ETH worth of value in any one trade
         * They have fees
     * Pros: 
         * User Interface:
         * I found Paradex’s user interface to be the best of the three relayers I traded on. It wasn’t cluttered, overwhelming, or intimidating to use.
         * When you first sign into Paradex, you see a welcome message that explains the steps that are required to trade on the platform
         * The “Account” page provides a nice overview of all the tokens you have unlocked for trading, your outstanding orders, and filled orders.

* **DDEX**:
 * Order Book Strategy: Matching Model	
 * Cons:
     * User Interface:
         * It is very difficult to scroll through the different trading pairs that DDEX supports
         * When you want to wrap your ETH, a popup window appears. This makes it more difficult to view your balances of WETH and ETH
         * DDEX doesn’t differentiate between WETH and ETH on their prices. Their representation of ETH is actually WETH, which becomes confusing when switching between their trading module and Metamask
     * Functionality:
         * They have fees
         * Max trade size of 50 ETH
 * Pros:
     * User Interface:
         * After getting used to their wrapping window, I liked the scroll bar that they provide
         * You can choose an amount of a token for an order based on a percentage of the WETH you hold
     * Functionality:
         * Price is automatically calculated when you go to make an order
         * Individuals can wrap ETH within their trading module

**Conclusions**: Apart from the busy user interface, I found Radar Relay to have the best functionality of three relayers I tested. I'm interested to hear other people's thoughts

1. I understand that ZRX is not a platform protocol in the sense of other projects like Ethereum, NEO, EOS, etc. but is it possible to create DAPPs on the protocol that would create future airdrop possibilities?

2. Since ZRX is a governance token, is it technically possible to build in the ability for holders to stake their own tokens with a relayer in order to increase the relayer's governance influence and in return receive a relative % of the relayer fees generated?

3. Any other technical use cases around that would create additional or passive income opportunities for token holders?

I've been searching on 0x protocol and trying understand it. 
But I've some dark points I cannot figure out ... 

I don't get the difference between smart-contract used in 0x and atomic swap ones. 

Is the difference that 0x smart contract are ethereum based, and can only work using ERC-20 tokens and atomic swap smart-contracts are ones that allow use to use any token from any chain ? 

So is the difference only : Ethereum Smart contract and non Etherem smart contract ?

You’re on my [analytic project](https://coinsocialstory.com/#utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=0x%20checking) I’ve been working on in my spare time for the last few months.

Here I make ratings of crypto-currency by different criteria, such as price, social, development and network(which is coming soon). 

Every currency has its own page(for example, [this](https://coinsocialstory.com/0x#utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=0x%20personal) is yours)

And, for if I want to put the history of each coin in it, here I might need your help

If you can tell me something about the history of 0x, I would very appreciate that.

You can write me here or on my email address [coinsocialstory@gmail.com](mailto:coinsocialstory@gmail.com).

And also I really want to hear some feedback from you about the project itself because there is still a lot of work to do :)

Your opinion is always welcome and I can’t wait to see any advice and suggestions!⚡️",NA,"8rzsfa",NA,0,NA,"false",1536399469,"false","self","t5_3iw51","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/0xProject/comments/8rzsfa/historical_data_is_needed/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

In fact, unless there's long-term correlation between 0x network utility and token value, tokens are only useful as a tool of speculation.

As trade volume &amp; depth increase (network utility), so should the value of the 0x token. Such a correlation would encourage long-term investment, not short term speculation.

Governance could be that correlating force driving token value as network utility increases. But I think it’s fair to ask how and why governance will drive token value.

Firstly, the distribution of voting tokens matters in a governance system. If [a few aligned parties](https://blog.0xproject.com/announcing-the-0x-token-zrx-launch-d4c097d893c7) control &gt; 50&amp;#37; of the voting tokens, it’s reasonable to assume no “activist token-holder” proposals could ever pass. In that case you have to question the point of governance to begin with.

If voting power is obtainable by interested parties, it’s fair to ask what proposals they might want to vote on.

One obvious answer to this question is a proposal to ensure correlation between 0x network utility and ZRX token price. Some proposals would be rent-seeking in nature (which I oppose).

I’d argue the strongest non-rent-seeking way of correlating token value to network value is to require trading fees to be charged in the ZRX token.

Burn schemes / velocity sinks are rent-seeking and should be avoided. I also worry they’d be amongst the first schemes proposed under a governance system.

Right now the value of the ZRX token has almost no correlation to the success of the network. That should be the first priority of governance.

Connecting token value to network utility is so important that I'd argue it's preferable to ship that change before governance, especially given how concentrated voting power is amongst a few parties.

This would set precedence for how value should accrue to token holders going forward, and discourage rent-seeking activists. Again, I think the fairest way to do that is by requiring that fees are charged in ZRX, not ETH or another token.",NA,"8uvtk2",NA,0,NA,"false",1536461899,"false","self","t5_3iw51","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/0xProject/comments/8uvtk2/thoughts_on_token_value_and_governance/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

For awhile now I've been writing about coins that have caught my eye. When it comes to altcoins, you have to be so careful - for every truly promising one, there are ten useless pieces of garbage. Many people don't even know altcoins exist at all!

Basically, my goal is to give people a very high level picture of coins I've found interesting enough to get ahold of. When it comes to ZRX, I'm not going to lie - I first heard of this token from John McAfee when he said it would be worth $2.90 by August. Now, I have no idea if he's right on this, but that aspect isn't very important to me anyway; 0x itself is interesting to me primarily because I find decentralized exchanges to be an important emerging technology. Most importantly, 0x already has a functioning platform - this is always a very good sign in a world where so many altcoins are basically smoke and mirrors.

So, I've written this article/review - I know that I'm not the first one to write about this and I'm sure I won't be the last, but I'd love it if you guys could take a look. My goal is to educate people about cryptocurrencies in a quick and fun way, then give them the tools and information they need to get ahold of some. I know better than anyone that researching coins takes time, and if I can save people a little of this time then I'm doing my job. I also want to give people an idea of how to protect their investment - including how to safely hold their ZRX tokens in a wallet. Thanks for reading, and feel free to take a look at [my page](https://rosecrypto.com/ZRX-Guide) for the full article.",NA,"8r7czs",NA,0,NA,"false",1536378614,"false","self","t5_3iw51","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/0xProject/comments/8r7czs/my_take_on_0x/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

* create the front\-end, use 0x protocol for the smart contract part and create a relayer and be part of the 0x DEXs ecosystem and share their orderbook
* create the front\-end and use Airswap protocol for the smart contract part
* create my own front end, my own smart contracts and build everything on top of the OMG DEX

right?

Can I use the 0X protocol AND build everything on top of the OMG DEX?

Is the ZRX token only required if we need to use relayers to fulfill an order? Can a DEX use 0x internally and fulfill orders internally throught its users or run it's own relayer and avoid the need for the token.  
  
Of course when I am trying to fulfill orders from other DEX's we can introduce the concept of the ZRX token and transact using it for relayer fees.

We would like to introduce our Relayer project [**Weswap.io.**](https://www.weswap.io)

Weswap is an instant peer-to-peer token exchange where users can buy and sell Ethereum tokens in a decentralized manner. We have just published our [**introduction article**](https://medium.com/weswap/introducing-weswap-the-most-simple-decentralized-exchange-for-ethereum-based-tokens-a25a97e8fd59), where you can learn more about our Relayer concept and what we aim to achieve.

We are looking forward to hearing your feedbacks! Please, do not hesitate to join our mailing list and social media channels to stay up to date with our development and get in touch with us!

Thank you for your time!

I think this post touches a point that is quietly one of the biggest reasons the 0x Network has grown as fast as it has--that it's friction is kept to an absolute minimum. Turns out that building free, public infrastructure that anyone can buidl on is a really powerful thing!

##Getting Started  
  
* * *  
  
**Who are we as a community?**  
  
We're a mission and values driven community united around changing financial architecture.  
     
- Vision: We envision a world in which all forms of value are tokenized on public blockchains.  
  
- 0x Mission: Create a tokenized world where all value can flow freely.  
  
-  0x Core Values: Do the Right Thing, Consistently Ship, and Focus on Long-Term Impact  
  
- Read more about our identity here:[The 0x Mission and Values](https://blog.0xproject.com/the-0x-mission-and-values-181a58706f9f) (article)   

  &amp;nbsp;    



  
**What is 0x?**  
  
0x is an open protocol that facilitates peer-to-peer exchange of digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain. 0x provides base layer exchange infrastructure that developers can build on top of for free.  
  
- [Beginner’s Guide to 0x](https://blog.0xproject.com/a-beginners-guide-to-0x-81d30298a5e0) (article)   
- [Introduction by Co-founder Will Warren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVT36N8wUIo) (video)   
- [Whitepaper](https://0xproject.com/pdfs/0x_white_paper.pdf) (pdf)   

  &amp;nbsp;    



  
**Why does 0x matter?**  
  
The 0x protocol matters because decentralized exchange technology matters for the entire blockchain ecosystem.   
  
- [Why Decentralized Exchange Protocols Matter](https://medium.com/@FEhrsam/why-decentralized-exchange-protocols-matter-58fb5e08b320) (article)  

  &amp;nbsp;    


 
    
Instead of creating a decentralized exchange themselves, the 0x team created a platform which allows any developer to build on top of cutting-edge decentralized exchange (DEX) technology. The 0x protocol is a platform for other developers to build on.  
  
- [The Role of the 0x Core Team in the 0x Ecosystem](https://blog.0xproject.com/the-role-of-the-0x-core-team-in-the-0x-ecosystem-2d8b50354166) (article)   
- [What can be built on 0x?](https://blog.0xproject.com/18-ideas-for-0x-relayers-in-2018-80a1498b955f) (article)   

  &amp;nbsp;    

  
    
0x lowers the barrier to entry for developers to use DEX technology, and allows decentralized exchanges built on 0x, called Relayers, a choice to share liquidity with the entire 0x ecosystem. 0x’s protocol infrastructure prioritizes:  
  
- **Access for everyone in the world**  
- **Non-custodial trades:** You remain in control of your funds at all times   
- **Low friction:** No signup required, just start trading   
- **Orderbook liquidity:** Each DEX can share liquidity with the entire ecosystem   
- **No barriers to listing assets to trade:** The protocol supports broad asset classes   
- **Open source, audited smart contracts:** You don’t have to trust anyone
 
 &amp;nbsp;    

   
    
One last important detail about 0x is that it is built to be public infrastructure. What that means is that in the short term, the 0x core team is in control of upgrades to the protocol, but in the long term, 0x’s protocol will transition to community governance.

Monica, Director of Community over at The Ocean, here. It's been a super busy and exciting time for our team over the past month. Our DEX is officially launching on July 31st!

In preparation for worldwide trading, we'll be hosting a brief beta period on MainNet starting later this week. We invite all fans of the 0x Project to join us in testing the waters. :)

As all trades will be live (ZRX, REQ, BAT, and more tokens), we will require users to go through KYC/AML sign up before receiving a beta invite. Sorry in advance for the inconvenience!

Our main goals during this period will be:

* To gather data to better inform our UI/UX decisions and roadmap
* To adjust performance for maximum smooth-sailing
* To lay down the procedure and benchmarks for communicating with you

Thank you for being so awesome.

&amp;nbsp;



The 0x team has realized recently that not having a wikipedia page can stand in the way of new user discovery and trust. We would love to solve that and we need your help. Wikipedia articles are not built to be written by 1 person, but rather communities of people who know a subject well. If you would like to help, here are a few things we need:

1. Start commenting on changes to this doc. Add sentences, add paragraphs, add proper sources. Please help how you can! Remember that we want this to be as non-bias as possible. It is ok to point out good &amp; bad things, and things that are promised, but not yet done.  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lZB6SriWpCNNzgIn7DHYIPco6hV7lUyuMuQkKT-XwOE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lZB6SriWpCNNzgIn7DHYIPco6hV7lUyuMuQkKT-XwOE/edit?usp=sharing)
2. If you are a regular wikipedia contributor, please DM me.
3. If you are interested in helping the world learn about decentralized cryptocurrency exchange, there is a big opportunity as Wikipedia doesn't have an article. They have an article on [cryptocurrency exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange), but it doesn't even have a section for centralized vs. decentralized. Spreading the word about this on Reddit/social media and getting this changed will be a small step in the right direction.

Although leverj isn't on mainnet yet, they've already released their token and staking contract. The way it basically works is that to trade on the exchange, you pay in FEE tokens, much like we pay ZRX on relays, except FEE tokens are generated by staking LEV tokens.

I can see a relay implementing a similar structure, where they release their own token, RADARTOKEN for example, representing their relay (maybe as a DAO representing voting rights for that individual relay?) and those tokens would be sent to a staking contract, and holders staking said token would be distributed zrx tokens collected in fees by the relay.

The relay could sell their tokens on their relay for some quick income to cover expenses/upgrades/etc and keep a portion for themselves so that they can keep collecting zrx fees off from relays, and to be able to sell in the future to fund future projects. They could even get creative and start to buy back their token using a portoin of the zrx fees generated when volume and/or price starts to drop.",NA,"96lri3",NA,0,NA,"false",1536743565,"false","self","t5_3iw51","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/0xProject/comments/96lri3/communitys_thoughts_on_leverjs_tokenfeestaking/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

Here are my thoughts:

&amp;#x200B;

Garbage collection can be used to subsidize certain parties or functionality, by freeing up data and allowing functions to have a net negative gas fee. Pseudocode example:

&amp;#x200B;

`free(Order[] orders) {`

`order for each orders`

`require(order.expiresAt &amp;lt; now)`

`delete transactions [keccak(order)]`

`}`

Profit: 9000 gas per order.

&amp;#x200B;

For 0x it might be interesting to allow the relayer to call free. The average fee per executed order is around 90000 gas. Gas collection Offers a 10% discount as a subsidy for relayers.

Back in January we launched DDEX - a matching mode 0x relayer. 20,000+ transactions later, we’ve learned a ton about decentralized exchanges, and talked with hundreds of different blockchain projects about their goals and challenges. Oftentimes it became apparent that listing on an exchange was actually overkill - a subset of these projects simply wanted an easy way for their communities to buy or sell their tokens. 


In May, the 0x team introduced [forwarding contracts](https://forum.0xproject.com/t/forwarding-contract-overview/113), a lightweight mechanism which abstracts away the concept of WETH and allowances. We realized that this provided the type of simplicity many projects were looking for! So we decided to build on top of the excellent foundational work of the 0x forwarding contract to create a trade widget that can be directly embedded into webpages and dApps, backed by Hydro/DDEX liquidity.


We performed customer interviews with dApps and token projects, and got a lot of feedback. The most popular request was an **“out of the box” liquidity solution which “just works”.** Using our experience from running a relayer, we are able to help projects figure out liquidity solutions, what types of spreads they can support, fees they want to use, etc. 


Today we are launching a super early alpha version of [Hydro Swap Widget](https://swap.hydroprotocol.io/), an embeddable trade widget that anyone can integrate into their webpage or dApp in minutes. **We would absolutely love some feedback!** Also happy to answer any general questions or elaborate on all of this. This version of the widget can be used either on ropsten (Ethereum testnet) or main net . The code has completed [auditing from SECBIT](https://github.com/HydroProtocol/swap-contract). 


We are currently working with several early adopters to deploy live versions of the widget within the next couple of weeks. 


Most of our effort went into creating the UI design and building the liquidity system. The HydroSwap system offers 3 types of built in liquidity options for developers: constant, algorithmic, and adaptive (based on existing exchange listings). We hope to make it easy for developers to implement the liquidity solution of their choice, and quickly test and iterate to find what works best for them.

 
For Settlement, the Hydro Swap Widget relies on 0x protocol to do most of the heavy lifting. The Hydro Swap Widget works with v1.0 of 0x today, but we’ve made sure everything is forward compatible with the soon to be released 2.0 version. **Thanks again to the 0x team and community for making this all possible.**    


*PS - If you are part of a blockchain project that would like to be one of the first to integrate, please reach out to me and I’ll help you get started. We are making this completely free for early adopters.*",NA,"9bl9yi",NA,0,NA,"false",1536828906,"false","self","t5_3iw51","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/0xProject/comments/9bl9yi/announcing_hydro_swap_a_0x_based_swap_widget_for/",NA,"","false","","",0,1

Let me know if you folks like this kind of thing. Will consider doing another design if there's enough interest. Hope you enjoy!

According to Coinsmarketcap, current circulating supply is 536,951,659 ZRX.
Adding up the wallets that belong to 0x according to Etherscan:
https://etherscan.io/address/0x606af0bd4501855914b50e2672c5926b896737ef
https://etherscan.io/address/0x206376e8940e42538781cd94ef024df3c1e0fd43
https://etherscan.io/address/0xdb63d40c033d35e79cdbb21430f0fe10e9d97303
It adds up to 425382236. 
1,000,000,000 - 425,382,236 = 574,617,764
Meaning that 37,666,105 ZRX is still missing. That sum can be found in wallet: https://etherscan.io/address/0xead6be34ce315940264519f250d8160f369fa5cd

My question is to whom the this wallet (0xead6be34ce315940264519f250d8160f369fa5cd) belongs to if its tokens are discluded from circulating supply. It should belong to the team but it's not flaged.

Having to explain to users why they need to have ZRX, what ZRX is, and how much of it they would need is enough of an uphill battle that it will cause users to abandon attempting a trade.  Additionally, for relayers to set a fee as a percentage means that we have to start using exchange rates which can be very unreliable.

In my opinion the role of ZRX tokens for governance will be more than enough to bolster its price since projects (exchanges and core blockchain dev teams) will want to have some influence on the decentralized exchange platform's roadmap (especially atomic swaps, etc).  

I doubt setting the makerFee and takerFee to be denominated in their respective tokens would impact gas fees very much. For some of us app developer already offering centralized exchange we could even hide the fact that the exchange occurring is decentralized (no surprises for our users). Perhaps most importantly the price of the ZRX token will not perform well in the long-term if the usability of its protocol is hampered by the fees being denominated in ZRX. 

I would love to hear what the community, both 0x devs and non-0x devs, has to say about the issue so that we can figure out what would be best for the ecosystem.

My name is George-Phillip, I live in the Lower Haight and I am very interested in joining the 0x team as I have been following this project since its birth. With that said, I am quite hesitant / intimidated as my professional/medical background consists of Specialty Pharmacy Manager. I have no engineering or developer background but have been blessed with fast learning and hard work ethic. If there are any moderators/admins reading this, what would you suggest or recommend? Are there any 0x meetups in San Francisco scheduled for this month? I look forward to your response and I hope you have a wonderful day.

[Fetch](https://fetchtrading.com) is a desktop app that makes it simple to trade tokens while retaining sole ownership of your keys. Fetch finds the best price across exchanges and execute trades with one click, including DEX's, anonymous exchanges and 0x Relayers! You'll see real-time prices on exchanges and can trade easily without having to learn the tricky details of each exchange's UI. Fetch takes care of WETH or any of the other nuances of a specific exchange or protocol.  


How you can participate now:

* We're releasing 0x support with our beta in September. We'd love to hear any feedback and which Relayers you want to see supported first. 
* [Read more](https://medium.com/fetch-trading/fetch-alpha-release-83c5122c2bfb) about the alpha. The post includes a quick demo to show you what we mean by simple.
* [Signup for the beta](http://www.fetchtrading.com/?signup=fetch-alpha-release&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=fetch-alpha-release) and be one of the first to experience Fetch for yourself.  


We're excited to contribute more to the 0x community. We'll make it simple for everybody to trade across Relayers (and non-0x exchanges). We'll also be evaluating how to release portions of what we're building to help other teams easily support 0x in their apps.

I won't shill our podcast too much, but you can google it if you're interested. 

Here are the questions I've come up with in my research. I'm going to continue digging, but once I get to this point where the community is my best source, Google is failing me and I'm only running into moonboys on Youtube talking about wicks. 

* The whitepaper mentions a DAO. The last update that I could find that gives information the development of the DAO is from May found [here](https://blog.0xproject.com/governance-in-0x-protocol-86779ae5809e) . It looks like based on that plan that their DAO isn't going to be ready until 2020? Is that accurate?
* Currently the funds are controlled by a ""multisig"" wallet as referenced in the whitepaper - which entities, or which people, control this multisig wallet?  
* Are there safeguards in place if the team that controls the multisig wallet does something that the community disagrees with? 

They seem to be the point of contention where the community kinda breaks down. My perception is that the 0x dev team controls the multisig wallet, and the best the community could do if they did something that wasn't popular was be on top of it and get their orders canceled. I'm having some trouble marrying this with the true ""Decentralized Exchange"" value proposition, but as usual I'm certain I'm missing something. 

I would also love to have someone from the team on the show if they happen to lurk this sub. ",NA,"9avi3l",NA,0,NA,"false",1536816777,"false","self","t5_3iw51","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/0xProject/comments/9avi3l/brent_here_from_cryptobasic_podcast_were_doing_an/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

I am trying to build a relayer and trying to get liquidity from other relayers. As I see, every order that I get, taker is not  NULL\_ADDRESS, but some other address. Is user able to fill that order despite it is not null? Am I missing something?

&amp;#x200B;

From documentation:

 The 

    NULL_ADDRESS

is used for the 

    taker

field since in our case we do not care who the taker will be and using 

    NULL_ADDRESS

will allow anyone to fill our order.

Could a 0x relayer be weaved into a loom sidechain? Rationale: Creating a bridge between that sidechain and the main chain through an off chain market place for NFTs

Could a 0x relayer (also for NFTs) be used in conjunction with the Enjin protocol to provide their multiverse with an open marketplace?

At the moment, the value proposition for ZRX is somewhat esoteric. It’s theoretically used as a governance mechanism for avoiding contentious forks. If this is indeed valuable in the sense that it captures value, it’s certainly difficult to value in the sense of determining a number of satoshis that a ZRX token is worth. It’s possible that ZRX ends up not being very valuable, but that relayers built atop the 0x protocol become widely used and make a lot of money. However, it’s also possible that the 0x team (which in my estimation is one of the absolute best in the industry) pivots to a more value-accretive model for the token. They’ve expressed their unwillingness to do this in a way that harms the usefulness of the protocol itself, which makes sense because doing that would probably just result in relayers unceremoniously forking the token out. That said, there may be a way to have the ZRX token accrue value in a way that relayers are amenable to, and if there is, the 0x team will figure out it.""",NA,"9gt7tu",NA,0,NA,"false",1540139632,"false","self","t5_3iw51",NA,"","","false","true",NA,"/r/0xProject/comments/9gt7tu/proof_of_work_37_on_zrx_token_value_proposition/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

As most of you know, [**0x v2.0 is live**](https://blog.0xproject.com/0x-protocol-v2-0-is-live-183aac180149)! 

Thanks to all the [relayers, dApp builders, market makers and others who have contributed so far and helped make 0x what it is today](https://imgur.com/uPx1JEa.gifv). I think it's safe for me to say that everyone on the team is very excited to see what we can all do together next. 

To that end, the core team is having an AMA to answer any questions you might have! Post your questions in the comments below starting now, and 0x CEO Will Warren (/u/willwarren89) + other members of the team will be in this thread tomorrow, **September 26th @ 10 AM PT (5 PM UTC)** to start answering. Look forward to hearing from you!
