So here's how I see it now: 

* People create transactions, and sign them with their private key. 
* Transactions all enter a giant pool
* Miners pick transactions and try to create a block that fits. To do so they need to solve a puzzle. In the case of Bitcoin they need to find an input that lies below a certain threshold when hashed twice by SHA-256. 
* When a miner creates a valid block, it's added to the chain, and he receives a reward. 
* The chain where most people are working on will grow the quickest. Since the longest chain counts as the ""official"" chain, an attacker would require more than 50% of the total compute power to ""overtake"" the official chain. 

Now the questions are mainly: what about everything that doesn't make the ""official"" blockchain? Illegal transactions: 

* What about invalid transactions (signature fail)? When are they checked, before or after they enter the pool? Do miners detect it when trying to forge a block?
* What about double spendings? They get in the pool, right? When are they detected? Can a miner get stuck trying to find a block for illegal transactions? 
* How are illegal transactions discarded? How do they disappear from the pool? 
* How is the pool even distributed to miners?",NA,"7mauys",NA,0,NA,"false",1515380177,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/7mauys/final_questions_about_pow_consensus/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

some excerpts:

&gt;it can take up to three days—T3—for stock trades to change hands via clearing houses such as the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC). It’s a process known as ‘settlement lag.’ Every hour before settlement happens, when a trade precariously hangs between sale and purchase, increases the risk that the trade won’t go through. Obviously, it’s in the banks’ interest to close that lag time as much as possible.



&gt;And that is why most major players in the financial industry are busy investing significant resources into blockchain solutions. They have to embrace this new paradigm to ensure it works for, not against, them.



&gt;More than forty banks have a stake in a consortium called R3CEV to come up with shared standards for blockchains. 



&gt;From Buterin to Hearn, it seems that everyone, however different their motives, is in a race to create something like the original Satoshi blockchain, only better. For many, it’s the biggest game in town.



&gt;What’s not in doubt is that, as the cost of trust plummets because of new technology, the third parties currently paid to facilitate our trust—be they agents, referees, watchdogs or custodians—will increasingly have to prove their value if they don’t want to be supplanted by an ‘immutable’ ledger.",NA,"7n8kvv",NA,0,NA,"false",1515398097,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/7n8kvv/wired_blockchain_article_describing_the_banks/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,1

The censorship and vitriol that has festered on r/bitcoin is disgusting. And an affront to what the internet, and legitimate debate are supposed to be. And r/btc and bitcointalk are only slightly better in terms of discourse.

Those that aren't toxic are typically little more than an echo chamber of fan boys. I'd like a real discussion on the biggest problem facing crypto right now, the scaling issues with Bitcoin.

For better or worse, Bitcoin is what is dragging crypto into the main stream (honorable mention to ETH). Unfortunately, all the noobies entering the space are finding a Bitcoin, in the grips of a civil war, that has become completely unusable due to high fees and an ever growing mempool. Bitcoin is facing an existential threat in the form of Bitcoin Cash that didn't exist just 6 short months ago.

Core developers claim, Jihan and Roger are evil masterminds behind a massive, unrelenting, coordinated attack to destroy bitcoin. They claim big blocks are to be avoided at all costs as they will centralize power among the miners who are only interested in on chain scaling to protect their own profit margins. Under core's watch, Bitcoin has ceased to be the world changing tech it once was, and has instead become possibly among the world's most expensive and inconvenient way to exchange value. They claim this is part of the coordinated attack as attackers spam the mempool. In the meantime they've used classic ""move the posts"" techniques such as insisting that Bitcoin is a store of value, and was never a currency, and have even suggested things as ridiculous as using LTC to transmit value instead as a work around while we wait for scaling solutions that never come.

Jihan and Roger claim they are preserving Satoshi's true vision. Gavin Andresen agrees. They claim blocks are being kept artificially low to push the network towards tier 2 solutions which would ultimately benefit Blockstream. They accuse the several core developers who happened to be employed by Blockstream of conflict of interest. They claim lightning network will centralize power among the lightning nodes. They claim core is attempting a hostile takeover of bitcoin. Jihan and Roger were also among the biggest Bitcoin holders in the world. They benefited from the ""free money"" of the fork more than anyone, and have a vested interest worth multi millions if not billions to ensure Bitcoin Cash exists. But most likely, don't want to see their BTC investment fall too 0 either. (Roger claims to have dumped all his BTC, I don't buy it). It's also true that the updates in core would have eliminated asic boost, possibly one of the biggest factors in making Jihan such a powerful figure in the world of BTC. They also use shady manipulative tactics to shape public opinion and allegedly have many sock puppet accounts and trolls at their disposal.

Both arguments have merit. Come poke holes in them and let's get to the truth.

Recently there was a controversy about Edward Snowden stating that he preferred ZCash over Monero because they have zero knowledge proofs. Correct me if I'm wrong, but as far as I understood it goes as follows:

The chance to be the issuer of a ring transaction with ringsize n is 1/n. That means there is a slight chance for detection, even though it offers plausible deniability.

With zero knowledge proofs however, there would be absolutely no chance to detect who is the issuer of the transaction. This means - if implemented right - that they are superior to ring transactions.

ZCash as it currently exists (Trusted setup, Dev tax, optional privacy) is a bad coin IMO. However, if there was a clone with forced anonymity on every transaction and no dev tax, I could see it overtake Monero

To get to the point: Is anything of the stuff I thought about wrong? Additionaly: Is there already such a Zcash clone?

I've been trying to wrap my head around XRP's burn rate aspect, and found [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ripple/comments/672a6t/ripple_burn_rate/) (excerpt below):

&gt; What I found interesting on this page and hope if someone may have clarity is the burn rate of xrp. This seems important as it will reduce the supply over time, in turn increasing the price per xrp.

&gt; Does anyone know the rate of burn of xrp per transaction?

&gt; A rough calculation indicates 5m xrp have been burnt to date. Assuming this is a linear function (which I am sure it is not) and taking xrp's start date as 2012. There is an average burn rate of 2750 xrps per day. With a current trade volume of $7.5m for the previous 24hours, this would provide an estimated burn rate of 0.000362175 xrp per transaction. A similar calculation could be applied to the number of ledgers or accounts.

&gt; Therefore, at the current rate ripple will last 99,630 years. Which brings me to my next question.

&gt; Could there the number of xrps reach zero?

&gt; Is the rate of burn the same for a transaction of 1xrp or 1m xrp?

&gt; Obviously, as transactions increase over time more and more xrp will be burnt per day. Calculating this burn rate could give an idea of future price based on uptake and daily volume of transactions.

&gt; Also, would the burn rate be linear (probably not) or follow some sort of -ln function? Surely the amount of xrp burnt would have to decrease over time otherwise it may reach zero.

&gt; It appears to be a quality often overlooked by others outside the community who complain about the huge number of xrp in existence and may explain why ripple ""the company"" feels the need to hold so many internally.

So this data is obviously a bit outdated, but similar questions come to mind for me as-well:

1. If ripple burns itself over time, does the rate increase or decrease? Can we reach 0 XRP's?
2. Eventually as it gets more adoption, will fees increase? Will the burn rate be enough?
3. What *is* the exact burn rate currently? How much has been burned so far?

 I do love the concept that it protects us from network spam attacks, I guess I'm just having trouble gasping how XRP is sustainable, or what these numbers look like.

Any insight would be great - thanks!

My question is this, ""How are any of these coins anonymous?"" 
There is always a point of sale where, in order to actually utilize your currency, you need to stop being anonymous. Even if your identity is not tied to the card (how else are you paying with crypto besides a card) there will be a record of that card being used at a point of sale. Criminals have been caught for a long time by using credit cards that they stole from others. I think Silk road #1 and #2 are great examples of how bitcoin did not save anyone involved in those fiascoes. The government had loads of electronic data that they used in court. It was all pretty much open and shut. They literally said that the way the caught illegal vendors was to simply monitor the wallets and then arrest the person when they cashed out and identified themselves. 

Another example would be buying crypto. You need a credit/debit card in order to buy any of these coins and even if a criminal stole a card and used that card to buy crypto all the transactions are recorded in perpetuity and at some point the criminal would have to expose themselves if they wanted to spend the coins they stole. So while it might be possible to steal coins, spending them without getting caught is a different story.

* USDT  - backed with USD reserves (or are they?)

So I would be grateful if people can point me in the direction of any other stablecoin out there - preferably on that is is in use on a lot of exchanges.

Also, given the inherent issues in trying to peg a coin to a FIAT - is the approach by USDT the only guaranteed way to do it? (do they have the USD notwithstanding).

I'm very new to cryptocurrency and this subreddit. I'm currently 17 yrs old, and turning 18 in a few weeks, and I want to start investing in cryptocurrency when I come of legal age to start doing so.

So to prepare for this I am reading up on cryptocurrencies via books, articles, this subreddit and also watching YouTube videos. I know you can start investing with minimal knowledge about how this technology actually works, but I find it interesting and I mainly want to invest for fun and to get a feel for crypto, more so than making alot of money.

NOTE: I will only invest as much as I am willing to lose, so don't worry about that.

So because I want to learn I downloaded the original bitcoin whitepaper and printed it and just finished reading it and made notes and stuff. There are still a couple of sentances I don't understand, and I am sure you can help me understand better.

1. I don't understand the meaning of this. Taken from chapter 6: Incentive on transaction fees. ""If the output value of a transaction is less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the inventive value of the block containing the transaction. Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free.""

2. What are multi-input transactions? Taken from chapter 10: privacy.

3. I dont understand anything about chapter 9: Combining and splitting value. Can someone maybe ELI5 or make a summarized version?

I was wondering what the methodology behind that was, so I did some digging but couldn't find the original paper.

What I did find was quotes from the paper on Zero Hedge (https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-12-02/jpmorgan-has-some-bad-news-bitcoin-bears)

&gt;Here is the bank's punchline: ""The net flow into cryptocurrencies is very much a function of coin creation which is controlled by computer algorithms and in the case of bitcoin is diminishing over time. Figure 6 shows the net amount of money 
 invested every year since 2009. The cumulative amount has totaled around $6bn since 2009, well below the current market cap of $300bn."" For Ethereum, the number is just as stark: with a market cap of $45 billion, net inflows have been under $2 billion in the past two years. This is shown in the chart below:""

So the analyst has calculated the net inflow as being the sum of  (average price of a coin) x (increase in coin circulation)

From my perspective, this is not really ""net inflows"" - that's the 'value' of coins produced. Net Inflows to me implies the amount of FIAT deposited on exchanges and traded for crypto? Now I get that the real ""net inflow"" is not really possible to calculate so he approximated, but the calculation doesn't seem to hold up to even the simplest scrutiny? By their logic, if I put $15b onto coinbase and bought up a whole bunch of coins the ""net inflow"" would be unchanged at $6b...

Any thoughts and does anyone have a link to the paper?

And we stopped for a while to discuss whether the whitepaper's language should be technical or not.

Because on one hand, we want people to understand the blockchain and its applications (because when people don't understand something they are scared of it). Maybe there should be a section which is more technical (marked as 'technical details/ for devs/etc' and then sections on applications - because people need to understand what are the benefits for them or for the society (I, myself, am not technical, don't know how many things in the world work but I use them and see their benefits because they have good interfaces). Explaining what a certain project does with the blockchain technology in plain language would enable non-technical to understand more [and would be a good practice for the projects themselves to say in one line what they do and why ;)].

On the other hand, it might be that projects use technical and industry-specific (e.g. financial) jargon to naturally sift their audience and only have as their supporters (or investors) people who already have a certain level of knowledge of both the blockchain and the industry.

Buying games online is easy. However, Steam takes 30% of every sale. They almost have a monopoly on game sales, which isn't great for developers. And you can't resell games in your collection that you don't want any more. That's not good for consumers.

What if we put keys for PC games on a blockchain?

Think about it. The game developer or publisher could release a batch of keys. There would be no question of their authenticity because they could be traced back to the issuer.

Instead of Steam taking 30%, marketplaces could be formed which take a much smaller cut.

Currently, when you activate a game, it's locked to your account forever. With a blockchain solution, you could resell that key back onto the market, recouping part of your cost and letting someone else get it for a discount.

This could actually be good for developers if we build into the smart contract a mechanism where they get a percentage of every sale on the secondary market.

I know that to date blockchain has mainly been deployed for financial and supply chain solutions with some preliminary work in healthcare (biggest ventures in Asia like AI Doctor). 

But I wanted to open up the discussion. What would need to happen for blockchain to be deployed and adopted more widely?

Some thoughts on current barriers: 

No general consenus on how EHRs should be formated

HIPAA (privacy laws on what can be shared, how and by whom)

Richness and specific nature of individual medical cases may be too difficult to capture in a decentralized sharable format

Legacy systems and reliance of paper charts / prescriptions

Difficulity in engaging largest consumer of healthcare (older people) in technology

I’m tired of reading about bubbles, crashes, pump and dumps - I don’t invest in crypto to buy a Lambo in 3 days (also because Lambo is so 1995). I think that we can do better than that, like buy Saab900. Don't worry it's a joke, I own a bike. Anyway, 

I know that there are a lot of tools and pages for traders with a massive amount of different charts, predictions and wishful-thinking-graphs. But there is also another group of people interested in crypto - investors, people who invest money slowly, they are choosing tokens and currencies thinking about fundamentals, what kind of team does it, do they think about legal part, analyse the technology included. Investors search did the team already find a product-market-fit or do they just talking that they did or maybe are they just another scam? As far as I know, there are not many tools for investors. Especially for investors who think that charts aren’t everything.

I’m working with a team based in Warsaw, where we’re trying to build a good tool for investors - not only for traders (but frankly speaking I can imagine traders using it), and I wanted to show you that - because some of you might find it interesting. You can check all the tokens on Ethereum blockchain, but we described just around 600 of them (we took a list of tokens on EtherDelta and researched them). 

One of the strategies I think might be helpful in investing in crypto is watching wise investors who are careful and slow in making decisions, and learning from them, observing - you know, the old-school way. In this tool I want to show you can see for example 10 top holders of a particular token, and also how much the other token holders have all together. You can check top holders’ other transactions, all their activities on the blockchain. So if an investor (or maybe trader?) is interested in looking for whales and they want to see what this particular investor has so they could buy same tokens.

You will also find there all the links to the official social media created by the token creators and so on. 

So this tool is basically an interface to the ethereum blockchain - you can also search your account and check the list of your activities, the list of your tokens and what kind of transactions you have been making concerning this particular token. 

Answering the question which you didn’t ask yet: yes, we know the etherscan, but also we know that it can be shown in a better way - i’m not saying that we did that, I’m saying that we’re searching for it.

I want to show you this tool, but just please - don’t expect too much :) it's in a beta version, and it’s still in progress. Any feedback and comments will be crucial for us. 

So if you would like to check for example ZRX- 0x tokens you can do that here: http://trivial.co/t/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498 (the number in the link is just a smart contract number of ZRX - you can check it with any different token on Ethereum blockchain).

If you would like to check the balance or tokens of any address - you can do that here: http://trivial.co/profile/XXXXXXXXXX - where XXXXXXXXX is any account number. So basically it’s working like etherscan - we don’t collect any data, it’s always on users’ site.

I never buy tokens just watching the charts - I always do research, trying to know the team, talk to them, check their social medias, reddit posts - I hope that our tool will also help me with getting some of the tokens better.

I hope you will find it useful :) Please tell me also if you will hate it - you know how it is with your own children - you don't always see all their weaknesses.

Giving myself a crash course in bitcoin and have some techo questions for the boffins if this is the right forum. Some of the the questions are basic, but I haven't seen them addressed so far in the materials I've been using. Feel free to dissuade me any of misunderstandings or false assumptions embedded..

1) How do miners decide when it's time to calculate a block?
At some point each miner decides it has selected enough transactions from the mempool for a block and starts hashing. What is this point - is it based on a number of transactions or the 10-minute timer or other? Is it well-defined?

2) Each miner is computing a different block - does this affect the odds of a solution?
Each miner can select a different set of transactions from the mempool so no miner is calculating the same block. When there is more than one solved block, the other nodes just choose the first received.
Would the average solve time of the network be any different if all miners were computing the same block?

3) Will some miners be computing the same block some of the time by random chance?
Presumably miners using the same code or a similar algorithm to select transactions from the mempool will end up trying to compute the same block some of the time.

4) How are nonces selected?
The original bitcoin paper says miners ""implement the proof-of-work by incrementing a nonce"". In practice does mining code use an increment function from a zero or initial random value, or use say a random function or other. An issue here is that if all miners started from the same nonce (such as zero) then it probably reduces the chance of a mining fee because it increases the chance of another miner solving the same block at the same time and randomly being selected as the longest chain (assuming point 3 above)

5) Is anything clever done with selecting the nonce in order to decrease the solve time?
Presumably not as that's the point of a good hash algorithm - no relation to the input. Nevertheless I wanted to double-check this point.

6) How do nodes verify transactions?
We have a merkle tree hash for transactions in each block, but how are transactions verified before being added to the block? The satoshi paper seems to say that nodes maintain a ""global"" merkle tree for this purpose. Is this built from the plaintext transactions in all blocks and how large is this data structure currently? Does this data structure have any impact on bitcoin's scalability as the number of unique addresses grows?

7) Are bitcoin ASICs essentially specialised in performing SHA256 at minimal electrical cost?

Appreciate any comments on the above!

As an ex freight forwarder worker this could be huge and I think it will be. Maersk is the world's largest container shipping company. This does not need any cryptocurrency exchanges like other cryptocurrency company's that are trying to do any supply chain solutions for example ""CargoX"".

My first questions has been always why these some ICOs or current business concepts need a coin? I have trying to find more details on this but my knowledge in blockchain is not good and I have little hard time to understand why some blockchain business concepts need's their own coin.

If its true that blockchain technology can be done without cryptocurrency exchange, coins?(Please enlighten me on this one) I see lot of coins dropping out. Because big existing company's will do it without any coin exchanging. I believe in coins that are trying to be just an currency itself or just an customer value adding bonus methods when buying goods. Nothing more.

I suppose as a payment it makes sense, but you hear 'utility' used a lot, and correct my if I am wrong, it appears simply to 'trap' consumers into a business ecosystem, simply like credit or vouchers for a traditional business, so people have to buy and receive a token. 

But if thats the case the token itself does not have any intrinsic value? because the company do not benefit from revenue from it once it is traded on the marketplace, they are not buying a voucher e.g. like from amazon where fiat goes to Amazons, profit/income statement

I am a software developer by trade and have been dabbling with mining / trading for a while. I've been doing some research into developing something based on a block chain, mainly just to see what it is like and to get a better understanding of it from a technical level. I have a few questions and wanted to see if someone can help me clear up these points:

1) How do block chain explorers work? I know that there are plenty of sites online that provide transaction / address lookup, how do they get the data? For example, what would I do if I wanted to get a live stream of all BTC transactions and build my own blockchain explorer for a particular blockchain? Do I HAVE to go through blockchain explorer provided by someone or is there a way to tap into the raw data somehow like if I was running a full node and could hit it directly? How does this work for other coins? For example if I wanted to do the same thing for LTC / XVG, etc... would I have to run a full node for each coin? Are the APIs sort of similar?

For reference, ProHashing has an explorer that has support for many coins, I am looking for something like that: https://prohashing.com/explorer/Digibyte/

2) Any good resources on creating your own mining client? I don't expect to make any profit with this, but I'd like to go through the motions to understand better what is going on under the hood. From my understanding most of the work distribution happens via Stratum protocol, which allows a single miner like CGMiner to work for many algorithms / coins. Is that correct? What is a good path forward on this?

3) From my understanding network hash rate are only estimates and calculated by looking at the time between blocks and difficulty, is that correct? Is that pretty much standard between various coins? For example coinwarz provides a lot of stats, similar to prohashing explorer. https://www.coinwarz.com/cryptocurrency How can this be done at scale with minimal effort?

4) Currently I do most of my development using python for backend and node / angular on the front end. I do not have any experience with some of the more widespread and ""industrial grade"" languages like C or Java. Although I understand that most chain nodes provide a JSON RPC interface that would be accessible regardless of the language, what would be a good language to pick up if I wanted to build my own blockchain / coin or contribute code to some open source projects? I know that BTC is written in C++ and Ethereum is written in Go, there are a few othehr projects that are based on Go as well and I am thinking it might be a good pick. Does anyone have any recommendations / feedback?

5) Any good libraries I should check out? So far, I've played around with ccxt which is really awesome for grabbing price information. What other cool libraries are there?

Thanks in advance for feedback, and please let me know if this is a wrong Sub, I couldn't find a more appropriate one.

Is it possible to take out the network by attacking all of the nodes or would it run at reduced capacity?   
Similarly could a malicious node shutdown the competing nodes to gain a majority either to earn all the validator rewards or 51% attack the network?  I imagine it could be quite profitable to short the market, take out a node or two and cause FUD and/or keep it down for a ransom.

This is something I haven't seen discussed much but I am no expert and I assume the nodes will have some form of DOS defence so it may not be a major issue.

I think that a company linking their tech to a coin often makes no sense. For example, this is how Quantstep is planning to use its coin (QSP):

I see no reason why the company can't get paid in any currency (including fiat). The only reason I can think of to have a coin linked to your tech is to be able to get money from an ICO, and later sell your own coins off before letting your company collapse.

Another example is the coins Golem and SONM, both of which allow people who want to run computationally expensive code to pay (using coins) other people to run that code on their computers. Why not just provide this service and use another cryptocurrency or even fiat currency to pay?

Clearly there must be a reason, because it's so popular. Help me understand?

Far from the automated nirvana we somehow expect where blockchain technology somehow guarantees that funds are never lost, the weak point is the exchanges themselves. They are simply overloaded due to popularity but this is not just a minor inconvenience, crypto transactions are going missing all the time resulting in lost funds and support tickets, sometimes for huge amounts at crucial times. Binance, Bittrex, Kraken - its happening on all the popular exchanges - sometimes during “system upgrades” and sometimes for no discernible reason at all.

Whilst banks and fiat exchange are by no means infallible and you can still lose money for weeks if you transfer to the wrong account, crypto is supposed to be heralding a new, better way of transacting but the user experience currently is terrible.

Not being able to send crypto due to maintenance is one thing but lost funds is unacceptable and the worst thing for consumer confidence. Sadly there is no shining example I can find of a popular site that doesn’t do this.

The exchanges need to get their s$^% together.

But they also need to be easy to setup and use.

For example, Raiblocks is a hyped coin as fast and cheap.

But it's new user experience is absolutely terrible.

It takes more than 12 hours to sync on an SSD, and 48 hours on an HDD, so it won't get mainstream adoption.

There's a hack if you go searching reddit where you can download the database, etc, but regular users won't know/do that.

This bad experience led me to think how far away crypto is from a user experience perspective?

I might even argue that getting the UX right might even be easier than the technical challenges.

Are there any coins out there that:

- have a well designed mobile wallet (for mainstream, we need something that is lightweight enough to be used on a phone)

- this wallet takes &lt; 2 mins to sync the first time it's used

- if you want to send some of that coin to a friend it takes &lt; 2 mins, and is easy to do for a regular user

Vitalik Buterin suggested that the PoW capabilities of average sender node are too small against the potential PoW capabilities of attackers. CfB argued that in IOTA's network-bound PoW consensus, nodes have the ability to occupy some range of the EM spectrum for some interval of time, which works as an anti-Sybil measure.

Now, what if the network agrees to take a snapshot every 1000 or so blocks? Basically, you create a snapshot balance for every address by calculating all transactions to and from that address since the last snapshot. This ""snapshot block"" can then be validated by every node on the network. Calculating current balance on an address at any time simply has to start from the most recent snapshot then adding/subtracting the transactions after that snapshot.

In fact, the scalable issues is not about TPS which seems somehow solved, it is about :

- ""living time""
- Address use
- Coins in circulation 

#Living Time
Let's explain myself : Currently every crypto use a unique ""file"" to store all transactions, and this file grow and grow (BTC : 1Mo/10min, XRB : 30Mo/day...)

IOTA tries to solve this using snapshots, but it it becomes widely used tangle will grow really fast and will be impossible to sync over nodes

This is an important point, in fact this will likely turn nodes in centralization (with huge infrastructures costs)

#Address use
If every one use cryptos this will lead in 2 problems looking at address:

- It will be easier to find the private part of the address (brute force), to solve this it could exists a second private address (that we can modify)
- Use of all addresses (well this point will likely never happen)

#Coins in circulation
Currently I read that the Global Money Supply is $90.4 trillion (so 10^16 (14 + 2 digits for cents)). I don't know any crypto that have that much money (furthermore there is inflation)

#A solution
The only current ""solution"" I found is holochain, but I still have some issues with it (looking at 0 sum money, non uniqueness wallet for one people etc...)

For uniqueness I can imagine you have to be recognized by 5 people, and those same 5 people can't recognize someone else (4 of them + 1 other can).

In order to generate coin I can think about solving a medical problem or a consensus to generate new coins (but who should receive those coins)... 

#Finally
Do you know any CryptoTechnology that would be able to solve this problem? (and still have environmental concerns, quantum resistant etc..)

#What we will loose with crypto
As a side note I would like to share some concerns about our actual financial system:

- possibility to cancel / disable card if robed
- follow the inflation by placing money
- insurance

What, in your opinion, is the best technology to back up your wallets? Are there any additional number of backup strategies not on this list? 

**1: Paper wallet / Cryptosteel wallet**. These involve the wallet mnemonic being distributed to a number of different physical locations. The wallets are either written in plaintext or obfuscated. They have the drawback that increasing the number of copies of the mnemonic increases risk of loss through leaking the seed, unless the mnemonic is competently hidden, for example using [steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography). 

**2: Encrypted digital wallet / wallet seed**. This involves encrypting the wallet with an extremely strong passphrase and distributing it onto the cloud as well as various geographical locations, in a fashion similar to [321 backup](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-3-2-1-backup-strategy/). This has the drawback of being easily cracked if the passphrase is not sufficiently strong, as well as needing to trust that the computer on which the mnemonic is being encrypted is not compromised, but increasing the number of copies does not significantly increase risk of loss of funds. 

**3: Hardware wallets** (such as Ledger, Trezor) Since these wallets come with their own encryption, they can be distributed geographically with the same unlock key. However, they are subject to normal hardware degradation and generally they tend to be used with one of the former backup techniques.

Lately I have been really fascinated with how the question of governance is playing out in this field. I am talking about, for example, Delegated Proof of Stake consensus models, in projects like Ark and Icon, and the movement from PoW to PoS in general. For people who aren't aware, it is something like a republic or indirect democracy, where you vote on representatives who then have a say in policies moving forward, or who earn profit by acting as validators on the network. But I wonder how these platforms will encourage voter participation in choosing these delagates, and foster fair ideals? I wonder how we will ensure good actors who value some more ephemeral things like decentralization and transparency which many crpyto enthusiasts hold dear, over pure profit motive or pure technical efficiency. It seems like all the difficulties and imperfections of governance we deal with today are arising in crypto land, and they may pose a threat to many people's ideologies of pure decentralization. 

A separate but related thought: how do people feel about so much power shifting to technologists? Depending on the influence of these networks on our society, and depending on the influence of certain representatives on those networks, it seems like technologists will have an enormous power on people. We already see this in the global power of companies like Facebook and Google, where people even started to speculate that Zuckerberg might run for president and solidify that influence on a governmental level. I wonder if crypto in so energetically exploring governance models might accelerate that future, for better or worse.

Honestly I am still wrapping my head around this and need to dive into it in more detail. But for the time being I thought I'd open a general discussion and see where it goes. So, I'll leave you with a few general questions if anyone would like to respond, or you could post your own thoughts/questions here.


* Do any details of governance systems on crypto platforms worry you? Which governance models excite you and why?

##Scalable, transparent, and post-quantum secure computational integrity

Eli Ben-Sasson* Iddo Bentov† Yinon Horesh* Michael Riabzev*

January 9, 2018

###Abstract

Human dignity demands that personal information, like medical and forensic data, be hidden from
the public. But veils of secrecy designed to preserve privacy may also be abused to cover up lies and
deceit by parties entrusted with Data, unjustly harming citizens and eroding trust in central institutions.

Zero knowledge (ZK) proof systems are an ingenious cryptographic solution to the tension between
the ideals of personal privacy and institutional integrity, enforcing the latter in a way that does not
compromise the former. Public trust demands transparency from ZK systems, meaning they be set up
with no reliance on any trusted party, and have no trapdoors that could be exploited by powerful parties to
bear false witness. For ZK systems to be used with Big Data, it is imperative that the public verification
process scale sublinearly in data size. Transparent ZK proofs that can be verified exponentially faster
than data size were first described in the 1990s but early constructions were impractical, and no ZK
system realized thus far in code (including that used by crypto-currencies like Zcash™) has achieved
both transparency and exponential verification speedup, simultaneously, for general computations.

Here we report the first realization of a transparent ZK system (ZK-STARK) in which verification
scales exponentially faster than database size, and moreover, this exponential speedup in verification
is observed concretely for meaningful and sequential computations, described next. Our system uses
several recent advances on interactive oracle proofs (IOP), such as a “fast” (linear time) IOP system for
error correcting codes.

Our proof-of-concept system allows the Police to prove to the public that the DNA profile of a
Presidential Candidate does not appear in the forensic DNA profile database maintained by the Police.
The proof, which is generated by the Police, relies on no external trusted party, and reveals no further
information about the contents of the database, nor about the candidate’s profile; in particular, no DNA
information is disclosed to any party outside the Police. The proof is shorter than the size of the DNA
database, and verified faster than the time needed to examine that database naively.

Assuming that the main goal of (almost every) cryptocurrency is somehow substitute Fiat payments and exclude a central counterpart  (central banks, government, banks in generel - doesnt matter).

(Note: I don't call a government or central banks bad)

Currently there aren't many companies accepting crypto. The more companies will accept crypto and the more you can do with it in general, the higher the chance of regulators to go deep into cryptos or shut them down legally. Just look at topics like the KYC process. It's to prevent (not only) money laundering. If you are able to life your life without fiats, you won't need a KYC process anywhere. That's something the government would want to deny. (So that criminals can't do what they want etc.)

I'm more of an observer and I rarely post anything, but I was hoping someone smarter and more experienced than I could shed some insight or share their thoughts on this project. 

Also I'm really grateful for this sub, the thoughtful discussion and sound analysis makes me feel sane again after the total circus that r/ cryptocurrency has become!

The first token, VET, will be used for staking and as a network currency. The second, THOR, will be used to pay network fees..

On the surface, VET/THOR seems quite similar to NEO/GAS. In both instances, you are rewarded with the latter token by holding the former. However, if you dig a bit beneath the surface, the intended crypto-economic incentives in each system are somewhat different. 

The incentive to hold NEO is made obvious when you consider the name of its forebear, AntShares - it is akin to holding shares in the network. You earn voting rights on the network and receive dividends in the form of GAS. If you want to use the network, you buy GAS, not NEO.

VET, on the other hand, has quite a different purpose to NEO. One of the stated aims of VeChain's switch to a dual token model is ""to offer a stable and predictable budget to enterprise users"". But how is that the case if THOR is neither pegged to USD nor to VET? 

The answer is that a business can buy a set quantity of VET to generate enough THOR to power their use of the network. There is a single initial investment into VET, which can fund their subsequent usage of the chain in perpetuity (if the network manages to scale). VeChain's governance mechanism will have the power to adjust the protocol's monetary policy to ensure that crypto-economic incentives remain in equilibrium. 

This model actually puts me in mind of EOS, where the purchase of x percentage of the EOS supply will grant you a corresponding percentage of network bandwidth. However, in EOS, you will need to hold enough EOS tokens in order to cover the maximum demand you might place on bandwidth at any given time. For example, if someone is using EOS and their peak demand at any given time is 1% of bandwidth, then they will always need to hold 1% of tokens, even if the majority of the time they only require 0.5% of network bandwidth. Holding the rights to more bandwidth than you need is inefficient. 

The dual token model in VeChain solves that problem. The introduction of THOR tokenises an account holder's right to network bandwidth, allowing them to store that bandwidth for use at a later date. The account holder only needs to hold enough tokens to cover their average usage rather than their peak usage, thereby increasing the efficiency of resource allocation. 

The downside to VeChain's model is that it is vulnerable to network-wide surges in demand. If everyone stores their THOR then decides to use it as the same time, the demand for bandwidth will exceed supply, and we all know what happens when demand for network resources exceeds supply. 

Moreover, unlike EOS, it is possible to purchase bandwidth on VeChain without ownership of VET by simply purchasing THOR directly. It is not clear to me whether there will be significant demand for that given the superiority of owning VET, which throws into question the market value of THOR and thus the security incentives of the VeChain network. For VeChain to function, there has to be a steady demand for THOR from non-VET holders.

_Outlook_:

AIDOC aims to use medical data and AI technology to provide constant health and wellness insights. Blockchain combined with advanced imaging technology will ensure data integrity and enable a live 3D visual of users' health from vital sign readings, offering users 24-hour health analysis from a digital medical expert (an AI) capable of anticipating problems and prescribing solutions.

They also have plans for further combining smart hardware with IoT applications to build a full ecosystem of health services that will span various regions of the medical services industry.

_Partnership_:

AIDOC has formed a strategic collaboration with MEDP.AI for medical support. Founded in January 2015 by senior scientists from Baidu and Microsoft and well-known professors from top universities, MEDP.AI is a leading medical artificial intelligence company in China. The company has successively developed several kinds of artificial intelligence products such as chest CT intelligent auxiliary diagnosis system, chest X-ray intelligent auxiliary diagnosis system, etc...; provided services to hundreds of medical institutions; and acquired more than 40 national patents and related technology rights.

_Value_ _of_ _token_:

The core value of AIDOC in the current phase lies in obtaining tokens by mining through vital sign data. Users’ vital sign data is now mainly from third-party applications, such as iOS health data center, health APP and so on. Now, a number of smart medical hardware manufacturers are working closely with AIDOC to launch customized version to get more accurate vital sign data and avoid cheating, so as to ensure that the interests of users are not infringed.

_Business_ _Model_ _Architecture_

From the whitepaper, AIDOC has a clear plan to incentivize every participant in the protocol. From users; medical institutions, R&amp;D Institutions, Enterprises; AI developers; to even Government Medical Administration, they will all benefit from participating in the network.

I have been following this subreddit since two weeks now and today I decided to try and get some of those coins. It is really more to try as my understanding as a whole could surely be more deep, however I did some research. 


I got a small amount of money and bought some ETH on Coinbase. Then transferred 32% of it on Kucoin to buy some REQ. I also have created a MEW wallet. My intention is to hold some ETH and REQ, hoping (and believing) their value will rise.


I would like to ask you guys a couple of questions on my experience:


* do you personally think holding on those two currencies makes sense ?
* would you suggest converting a higher % of my ETH into REQ ?
* don't you feel both Coinbase and Kucoin fees to be expensive ?
* for this reason, I left my ETH and REQ in those websites wallet (to avoid withdrawal fees), would you still suggest to put them on MEW ?
* do you have any tip to give a newbie ?
* are there any particular readings that you suggest I could do ?
* any other sort of advice ?


Hoping you guys can help me having a more concrete understanding and hoping I am not breaking any rule. Thank you very much for your help.


*Disclaimer: I own a small amount of ETH and REQ*

I am a backend developer with experience in C, C++, Java, RDBMS and decent exposure to python, perl, javascript, node.js, AWS in wide variety on companies.

I actually started to study Cryptocurrency course from Coursera by Princeton, but their assignments are based in Java. 
Why Java when blockchains use C, C++ and smart contracts use scripting languages?

I looked and some job postings and most of them ask for hyperledger or ethereum experience.
Most of the ICOs use ethereum while hyperledger is more for enterprises I believe.
Any thoughts on which is more lucrative and which one has more scope and demand?
And the best way to study these?

Any suggestions where I can contribute to some open source project to gain experience?
Or work for a startup for no salary?

I think this is a bigger challenge than scaling (which will be eventually solved), or regulatory/taxation hurdles (which will eventually be worked out).

The problem is as follows:

1. Speculative holding and trading makes for extreme price volatility.
2. End users don't want this volatility and will hold crypto assets for the least possible time (max of seconds).
3. High user velocity results in low coin values for non burnable tokens, so coin values stay purely speculative.

Here are a few ways to attack the problem:

**Isolate volatility to service providers:** I think this is the most effective strategy. Factom does this the best of any projects I know about. Companies can pay a flat price for entry credits without ever needing to hold crypto. Crypto exposure is only borne by service providers, who operate at market rates and should be willing to accept asset volatility. I think smart contract platforms like Ethereum similarly can succeed by separating stakers and infrastructure type services from stable coins and other tokenized assets running on top. In the long run, I wouldn't expect owners of Ethereum based insurance policies to be paid in ETH, even if the smart contract is run on ETH and ETH is held as collateral.

**Burn-to-use tokens:** Tokens that are burned when used should theoretically be more price stable because velocity isn't a factor in price. Again Factom is the project I think of with this feature, but there are other burn-to-use tokens.

**Hedging:** Mechanisms to hedge prices may help spur usage, but I think in most cases the costs involved would overwhelm the benefits of having a cryptocurrency in the first place. I don't know of any projects that offer direct hedging, although decentralized exchanges like Kyber and 0x may help facilitate these solutions.

**Getting such wide and general acceptance that prices stabilize:** Theoretically if a cryptocurrency eventually gets to be so big that a majority of retailers and people are willing to accept it, prices should become as stable as any foreign fiat currency. In that state holding and shopping with Bitcoin would be the equivalent of living in the US but being able to hold and spend Euros. The problem with this is the chicken-and-egg problem in that you can't get wide acceptance when coins are only held by speculators. I think this will ultimately be the downfall of Bitcoin, Dash, Raiblocks, and most other pure payment systems. IOTA has the same chicken-and-egg problem, so I think it's interesting that /u/DavidSonstebo recognizes this and is taking steps to jumpstart acceptance including working with banks on quick exchange solutions, starting their own datamart, and convincing Bosch to buy a number of IOTA to force start usage. We'll see if it works.

The Gems Protocol is attempting to decentralize contracting workers for micro-tasks.

Overview: Currently there is a market ripe for disruption due to in-efficiencies of having a centralized market place for both requesters (people who need micro tasks completed) and miners (people who perform the micro tasks). The main inefficiencies are:

1. Large overhead costs. Amazon Mechanical Turk charges requesters a minimum of a 20% fee for any amount paid to miners, charging more for miners with good track records and more for tasks with 10 or more assignments, leading to fees of around 40%. Crowdflower, a recent VC competitor that raised nearly $60M, charges a $3k onboarding fee and $1.5k monthly recurring fee and a 15% charge. All of this puts downward pressure on the wages miners take home. GEMS changes this because their platform does not take ANY fees from either side.

2. Low Accessibility. Many potential miners do not have access to bank accounts and therefore cannot participate in the current micro task economy. GEMS are paid out on the blockchain so anyone with access to the blockchain can now receive access to payout. In addition, Mechanical Turk / Crowdflower requires identification verification, where as GEMS does not. It instead relies on a decentralized trust system based on how reliably previous tasks were completed. With two different layers, verifiers and requesters independently vetting each completed assignment, malicious actors or actors who perform poor quality work will be weeded out quickly. Since the trust score is designed to build slowly at the beginning, creating a new account / address would not be in any valid actor's best interest and would require too much effort for a malicious actor.

3. Bad Usability. Mechanical turk has a terribly unfriendly UI / UX. Many programs have to be built on top of it to make it accessible, also increasing the barrier to usage and increasing turn around time for tasks. GEMS will have interfaces called modules built on top for specific tasks to help aid the workers in completing their tasks. These will be open sourced.

By tackling these issues, GEMS can cut out the middle man and create an efficient micro task ecosystem. GEMS tokens have utility since miners are required to stake tokens before performing work to ensure quality results and to deter malicious actors and for requesters to pay miners.

In terms of competition, it seems to fulfill a niche similar to Dragonchain. The team and documentation available seem to be similar and the industry definitely allows for the current valuation. However, PRNewsWire compares it instead to [Ethereum](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/achain-a-popular-blockchain-in-china-300523513.html), which makes sense in a way because it's meant to be a smart contracts platform. The article also mention Achain's sandbox mechanism, which is particularly attractive for new businesses who want to have some kind of 'blockchain trial' before they make any kind of investment. Are there any other tokens allowing this? They've also been called the ['Chinese Ark'](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArkEcosystem/comments/7nlany/achain_ark_china_version/) although the reddit post about it isn't very convincing.

According to [this table](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/YnGdh-w2-FID4qhOlbWsvHMl2-qjvDwYpRtNUnwFIdCpzUVbiCTzQFdUTEFWAd9kcca3GB2JRw=w1680), they've also got over 30 dApps already. I'm trying to track them now. I'm finding it very difficult to find dirt on the project. 

Cointelegraph also covered it in a very 'meh' [article](https://cointelegraph.com/news/after-blockshow-how-achains-fork-theory-has-worked-in-real-life) that doesn't tell us much.

I'd love it if anyone who speaks Chinese could help me do some research, because some of the resources I find are in Chinese.

One of the first things I learned in crypto is that each project seem to have a so called 'white paper' where the team behind the project publishes their vision for the future, main ideas, some mathematical analysis and how they are going to achieve their promises. While I wasn't expecting the standard to be so high, I still was expecting these papers to be good considering that in most cases the team has multiple people working there and the projects are asking for millions of dollars.

To my surprise, I was absolutely shocked when I started reading these papers. The vast majority of them seem to be utter trash. Tron whitepaper if was submitted as an assignment in any university would have been a fail without question. Even projects that seem to interest me like bounty0x seem to have basic problems with formatting (seriously guys, why do you not use LaTeX in your paper instead of word, especially considering that every team has someone who did some computer science uni when it is anathema to send an assignment in Word) which make me immediately less interested in putting money there. I mean, if a company asking for tens of millions of dollars cannot manage writing in a way that a second year university student can, then how am I to trust them with my money (I like bounty project though). Now I know that most of the marketing is done in twitter, but it shouldn't be that difficult to do some work in the fundamentals too.

Just to give some balance, I like a lot the BTC paper, and if you read that and then you read a paper of a modern alt-coin immediately, you are going to vomit. Ethereum white paper while written in a blog-like style is a joy to read. From the recent ones, XLM and BAT papers are written well and scream professionalism, which made me interested to read them and then to start doing research on those coins.

I know i'm not the only one but as things stand, I am running the 2.5.6 IOTA windows desktop wallet and my balance shows 0.

People have told me my funds are fine and once the new wallet is out my funds will appear but I can't help but be sceptical. Is it really going to be a case of entering my seed (original or one created for reclaim tool?) into this new wallet and my funds will be there?

I've honestly contemplated just handing over my seeds to someone on reddit and telling them to keep a quarter and send the rest to me, most likely i'll be scammed but at this point I feel like i'm never seeing them again anyway!

**https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04069**

&gt; Abstract: In this work, we propose a straightforward method to derive Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) key pairs from embeddings created using Deep Learning and Metric Learning approaches. We also show that these keys allows the derivation of cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin) addresses that can be used to transfer and receive funds, allowing novel Blockchain-based applications that can be used to transfer funds or data directly to domains such as image, text, sound or any other domain where Deep Learning can extract high-quality embeddings; providing thus a novel integration between the properties of the Blockchain-based technologies such as trust minimization and decentralization together with the high-quality learned representations from Deep Learning techniques. 

Essentially the paper describes a method to train an embedding model that takes as input an image (and also other similar images) and produces as output ECDSA key-pair from the learned representations that were created by deep learning models. The key-pair can later be converted to public-private wallet address, allowing funds to be sent to there. In this way, only someone with the same image or similar (where the similarity is on this feature representation manifold) image and optionally a password would be allowed to redeem the fund on that address. It's similar to a brainwallet, but using features extracted from a Deep Learning model. 

I feel that it will open the door for some cool new applications, however I'm racking my brain trying to think of where this could actually be useful.

I came across this article:

https://www.coindesk.com/blockchain-token-velocity-problem/

I am fascinated by the notion of velocity which this article defines at how quickly a token changes hands. They seem to argue that holding is what appreciates a token versus just demand of a service (i.e. adoption) in the long term. For example, someone has little incentive to hold token X which only allows for payment of decentralized cloud computing service, so they'd use some seamless exchange like 0x to *only* buy it when the service is required. If this theory is correct, it could really be a downer on speculators who hold tokens where there's no actual incentive to hold.

I could also see that adoption *could* help to some extent as people will inevitably hold these assets but the token value would not increase linearly relative to adoption.

Often you can make everything look good and work now with focused optimizations, but you'll pay in the future when the solution isn't flexible or scalable enough. Alternatively you can take the time to think through all the long term needs and build a robust solution, but this can take longer and perform worse in the short run.

I'm curious if anyone has any thoughts on how different crypto projects approach this trade off.

For example, I think the toxic bitcoin scaling debate basically boils down to the following. **Bitcoin Core:** ""Satoshi's whitepaper and block size increases only allow for linear scaling, so increasing block sizes now will give a short term boost at the expense of long term scalability as the blockchain grows. We should prepare for other solutions.""  **Bitcoin Cash:** ""We need on-chain scaling NOW consistent with the whitepaper or bitcoin will become unuseable and die before any other solutions can be built.""

I think Vitalik and the dev team are very conscious of the balance between short and long term with Ethereum. Instead of starting with a half-baked Proof of Stake implementation that could limit future work, they started with the tried and tested Proof of Work while developing and thinking through the implementation for the best long term Proof of Stake model. I think many Ethereum competitors (NEO, EOS, Cardano, etc) need hype and funding now, so they use designs that are very fast short term but could be at the expense of long term sustainability. I could design a super fast system that elects one node to handle all transactions and I could post videos to Reddit how excited I am to see sub 1 second transfer times between wallets. Of course this system would fail when scaled due to node bottlenecks and node election issues.

An example of a project I think is solely focused on long term at the expense of short term is IOTA. There are all kinds of usability issues and complaints with current setup, but the devs seem to be laser focused on their long term vision as an IoT protocol and aren't making many design compromises to make the system work better today. Time will tell whether they will make it to their long term vision, or if developers will switch to something like RaiBlocks that is more usable now but maybe has more questionable long term prospects.

I even had thought a while ago when walking past a homeless person and thinking there must be a way tech could allow donating to needy people with a little more certainty on where it gets spent (but wasn't aware of blockchain).

From a tech perspective, how effective could this be for donation certainty from the big business level (say, Oxfam) down to donating money to a homeless guy on the street (could it it be possible to only allow certain stores/products to accept giftcoins payments)?

Is it too idealistic or would blockchain and a separate currency make it possible to donate to the needy without the worries/excuses of corruption, or the money being spent on booze and drugs?

I feel there is a bigger question, on secondary markets opening up with people trading their Giftcoins for cash, but not sure if even that can be locked down... and perhaps too wide a scope for this sub.

Whitepaper: [CHSB Technical Whitepaper](https://swissborg.com/files/swissborg-technical-whitepaper.pdf)

Hey guys,

I stumbled across and invested some ETH in CHSB. After reading the whitepaper and questionable sections several times I am still relatively dumbfunded. To establish the roadmap:

1. Swissborg is raising capital via an ICO. The resulting funds will be used to create a crypto hedge fund with roughly 4% fees  per year (1% per quarter) and additional performance fees. There will be 4 different index funds. So far so good.

2. The raised capital will also be used to create a second layer smart contract solution called Smart Mandate. Portfolio management based on this would be largely AI-based. Whatever the fuck that means.

3. ICO participants are rewarded the CHSB token (called Cryptallion in the whitepaper and sometimes CSB) which is neither a stake in the fond nor in the proposed smart contract solution. The CHSB token will largely work as a stake in the development of Swissborgs platform. CHSB tokens award voting rights for participation in votes about the current development roadmap. Voters are rewarded another token for their participation with the Referendum Token called RSB. There are no voting rights with regards to the investment itself, the company itself or dividends.

This is where the whitepaper stops with a promise to deliver more information. 

My take on this:

The CHSB token doesnt solve any inefficiency. (See edit1) The inefficiency Swissborg intends to solve is removing organizational overhead costs for running crypto-investment funds via ETH Blockchain and their second layer tech. (Page 13f.) The value proposition of the CHSB token is a stake in the development of the companys core product. (Page 20f.)

Incidentally Swissborg does not seem to believe in an amazing valuation of the product themselves. They forecast a token value for the company in 2019 of 27.6 Mil. CHF compared to 19.05 Mil. CHF in 2018. A nice 44% increase. But they dont seem to trust an increase in valuation for any following year and see their growth in their Crypto-Indexes. (Page 23) 

Edit1: The CHSB Token does solve the inefficiency of a fund and contracting platform not serving the interests of its community. *But* without a buy-in in the Swissborg Cryptofund itself a token holder will not be part of the positive feedback loop. While the fund looks promising the token is a big question mark. I also cannot find any information on what dividends paid out from profit valuations of the index funds PAST the ICO.

Edit2 and conclusion: After compiling all this information it seems to me like this is a castrated stock emission designed to lure in funds without any real stake in the company. I do think Swissborg is trustworthy. I do think the token has value. But there is no information on minimum entry amounts to the fund and very little information about it in general. And without fund participation there is very little indication to actually be a token holder in my opinion. Unless there is some giant misunderstanding on my side I will likely dump the token and cash-out the ICO markup.

We all know that Washington basically runs on bribes. Whoever has the most money to throw around get's exactly what they want.

Either by creating a new Net Neutrality coin/blockchain or using some current blockchain technology. Please feel free to share your ideas.

Which type are you investing in?","""Decentralized exchange"" technology comes in two types:

1. Currency-neutral
2. Currency-centric

**Currency-centric** decentralized exchanges are built on top of an existing coin platform, such as Ethereum, Counterparty.io and the endless drove of Johnny-come-lately new platforms. These currency-centric exchanges A) are NOT a new idea by any stretch of the imagination, and more important than this B) require you to operate within the confines of a specific coin's ecosystem.

For example, a currency-centric decentralized exchange built on Ethereum will ONLY be able to autonomously escrow Ethereum-based assets (i.e. ERC20s) for blockchain-based trading. Likewise, a currency-centric decentralized exchange like Counterparty.io will ONLY be able to autonomously escrow Counterparty-based assets for blockchain-based trading.

When people say a certain exchange is a ""decentralized exchange"", you need to reflect back on the fact such exchanges are *insular* to the coin upon which they're built. In addition, IMO you should reflect on the fact this style of decentralized exchange has proliferated since early 2014, and so the approach is just plain not new or novel in any respect.

Conversely, **currency-neutral** decentralized exchange technology hasn't been perfected, and is truly the cutting edge of decentralized trading.

Unlike currency-centric decentralized exchange tech, which is isolationist and insular to a given coin's ecosystem, currency-neutral decentralized exchange tech is designed to interconnect native cryptocurrencies with one another. Importantly, with currency-neutral decentralized exchanges, there are no limitations on which coin you can trade, and you needn't buy into any given cryptocurrency ecosystem to use the decentralized exchange.

For example, Bisq.io is a currency-neutral decentralized exchange. Install the client on your desktop computer and you'll immediately notice how it's designed to enable trading any given cryptocurrency for any other. There's no blockchain underlying Bisq, except insofar as the tradeable cryptocurrencies listed on Bisq obviously each have their own blockchain.

Probably the single most important caveat of currency-neutral decentralized exchanges is there's no good way to do leveraged trading or options/futures contracts; for this you probably do need a currency-centric decentralized exchange (many of which are ICOs). Otherwise, for people who see the phrase ""decentralized exchange"" and think: ""decentralized Poloniex"", what you really want is a currency-neutral option like Bisq.io.

Note a confounding factor to currency-centric decentralized exchanges is the propensity of currency-centric developers to ICO their project. This frequently leads to meritless hype and endless shilling of currency-centric decentralized exchanges, which comes at the cost of liquidity on true currency-neutral decentralized exchanges like Bisq.

As a community of traders who are interested in lowering the importance of centralized exchanges like Poloniex, we are doing ourselves a disservice by hyping currency-centric decentralized exchanges which don't accomplish the goal, siphon liquidity from exchanges like Bisq, and distract newcomers.

IMO the future of decentralized exchanges will without a doubt feature cross-chain atomic swap technology for trustlessly and instantly trading one cryptocurrency for another without a middleman. Your currency-centric decentralized exchange is GOING to be shellacked by this, because there's no reason you need to interject an entire new coin into this equation, wherein the currency-centric decentralized exchange's underlying coin effectively becomes a middleman in that its investors are needlessly rent-seeking.",NA,"7rj2jy",NA,0,NA,"false",1518557525,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","","noflair","false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/7rj2jy/rcryptotech_psa_there_are_broadly_two_types_of/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,1

Video summary:

What is a graph?

- A data structure that has nodes (vertices) and lines (edges/connections)

- All of the technologies being compared in this video are technically graphs

Lightning

- Vertices (circles) == Lightning nodes

- Edges (lines) == Payment channels

- Layer 2 solution

- Routing network of payment channels

- Instant transactions

- Has fees (drawback)

- Locks up funds (drawback)

- Needs to route (drawback)

- Secured by the hash rate of Bitcoin

IOTA Tangle

- Vertices (circles) == Transactions

- Edges (lines) == Approvals

- Instant transactions

- No fees

- Central coordinator (drawback)

Nano (RaiBlocks)

- Vertices (circles) == Transactions

- Edges (dashed lines) == Pairing of senders and receivers

- Instant

- No fees

- New codebase (drawback)

Hashgraph

- Vertices (circles) == Event

- Edges (lines) == ""Told everything I know""

- Gossip about gossip

- Promises performance and security

- Patented (drawback)

- Private setting (drawback)

- Not tested publicly (drawback)

TL;DW:

- The visual representation of these technologies is similar, but they mean very different things

- All of these technologies are technically variations of the graph data structure

- Nano seems to be the only one working 100% as advertised, today

I am an iOS/backend engineer with a decent background in security investing all my non-business hours into a building a new product that would work on top of the ETH blockchain using ERC20 tokens. I am currently still researching and drafting together a prelim whitepaper for feedback.

**Question**

I have researched a bunch into ETH &amp; ERC20 including the product market I am venturing in. The primary blocker is my lack of understanding into how token transactions would work from within my application.

Consider an extremely simple flow: UserA needs to send 1 TokenX to UserB for B's service. Following things are required:

1. UserA &amp; UserB both need to have a TokenX public address associated to their user profiles (My service needs to be aware of this).
2. Money needs to be transacted from UserA to UserB.

For 1, its a bit straightforward, user's public TokenX address is somehow saved on their profile. (Not the most ideal data mapping but its essential).

What confuses me is 2: what is the backend for this transaction? Do I have to create my own service for this transaction to take place or do I have to create a smart contract on the ETH blockchain for this transaction or do I have to find some 3rd party service like Uphold to enable this transaction? I am genuinely confused here and treat me as a n00b while assisting here.

Please feel to refer me to links or other pieces of documentation. :)",NA,"7wqjjp",NA,0,NA,"false",1520517178,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","EDUCATIONAL","Training-2","false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/7wqjjp/how_to_transact_a_cryptocurrency_built_on_the/",NA,"2 - 3 years account age. 300 - 1000 comment karma.",NA,"EDUCATIONAL","",0,0

Solutions, e-commerce sites are lacking","If you are a small business owner who **doesn't want to get into hiring a developer or mess with APIs** etc to *sell a couple of digital products* **how do you accept crypto payments** for digital products?

*I've only ever seen the following non-wordpress sites*

* https://gourl.io/ ugly, limited alts, but it works for 3.5%

* https://www.cryptonator.com, cheapest, nice, limited coin and again exposes your url in the button ...

* https://www.coinpayments.net/ nice, cheap, but flawed buttons expose your url to the product for downloads....

* https://selly.gg/ currently seems the best of the above options - they charge 2.5% - but only allow 10mb digital files!

* https://shopify.com expensive and you have to buy into their eco system.

* https://rocketr.net/ $10 per month + 2% . Free monthly if you pay 5% per transaction. 

* https://satoshibox.com does what is needed but charges 6%!

There are a lot of wordpress plugins, many use coinpayments.net. **Without wordpress, are there any other sites like the above?**

People looking at setting up a digital ecommerce download type site might look at https://www.openbazaar.org - not what I'm looking for, might be useful for others.

I'm simply looking for a site that will process my digital downloads with a crypto like this

* customer clicks a button
* pop up or the like with QR and payment details etc
* successful payment and the customer is either sent an email with the download link and details or is shown a new page with download options like gourl do, eg, password and a url to go for the download but prettier.

- **Basically I'm looking for something similar to https://www.Gumroad.com which accepts PayPal and credit cards + gives you a button to put on your own website to sell a product**.

Sadly Gumroad don't accept crypto payments. But the concept is perfect. They host the file and payment gateway. You copy paste their button script onto your site, and sell away. Could not be easier.... except for crypto...

Currently coinpayments.net and cryptonator nearly get it right by allowing you to enter in a ""success url"" but the problem is the success url shows if you view the source code on the page .... which is kinda stupid.

Gourl.io get it right but charge 3.5% and is ugly. satoshibox get it right but charge 6%! Isn't crypto meant to be about being a little better than credit card payments!

**selly.gg get the whole thing right but only allow 10mb download files!** 

If you know of an alternative (non WordPress or API coding etc) do please let me know.

 I don't envisage a large sales quota but it does allow an option for customers and advertising /promotion of crypto.

I've asked around many of the sub reddits on LTC DASH and Stellar etc but nothing . Well, Stellar and other ALTs nearly get it but it's all too developer heavy again.

Here is the basis of my question:

From my understanding, ETH and ETC have pretty much the same core technology underlying them.  Why are developers flocking to ETH to build their products and applications when they could presumably build on ETC for much cheaper?  From my understanding, you must burn Ether in order to be able build on top of these platforms.  I assume you must burn the same amount of Ether on each platform before you are allowed to build (sorry if that answer is easily obtainable online, but I couldn't find it), so wouldn't you be better of burning X worth of ETC than X worth of ETH since ETC trades for so much less?

If your goal is just to have a functional application, does it matter if you use ETH or ETC?  Doesn't it just matter that the product is good?  As a consumer, why would I care if I was using an app built on ETC or ETH's platform (assuming they are the same app with same functionality)?  Is this just a bet among developers that ETH will be worth more long term, so they would rather be paid in ETH during an ICO rather than ETC (with their assumption being that ETH will have more staying power and holding ETH will be a better store of value long term)?

Anyway, if you're not aware, there's a number of Bitcoin, Etherium, and presumably other alt coin transactions that contain copyright infringing material as part of the transaction. For example, in Bitcoin, you can store messages in the coinbase string, or the transaction outputs (and maybe more). There's also projects like crypograffiti which provide a web interface to let you store and retrieve messages, including (low res) potentially copyright infringing images. 

Compared to Bitcoin, Etherium is even more lax - check out this transaction: https://www.etherchain.org/tx/0xbb8ee9866ee67277986b6f40775469c7a674810ce99dce3caff0d1117c8dcdac (I got it from here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3hx73f/freakiest_thing_ever_the_blockchain_now_has_a/) this, when converted to an mp3, plays the 'I'm sorry Dave' line taken from 2001.

Isn't this legally problematic? If I was the copyright holder of 2001, and was out to get Etherium (because, for example, I had investments in a competing coin), what on earth happens? I give a DMCA notice to everyone on the blockchain to please remove the offending content? What if instead of an mp3, which is no-doubt small time, I decide to start storing low-res CP on the blockchain? 

Using the Eth blockchain as file storage would cost hundreds of dollars per image or file at current Eth prices. But, if I had loads of dosh I could start uploading CP to the blockchain, put short-odds on Eth, and start ringing up the Feds and every news outlet in the country -- because what the hell do you do?

If there are other projects with similar qualities, I'd encourage people to throw them into the discussion too.

Neither are blockchains. Both claim to solve scalability with innovative solutions that entirely sidestep the problems with blockchain. Both are claiming to be platforms for building any kind of application. However they seem to be fundamentally different architectures, so I'm trying to understand how the different architectures will impact how applications will function on each platform.

Radix seems to have more in common with traditional blockchains in the sense that it is built for tokenization and transaction consensus, whereas Holochain calls itself ""agent-centric,"" rather than data-centric, with each user having their own individual hash-chain. They claim that data-centric approaches are inherently limited because they don't allow for freedom and versatility at the agent level.

I've been trying to wrap my head around what types of applications will be possible to build on these two platforms. I'm starting to get the impression that Turing complete is not the end of the story, that the underlying architecture makes a difference too.

For instance, I've noticed that the Ethereum DApps all seem to be focused on things you can own, like cryptokitties, or cryptocountries. The Turing completeness allows you to program this however you want, but the architecture of Ethereum, which is built for universal consensus on a data-centric blockchain, seems quite limited in scope. With that being the case, would something like Radix just be able to build better, faster versions of cryptokitties (and, of course, more useful fin-tech applications?)

Holochain, on the other hand, could its apps be more flexible? More interesting? More adaptable?

I'm not fully getting it yet, but I have the impression that Radix (or something like it) could be a leader in terms of the purely fin-tech applications, and Holochain (or something like it) could be useful for more general purpose applications that require data-integrity/security, and for building an ecosystem of applications/currencies that benefit from consistent tracking of reputation and identity (or pseudonym identity).

All existing cryptocurrencies have at most 10 years from now to become quantum-resistant, except the already quantum-resistant ones (IOTA, QRL,...). And this is only the European roadmap, a region that has been lagging behind the US and China in terms of Quantum Technologies R&amp;D. Should there be a breakthrough (even if a minor one) in this field in the next few years, a quantum computer strong enough to break Bitcoin's cryptography may come to existence earlier than most people would expect.

I have communicated with them on Twitter regarding the debit card fees and in those communications included all of my Arizona local and national elected officials.

I want to share this communication here to clarify with Coinbase and my fellow users if my understanding of the situation is accurate and if so, implore everyone to publicly ask these questions to the banks and debit card issuers (visa, mc etc), as well as your elected officials in order to affect change. Coinbase team - i will likely post this in a few different threads, not to spam you but in order to gain the most visibility. To my initial question to Chase regarding the fees I received this response:

""If the merchant in question processes the transaction as a cash-like transaction on a credit card, it would be subject to a cash advance fee of the greater between $10 or 5%. It would also be subject to interest as soon as it was processed. ^SC""

And to this I replied as follows (a little lengthy and I will post here as one complete message as opposed to the multiple tweets):

@giancarloCFTC @MarkWarner @RepMcSally @kyrstensinema @RepGosar @RepRaulGrijalva @RepAndyBiggsAZ @RepRubenGallego @RepDavid @RepOHalleran 
@SenJohnMcCain @JeffFlake @AZSenateDems @AZSenateGOP

Thank you for your reply! However it still leaves me with several questions, and one point of clarification. I am specifically referring to charges applied to a debit card, not a credit card. I have never used a credit card for digital asset purchases and it is my understanding Chase no longer allows that anyway. This means I am being charged a cash advance fee for simply making a purchase. Your reply seems to indicate that this is a choice of Coinbase (the merchant) in how they process the transaction. But my understanding is that this was a recent change to the mcc, meaning it does not have anything to do with how they ""choose"" to process it, but how the coding applied by visa, mc, etc dictates it is processed. Please correct me if my reading (or their telling) of the Coinbase statement is inaccurate:
""Recently, the MCC code for digital currency purchases was changed by a number of the major credit card networks. The new code will allow banks and card issuers to charge additional ‘cash advance’ fees. These fees aren’t charged or collected by Coinbase. These additional fees will show up as a separate line item on your card statement.

If the above statement is accurate then I understand that Chase was not directly responsible for the MCC change, but am I also correct that the ""cash advance"" fee is being collected and kept by Chase.

As your customer I would hope you would fight on my behalf against improper fees (cash advance for an asset purchase) initiated by another company, @Visa in my case. So, it is with this understanding (again, please clarify if I am incorrect about any specific points) that I am wondering:
1. Did you have any communication with @Visa regarding the MCC change or knowledge of that change prior to implementation?
2. If so, did @Chase internally support that change, remain neutral to it or fight against it on behalf of your customers
3. Do you think it is proper and legal to assess a cash advance fee on a debit card for the purchase of a legally classified asset/property.
4. Did you notify your customers of this change that resulted in increased fees? To my knowledge, I did not receive notification of newly imposed fees.
I and many others would also really like to hear some type of response from our elected officials regarding these newly imposed fees.",NA,"7x5a93",NA,0,NA,"false",1520526401,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","DEVELOPMENT","","false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/7x5a93/debit_card_cash_advance_fees_please_read/",NA,"",NA,"DEVELOPMENT","",0,1

I have wanted to participate in a blockchain/crypto for some time now. I own some altcoins and have done some mining but what im looking for is a crypto where i can contribute with a 24/7 node running on my server.  

&amp;nbsp;

What i have found so far,  
* IOTA (DAG), Here i can run a full node to help the network if i manage to get on their slack to get some neighbour nodes. But there is no reward or interest. Will attempt to run a node anyway since i want to contribute.  
* Nano (DAG), have not tried but like IOTA its a DAG chain so i should be able to participate without any initial investment. But no reward or interest.  
* Gridcoin (PoS). I have been mining GRC for some months but in order to stake regularly i would need more coins. GRC   is a good candidate to what im looking for.  
* XTRABYTES. To run a node with the current pricing i would need coins worth 100 000$... I have about 30$ worth :)  

&amp;nbsp;

Looking for a crypto that:  
* requires small coin investment  
* gives rewards/interest for keeping the node online  

&amp;nbsp;

Any advice welcome. Advice can also be a crypto that has not yet launched their nodes but will do so in the future.  

&amp;nbsp;

The problem looks to have stemmed from a replicated database (Primary to replicas). 

While this is in theory a great setup, as it keeps the site resilient, clustering in many cases has often caused more pain than it's solved.

Cloud providers can mitigate alot of this risk by providing streamlined, high-availability services. This is often a much better solution than the do-it-yourself model. However, the problem with that is you're still relying on a centralized model to handle your data and also you have to trust them to keep your infrastructure running.

There are quite a few projects out there that are trying to tackle this, both at the database layer and the physical storage layer.

A set of data distributed over thousands, even millions of nodes, is extremely resilient. The challenge here will be scaling the solution up.

If you take a look at Bitcoin's infrastructure, there is a sync time, depending on hardware, that can take a day or more to completley replicate the blockchain. Bitcoin is using a 7 year old release of Berkeley, which is only around 160GB or more.

The challenge remains, how can we:

* scale a distributed database up into the TBs and PBs?
* increase the sync time of a new node that joins the network?
* Vitalik is looking at sharding to help solve these types of issues, but that can be difficult when you're trying to create an ACID compliant data set.

I'm confident these challenges can be overcome, and we truly WILL have a ""world supercomputer,"" with a highly scalable database, within 5 years.

I was thinking how to categorize different tokens/coins/projects on Ethereum blockchain. And I have an idea to divide it into two groups: a) due to “technical” category and b) narrative characteristic. What do you think? What’s missing in your opinion? With my team, I checked more than 600 Ethereum-based projects, and I think that almost all of them would work with those tags below.

tags due to technical category

* AI
* Banking
* Education
* Energy
* Finance
* Gambling
* Gaming
* Hardware
* Health
* HR
* Legal
* Media
* Other
* Porn
* Privacy
* Protocol
* Real estate
* Retail
* Security
* Smart contract
* Sport
* Trading
* Transport
* VR
* Wallet
* Open source
* Card
* Stable coin
* Crowdfunding

b) narrative characteristic


* Great story behind - for example: 
Climate coin: The first cryptocurrency that allows everyone to participate in the fight against Climate Change. Democratizing the carbon markets through Blockchain Technology. Becoming the first carbon zero cryptocurrency in the world.

* One of the oldest projects

* Academics involved - for example Enigma https://www.trivial.co/t/0xf0ee6b27b759c9893ce4f094b49ad28fd15a23e4

* They call themselves as the first - every second project :)

* Livin’ my life like it’s golden - stable coins connected to gold 

* You can share it with your family

* Hello love! - for projects connected to porn

* Voyeurism - for projects connected to porn cameras

**I need to categorize all tokens/coins on Ethereum blockchain, so we as a project could use it inside our browser for tokens, transactions, accounts, top token holders, connections between transactions and so on.** 

You can check it by yourself:
Check tokens: https://www.trivial.co/t/ZZZ where ZZZ is a smart contract number of a token
Check account: https://www.trivial.co/profile/AAA where AAA is any account number

To expand on the title, I'm trying to find a platform that would allow me to place the coins I have vs other coins AND (very important) vs USD/EUR/etc. Furthermore, and this is the most important part, I'd like to see the history of the coins from a hypothetical year ago when I bought it to present time (again, vs both other coins and fiat)

To give you a hypothetical example:

On 10th JAN I have 1 ETH which equaled 0.10 BTC and 1000 USD at the time (and freeze it at that to show me a comparison)

Today 15th FEB I have the same 1 ETH but now it equals 0.15 BTC and 1200 USD. (even though vs BTC it increased more, vs USD it didn't as much and this is because BTC fell while USD and ETH did not)

And so on for each coin. I'm looking for something like this because (relating to the example) ETH and BTC fluctuates and BTC to USD fluctuates as well, which means that in the long run I may forget what was the value in USD of coins I bought a year ago for example.

NANO/XRB claims it can process 7000 Transactions per second, and it appears that it could do so, however with relatively low volume. 

Do you think that NANO will be able to achieve what it claims it can on the big stage? Any coin that has low volume is cheap and fast to move around, however when scaling, it becomes more costly and slower. 

I don't understand too much about the technicalities of it all, however here is an article where some tests were conducted: https://hackernoon.com/stress-testing-the-raiblocks-network-568be62fdf6d

Starting soon, we'll be hosting AMAs with various cryptocurrency teams! While we can't reveal exactly who will participate yet, we can tell you that many individuals from some of the biggest projects are already interested. This comes as an effort to kickstart discussions on /r/CryptoTechnology, all the while preserving the quality of posts and  even increasing it. All AMAs will be strictly focused on development and technology. As per our rules, any talks of market, predictions, questions relating to partnerships, low effort comments, jokes and memes are not allowed and will be removed. Lighthearted replies (if used sparingly) may be tolerated, as our goal is simply to foster intelligent dialog, not to completely crush fun interactions.

By default, as soon as the first AMAs are confirmed, they will be announced in this subreddit and will be crossposted to /r/CryptoCurrency (and, often, the team's project's sub as well), along with our rules to make sure newcomers are aware of them. Feel free to share these announcements on other subreddits if you like. To give everyone a chance to be free at the time of the AMAs, we'll try to stick to popular time slots and to announce each AMA **at least three days in advance**.

Since the dawn of odometers, there have been problems with people tampering with them to make a car appear to have fewer miles than it actually does, so the current owner can sell the car for more (evidently this has been a big scandal in the Ferrari world recently). In addition, it's not always easy to know if a car has been in an accident. Companies like Carfax have popped up and tried to address the solution, but they depend on the mechanic having access and permission to change a car's vehicle history report, and then actually doing it. If I recall correctly, shops have to pay a fee to Carfax to use their system and if they don't want to, then any work they do doesn't show up on a history report. If a car suffers damage, the owner has an incentive for the mechanic or body shop to not actually report it, so as not to hurt the car's resale value later on.


To me, this sounds like a ripe opportunity for blockchain. As advanced as cars are today, with the myriad sensors and computing power packed into each one, surely there's a way for a new car to periodically report its mileage and current status on a public ledger. In the event of a collision, the car could automatically report, ""On August 9, 2019, the car experienced a 15 G frontal collision, and the airbags deployed"", and then regardless of whether or not the car was repaired in some podunk-ass town that only has dial-up internet, there is no longer any way to hide the fact that the car was in an accident.


I started to look around to see if anyone else had come up with a similar idea, and alas it seems someone has beaten me to the punch. I found a company called VINchain that is working on this and I started reading through their whitepaper, which left me with a couple questions. 


Here's a few quotes taken from their ""How it Works"" section:

&gt; When requested, the information corresponding to the specific VIN number
will be searched, selected, and pulled into a report in the blockchain. Each
record will have information about data provider, date, VIN and use of the car.

This first quote makes it sound to me like the data is only recorded on the blockchain when requested, like from a prospective buyer? I am not well versed enough with blockchains to know about how much space would be needed for a more frequent sampling period. For example, would it be feasible for 10 million cars to upload their mileage and status daily + whenever a collision is detected? I'm a noob at this stuff, but would it be possible for cars to only upload to the blockchain and not actually store the entire history locally? Hell, does this even need to be a blockchain, or are there ways to just make an immutable database?

&gt; VINchain intends to implement a token to smooth the processing of car
information queries on the VINchain system. An end-user will pay VIN tokens
in exchange for all information related to a VIN number that is available onchain.
The information queries are designed to rely on extremely simple token
economics for the client-facing aspects of the payment system. 

Could these transactions be done with a dApp and paid for with ETH or similar instead of its own token? At what point is a blockchain necessary to do something that a dApp can't? I'm not trying to say this company doesn't need a blockchain, I'm asking because I really want to better understand the difference.


&gt; Unlike traditional vehicle history options, it will be possible for certified
mechanics and other participants in the chain of control to submit car
information that would previously have been overlooked due to lack of
insurance reporting. As more information providers are verified, VINchain will
allow for more widely crowdsourced information on vehicle histories. 

Similar to above, would this be better as an automatic process that happens in the background as opposed to requiring a human to manually enter the data? If so, could this happen on another blockchain? I'm having trouble understanding when something can be used on an existing blockchain vs. when it needs its own standalone.


The possibilities of this are exciting though. I've heard of company vehicles and police cars recording telemetry data such as an overrev event, or high-speed driving. But the same could be applied to passenger cars, like a car with a manual transmission recording the number of stalls so any future owners could know the previous driver had never driven stick when he bought the car and there's probably a clutch replacement coming soon. Or a car could tell you if the owner went 5000 miles further between oil changes than he should have (admittedly I got that idea from reading VINchains whitepaper),  or if you turn onto a road at night and are rear-ended by a driver whose lights are off, you could be found not-at-fault by definitively proving that his lights were off at the time. If you are the victim of a hit-and-run, your car and the car of the guy who hit you would have the same GPS location and both record a collision, allowing you to potentially search for the guy and file a police report based on his plates.


This is beginning to sound like a TED talk so I'll try to bring this back on track. Basically what I'm asking is, how feasible is what I've described above, and what would be needed to make it happen? I apologize if this seems too noobish or if this isn't quite the correct place to ask these questions, I'm just trying to understand and don't know where else to ask.

&gt; A quick note on terminology: sites are transactions represented on the tangle graph. The network is composed of nodes; that is, nodes are entities that issue and validate transactions

As far as I can understand, Nodes and Sites both are the same thing. But then I'm confused by the following text: - 

&gt; The transactions issued by nodes constitute the site set of the tangle graph, which is the ledger for storing transactions. The edge set of the tangle is obtained in the following way: when a new transaction arrives, it must approve two1 previous transactions. these approvals are represented by directed edges, as shown in Figure 

What I don't understand is if nodes/sites are issuing the transactions and the edge sets (which I'm assuming are the lines linking between the nodes) show the approval of the transactions, then are the nodes, sites and transactions one and the same thing? Figure link - https://imgur.com/a/kEVpU

If not, then what is the proper representation. Because the figure is not clear to me.

I remember reading a while ago about banks developing their own block chain. i didnt remember the specifics of its purposes, but since my safe portion of my portfolio is heavy remittance xrp and xlm. i got curious.

you can see here, remittance cost reduction for bad fiat pairs is a huge cost for transferring money, particulalry to africa and australia and papua niugini as a good example.

https://www.finder.com/remittance-fees-global-world, more here indepth https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2228/9780821389720.pdf

i decided to get a gauge at what they were up to, its hard because its opaque, unlike development of other coins where we have a road map. this isnt a great article but this quote really stuck out to me:

&gt; With the six banks having already signed up the coin, each will have cash value that can be instantly converted into whichever currency is necessary.

article: https://www.siliconrepublic.com/enterprise/major-banks-blockchain-cryptocurrency

advantages: 

- this skips the middle man, an irriational market fluctuating the token. so cost savings.

- easily secured via api calls with TLS. this would likely involve no tradeable tokens for people to invest in. public misses out, banks get richer.

- this kind of block chain would i guess be defined as public / private mix. private to the banks who are running the project and public to the banks who want to utilise it but not to the public in general. since its not public, but could be hacked or attacked by a , how would it be protected? i really wonder how a private block chain would operate. if anyone could expand on that. do you still need PoW or PoS to protect it? in this case PoW kinda makes no sense. but PoS gives voting rights for development.

- a block chain thats inclusive only to trusted parties, perhaps eliminates or reduces the risk of having a token, we see speculation on the markets daily and its quite irrational as fundamentals don't make sense with the price movements, crypto is extremly complex after all, a lot of misinformed investors buy coins with bad fundamentals.

my doubts about their plans

-  most devs in banks just build line of business applications, infact almost all devs do, i know because i am one, for 10 years. its not hard stuff, build a site, build an api for the site to get data from the api, the api hooks into a database and your done, more or less, there are exceptions of course but ill keep this light. in reality tho line of business application is what ive encountered my whole career. this kind of dev is easy compared to block chain development. 

- when it comes to developing a new blockchain. you cant just expect your line of business applicaton developer to build a block chain, they need fundamental understanding of how block chain tech works, they need to know languages that are applicable c++ and rust are good examples, most back end devs are java / .net / nodejs. They also need solid understanding of constructing efficent algorithms with very good knowledge of cryptography, a lot of this is hidden away in higher level langauges like java and .net, so they will likely need to head hunt devs away from block chain projects. This is a new hot industry and good tallent is thin howerver they have deep pockets, so who knows? they might be able to form a team, but its unknown. ive seen projects at banks. over budget, dont deliver on time, cost runs 2x or more from the initial out lay and dont deliver everything initially promised, bad project management. but maybe ive just been at bad banks. however IT for banks for is a cost center. its not their main focus of business, so this is why you get great software development out of these companies unless they bring in a consultancy for harder projects.


just wondering what your thoughts are on this, i see it as a threat. as a bank you either go with a mostly private block chain and dont have to worry about coin price fluctuations, perhaps its cheaper? on the other hand. you have ripple / stellar who have people there who already have a working product and its probably easier just to use that, the cost advantage may not be worth it. Also this could potentially a race against time if everyone is using xlm / xrp, their chain might not take off who knows. remittance with cryptos solves a huge a huge problems. even if the banks do this, there is still space for ripple / xlm, i suppose. i guess im in the dark, because the development of their own block chain is in house.

thoughts?

anything i missed? got wrong? any good resources on the banks have achieved thus far would be appreciated.

I'm looking into starting using crypto technology for my business, I'm pretty well versed in the subject but not sure if a single platform could meet all my needs. I manufacture hardware and planning onnhaving features such as user proposal for new hardware with a voting system. (Sort of like Lego idea)

Here are the areas where I could use crypto to decrease my costs or just have better security/transparency:

Registration/Counterfeit-protection/warranty: With every new piece of hardware, users could link their hardware to their account, ensuring that their product is authentic and under warranty. This could also provide a ledger of all units produced and production information.

Voting/Authoring: As mentioned earlier a voting system for customers to vote for user creations would be a great use of the technology. In addition those whose creations end up in production could have their account tied to their creation and automatically receive royalties every time a unit they designed sells.

Payments: It would probably be in my interest to allow for the maximum currencies as possible. I recently used a service that was pretty good: http://coinpayment.net (I used it as a customer). Fees are 0.5% which is much better than what I am paying now (Around 3%)
.
One thing that could be cool would be to integrate the voting system and payment through smart contract. For example being able to pledge an amount with a vote for a product, have it in escrow until a tracking number is issued.

I'm not sure if financing is something that could be doable, especially because of price fluctuations. 

A huge plus would be for those platforms to have a solid API or easy way to integrate with my site or have its own product that can be integrated.

What hasn't been done or should be done better?","I see a lot of talk on this sub of how some of this stuff doesn't need tokens or coins and I kind of agree. On top of that, 90% of coins are just new platforms that do it ""better"" or ""faster"". Obviously, there's some super neat cases out there like HST for voting where tokens make complete sense or stuff like NAS where we can now search the blockchain. Just for fun, I've been sitting here brainstorming, what else is left? What would be a fun, unique use for blockchain that seemingly no one (or whoever did is horrible) is tackling? Part of me would love to get involved in my own ICO or Usage, but I just haven't come up with something I actually want to pursue. So maybe this thread is also looking to steal your ideas, who knows.

I continue to look at it from an actual software/application perspective, since that's where I'm more familiar. My two thoughts were:

1. A middleman that ties into existing enterprise IT infrastructure and decentralizes some of their functions. In my mind, this would tie into something like Active Directory or Exchange where you can offload some tasks onto the blockchain and reduce the need for 50 servers to 10 or something along those lines. I don't think transaction speeds are fast enough for full tie in (i.e. a mailbox database on Exchange), but even doing some hot/cold storage seems feasible. I view it somewhat like Azure/AWS but on the software (SaaS) side. Could even target stuff like SAP.

2. EDiscovery-esque/Chain of Custody data storage. Big part of Legal discovery is data gathering, so I'm imagine an application where the law firm plugs in a few settings and send off to the client. The client runs this ""script"", that script ties into X applications database (think a mailbox or accounting records) and pulls those records, then uploading them directly into our blockchain. This guarantees the data pulled and that the data hasn't been  touched in transit and cannot be modified.

I'm sure there's a ton of holes in my ideas as my head isn't fully wrapped around blockchain tech yet, but happy to have them ripped apart.

I haven't heard much about the controversial Revised Payment Service Directive within the cryptosphere. The above link gives a pretty nice overview of some major changes in who can provide what financial services in the EU. It doesn't mention cyrptocurrencies but I want to hear you opinion on how these changes could affect cryptocurrencies within the EU.

PSD2 is controversial, its especially critiqued by the banks. Often heard criticisms are related to lacking consumer protection and suspectibility for fraud. These are the same two concers underpinning the adoption for cryptocurrencies as mainstream payment. (The lack of a neutral third party between two parties exchanging goods for money).

If the European Union would allow companies to provide financial services this might open the door for additional payments option in which cryptocurrencies could play a part. Do you think the PSD2 would provide room for cryptocurrencies to flourish or see it as a innovation in the wrong direction?

I made a comment chain in the old thread already but I am going to post this as an even shorter list than that. I will take some interesting things from this 114 page report and make it an into a smaller TL;DR comment. Most of the info that I am sharing has page numbers in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralCryptoTalk/comments/7sdxj7/lets_discuss_the_2017_global_cryptocurrency/dt4li0r/) [Here is a link to the study itself.](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/fileadmin/user_upload/research/centres/alternative-finance/downloads/2017-global-cryptocurrency-benchmarking-study.pdf)

This report was led by Dr. Garrick Hileman. It is the first research paper of its kind, which looks at the empirical picture of the crypto-currency industry as a whole; breaking down non-public data from 144 companies and individuals into four key constituents: exchanges, wallets, payments and mining. Some of the individuals overlap some of these categories, twice or more in some cases. This study primarily focuses on the evolving business ecosystem that features economic actors providing products, services and applications that involve the use of crypto-currencies. The report is to be useful to the industry itself, along with academics, policymakers, media, and anyone seeking to better understand the crypto-currency landscape. One thing to note is this report is from early 2017 and has been dated in some aspects but can still serve as a checkpoint reference. 

I will break this post into five segments: Overall, Exchanges, Wallets, Payment, Mining.
Overall, the most noticeable thing in the crypto-currency industry is becoming more fluid between exchanges and wallets. Being able to use a wallet has become easier but security and regulation compliance is likely to remain for years to come. While wallets and exchanges become merged, a crypto-currency system still exists in a vacuum. Users have to mine and acquire the native token in order to participate in the ecosystem. So while the list of merchants that accept crypto-currencies is increasing, the crypto-currencies are not being used primarily as a medium of exchange. 

The majority of exchanges (mostly small) specialize in local markets by supporting local currencies. 53% of exchanges support national currencies other than the five global reserve currencies: USD, CNY, EUR, GBP, JPY. Of the exchanges that data was collected from, about 75% of exchanges hold the private keys for users and about a third of those exchanges have a proof-of-reserve mechanism for their audit process. A centralized exchange runs risk of internal fraud and bankruptcies. This has happened many times in this space, and could be avoided with decentralized exchanges. However, P2P exchanges have yet to gain more popularity. 51 exchanges were represented in this report, of those, only 2 provide a decentralized marketplace. It was also noted that exchanges employ the most amount of people, compared to other sectors in the crypto-currency industry. 

I mentioned before that the report notes exchanges are wallets are becoming more and more ‘blurred’. Perhaps that is why we have over 3 million active, unique users. The amount of active wallets is over 6 million. The report makes note that the estimate of the number of active wallets does not include users whose exchange accounts serve as their de facto wallet to store cryptocurrencies, or users from payment services providers or other platforms that enable the storage of crypto currency. The numbers in this report act as a base but is likely to be considerably higher than their estimate of unique active wallet users.  Some also consider active wallets to be wallets owned by users that log in at least once a week; long-term holders who do not frequently transact are thus usually considered ‘inactive’. The study also puts that of all the wallets out there, only 7.5% to 30.9% are considered ‘active.’ That is roughly 2.625million to 10.815 million active wallets. When reading these numbers, it is important to realize that this is not a perfect answer and there is no way to provide an exact answer. There are no limits or number kept on who opens how many wallets. This number is to be considered conservative and the actual number will be much higher. Wallets have really evolved out of the simple software that stores private keys into sophisticated applications that offer multiple technical options and services. Interestingly, 81% of these wallets are based in North America and Europe but only 61% of the wallet users reside in these regions. All wallets that provide a centralized national-to-crypto-currency exchange services perform KYC/AML checks. Mobile wallet apps are also the most available format (65%), followed by desktop and web, but hardware wallets are last (23%). As for compliance and regulations, 40% of wallet providers indicate they perceive no existing regulations that would affect their activities. 30% see the current environment adequate and appropriate.

Payment companies can do three types of payments: National-to-National currencies using cryptos on the back end, so that the end users don’t even know that cryptos were used in the process, National-to-Crypto or vice versa, and Crypto-to-Crypto. There is a chart on page 78 that shows National-to-Crypto and vice versa is the highest transaction volume of 68% of the total transaction. There are two other charts that are in this report, one on page 76 and the other on page 81. The titles are “National Currencies Supported by Surveyed Crypto-currency Payment Companies” and Shows Urgent Challenges Currently Facing Crypto-currencies companies” respectively.  As for regulations, 40% of the payment service providers have no existing regulations issues. They would like to have more clarity in the regulations, however.

For the last segment, Mining, it has become clear that mining pools have become increasingly professionalized. Some mining pools offer customer support phone numbers and additional services. It is also interesting that 70% of large miners say they have very high to high influence on the protocol development. Three-quarters of all major mining pools are based in just two countries: China and US: 58% and 16% of mining pools surveyed in China and US respectively. There is a large portion of miners that are not disclosed, however, and could change the balance of these numbers. Remember, this is not 100% accurate, only a snippet of the data that they gathered.  There is a chart on page 92 that shows the largest pools computational power over the four quarters of 2016. As for regulation, a slight majority of individual miners from other [than Asia-Pacific] regions indicate they would like to see cryptocurrencies being treated as a currency for tax purposes. There is a table on page 98 that shows “Legal/Regulatory Risk Factors rated by Miners”.  Large miners are least worried about a potential government ban of cryptocurrencies. Most miners are aware of the PoW issue, that consuming 10.41 TWh per year is not environmentally friendly. However, 44% and 64% of small and large miner, respectively, believe that cryptocurrency mining represents a minor issue when compared to the environmental damage caused by the extraction of fossil fuels and mining of precious metals. They are also concerned about the centralization of hashing power that could effectively undermine the censorship-resistance property that is considered an essential feature of many cryptocurrencies. There is an interesting chart on page 104 that shows fees over the years; 2015-2016 shows it increased from $2.3 million to $13.6 million of 591%.

Interested in starting up a little project and wanting to know if it's possible to be able to do the below based on blockchain technology.  
Appreciate any insightful responses as to whether it is viable to use this type of tech.

 - Is it possible to correlate a registered user of a database with the how many coins/tokens they have sent to an address?
For example: I will have an address that will have multiple users sending various amounts of coins to this address.  Is there a way to track who and how many and correlate to a registered user on my site?  What would be the cleanest way to do this from a front end perspective and therefore requiring the least amount of code to make this work?

- There will be multiple projects that users will be sending tokens for.  Is there a way to track which tokens are from a user is assigned to which project?  For example  - user1 sends 100 coins to project A and only 50 coins to project B.  How would I be able to filter this easily and is it possible? I was dreading the thought of creating multiple coin types for different projects. One coin to be used for all projects would be ideal.

I'm not a developer or coder and am just a guy with an idea.  Be really grateful if someone with some tech background could advise.

Thanks.

So this would be somewhat like atomic swaps, but with only one party involved. Upon transfering, their ETH would get locked up in a smart contract, and a corresponding amount of X_ETH would be created on the X blockchain at a given address that the user can access.

That part is easy, as X can be developed so that it can examine the Ethereum contract to confirm the locked ETH.

The problem is exchanging X_ETH back to ETH. I can't figure out whether it's possible to unlock the ETH on Ethereum just with a transaction on X. Obviously Ethereum smart contracts can't examine data on another blockchain. Would it be possible that the X protocol reveals a key to the locked ETH when the transaction is made?

basically the title, this paper is fantastic, everyone should read this before evaluating a coin and if it requires a block chain to solve a problem. many of these coins are using the block chain to solve a problem that can be more efficiently solved using tradtional technology. github is a perfect example, an immutable ledger can be provided by a traditional database. This paper was posted to me in a comment, but i think it deserves its own post.

I had coins which i think do not require a block chain or simply coins that are looking to solve a problem that does not exist with the block chain. I think MOD is a good example of the first case where it does not need a block chain but is a real problem needing a solution. Dentacoin is an example of using a block chain to solve a problem that is dubious if it even exists. i used to own mod but decided to sell it after i came to the relisation that a block chain is not needed, this was before the paper. but this articulates it so well.

Here is the summary, maybe for someone it will be helpful. My goal is to describe every specific consensus briefly so everyone can easily understand it. *Please let me know if I have wrote something wrong, or maybe you are aware of interesting algorithm, I have missed.

[Proof of Work] - very short, cuz it's well-known.

[1] Bitcoin - to generate a new block miner must generate hash of the new block header that is in line with given requirements.

Others: Ethereum, Litecoin etc.

[Hybrid of PoW and PoS]

[2] Decred - hybrid of “proof of work” and “proof of stake”. Blocks are created about every 5 minutes. Nodes in the network looking for a solution with a known difficulty to create a block (PoW). Once the solution is found it is broadcast to the network. The network then verifies the solution. Stakeholders who have locked some DCR in return for a ticket* now have the chance to vote on the block (PoS). 5 tickets are chosen pseudo-randomly from the ticket pool and if at least 3 of 5 vote ‘yes’ the block is permanently added to the blockchain. Both miners and voters are compensated with DCR : PoS - 30% and PoW - 60% of about 30 new Decred issued with a block. * 1 ticket = ability to cast 1 vote. Stakeholders must wait an average of 28 days (8,192 blocks) to vote their tickets. 

[Proof of Stake]

[3] Nxt - The more tokens are held by account, the greater chance that account will earn the right to generate a block. The total reward received as a result of block generation is the sum of the transaction fees located within the block. Three values are key to determining which account is eligible to generate a block, which account earns the right to generate a block, and which block is taken to be the authoritative one in times of conflict: base target value, target value and cumulative difficulty. Each block on the chain has a generation signature parameter. To participate in the block's forging process, an active account digitally signs the generation signature of the previous block with its own public key. This creates a 64-byte signature, which is then hashed using SHA256. The first 8 bytes of the resulting hash are converted to a number, referred to as the account hit. The hit is compared to the current target value(active balance). If the computed hit is lower than the target, then the next block can be generated.

[4] Peercoin (chain-based proof of stake) - coin age parameter. Hybrid PoW and PoS algorithm. The longer your Peercoins have been stationary in your account (to a maximum of 90 days), the more power (coin age) they have to mint a block. The act of minting a block requires the consumption of coin age value, and the network determines consensus by selecting the chain with the largest total consumed coin age. Reward - minting + 1% yearly.

[5] Reddcoin (Proof of stake Velocity) - quite similar to Peercoin, difference: not linear coin-aging function (new coins gain weight quickly, and old coins gain weight increasingly slowly) to encourage Nodes Activity. Node with most coin age weight have a bigger chance to create block. To create block Node should calculate right hash. Block reward - interest on the weighted age of coins/ 5% annual interest in PoSV phase.

[6] Ethereum (Casper) - uses modified BFT consensus. Blocks will be created using PoW. In the Casper Phase 1 implementation for Ethereum, the “proposal mechanism"" is the existing proof of work chain, modified to have a greatly reduced block reward. Blocks will be validated by set of Validators. Block is finalised when 2/3 of validators voted for it (not the number of validators is counted, but their deposit size). Block creator rewarded with Block Reward + Transaction FEES.

[7] Lisk (Delegated Proof-of-stake) - Lisk stakeholders vote with vote transaction (the weight of the vote depends on the amount of Lisk the stakeholder possess) and choose 101 Delegates, who create all blocks in the blockchain. One delegate creates 1 block within 1 round (1 round contains 101 blocks) -&gt; At the beginning of each round, each delegate is assigned a slot indicating their position in the block generation process -&gt; Delegate includes up to 25 transactions into the block, signs it and broadcasts it to the network -&gt; As &gt;51% of available peers agreed that this block is acceptable to be created (Broadhash consensus), a new block is added to the blockchain. *Any account may become a delegate, but only accounts with the required stake (no info how much) are allowed to generate blocks. Block reward - minted Lisks and transaction fees (fees for all 101 blocks are collected firstly and then are divided between delegates). Blocks appears every 10 sec.

[8] Cardano (Ouroboros Proof of Stake) - Blocks(slots) are created by Slot Leaders. Slot Leaders for N Epoch are chosen during n-1 Epoch. Slot Leaders are elected from the group of ADA stakeholders who have enough stake. Election process consist of 3 phases: Commitment phase: each elector generates a random value (secret), signs it and commit as message to network (other electors) saved in to block. -&gt; Reveal phase: Each elector sends special value to open a commitment, all this values (opening) are put into the block. -&gt; Recovery phase: each elector verifies that commitments and openings match and extracts the secrets and forms a SEED (randomly generated bytes string based on secrets). All electors get the same SEED. -&gt; Follow the Satoshi algorithm : Elector who have coin which corresponded to SEED become a SLOT LEADER and get a right to create a block. Slot Leader is rewarded with minted ADA and transactions Fee.

[9] Tezos (Proof Of Stake) - generic and self-amending crypto-ledger. At the beginning of each cycle (2048 blocks), a random seed is derived from numbers that block miners chose and committed to in the penultimate cycle, and revealed in the last. -&gt; Using this random seed, a follow the coin strategy (similar to Follow The Satoshi) is used to allocate mining rights and signing rights to stakeholders for the next cycle*. -&gt; Blocks are mined by a random stakeholder (the miner) and includes multiple signatures of the previous block provided by random stakeholders (the signers). 
Mining and signing both offer a small reward but also require making a one cycle safety deposit to be forfeited in the event of a double mining or double signing.
* the more coins (rolls) you have - the more your chance to be a miner/signer.

[10] Tendermint (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) - A proposal is signed and published by the designated proposer at each round. The proposer is chosen by a deterministic and non-choking round robin selection algorithm that selects proposers in proportion to their voting power. The proposer create the block, that should be validated by &gt;2/3 of Validators, as follow: Propose -&gt; Prevote -&gt; Precommit -&gt; Commit. Proposer rewarded with Transaction FEES.

[11] Tron (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) - This blockhain is still on development stage. Consensus algorithm = PoS + BFT (similar to Tendermint): PoS algorithm chooses a node as Proposer, this node has the power to generate a block. -&gt; Proposer broadcasts a block that it want to release. -&gt; Block enters the Prevote stage. It takes &gt;2/3 of nodes' confirmations to enter the next stage. -&gt; As the block is prevoted, it enters Precommit stage and needs &gt;2/3 of node's confirmation to go further. -&gt; As &gt;2/3 of nodes have precommited the block it's commited to the blockchain with height +1. New blocks appears every 15 sec.

[12] NEO (Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance) - Consensus nodes* are elected by NEO holders -&gt; The Speaker is identified (based on algorithm) -&gt; He broadcasts proposal to create block -&gt; Each Delegate (other consensus nodes) validates proposal -&gt; Each Delegate sends response to other Delegates -&gt; Delegate reaches consensus after receiving 2/3 positive responses -&gt; Each Delegate signs the block and publishes it-&gt; Each Delegate receives a full block. Block reward 6 GAS distributed proportionally in accordance with the NEO holding ratio among NEO holders. Speaker rewarded with transaction fees (mostly 0). * Stake 1000 GAS to nominate yourself for Bookkeeping(Consensus Node)

[13] EOS (Delegated Proof of Stake) - those who hold tokens on a blockchain adopting the EOS.IO software may select* block producers through a continuous approval voting system and anyone may choose to participate in block production and will be given an opportunity to produce blocks proportional to the total votes they have received relative to all other producers. At the start of each round 21 unique block producers are chosen. The top 20 by total approval are automatically chosen every round and the last producer is chosen proportional to their number of votes relative to other producers. Block should be confirmed by 2/3 or more of elected Block producers. Block Producer rewarded with Block rewards. *the more EOS tokens a stakeholder owns, the greater their voting power

[The XRP Ledger Consensus Process]

[14] Ripple - Each node receives transaction from external applications -&gt; Each Node forms public list of all valid (not included into last ledger (=block)) transactions aka (Candidate Set) -&gt; Nodes merge its candidate set with UNLs(Unique Node List) candidate sets and vote on the veracity of all transactions (1st round of consensus) -&gt; all transactions that received at least 50% votes are passed on the next round (many rounds may take place) -&gt; final round of consensus requires that min 80% of Nodes UNL agreeing on transactions. It means that at least 80% of Validating nodes should have same Candidate SET of transactions -&gt; after that each Validating node computes a new ledger (=block) with all transactions (with 80% UNL agreement) and calculate ledger hash, signs and broadcasts -&gt; All Validating nodes compare their ledgers hash -&gt; Nodes of the network recognize a ledger instance as validated when a 80% of the peers have signed and broadcast the same validation hash. -&gt; Process repeats. Ledger creation process lasts 5 sec(?). Each transaction includes transaction fee (min 0,00001 XRP) which is destroyed. No block rewards.

[The Stellar consensus protocol]

[15] Stellar (Federated Byzantine Agreement) - quit similar to Ripple. Key difference - quorum slice.

[Proof of Burn]

[16] Slimcoin - to get the right to write blocks Node should “burn” amount of coins. The more coins Node “burns” more chances it has to create blocks (for long period) -&gt; Nodes address gets a score called Effective Burnt Coins that determines chance to find blocks. Block creator rewarded with block rewards.

[Proof of Importance]

[17] NEM - Only accounts that have min 10k vested coins are eligible to harvest (create a block). Accounts with higher importance scores have higher probabilities of harvesting a block. The higher amount of vested coins, the higher the account’s Importance score. And the higher amount of transactions that satisfy following conditions: - transactions sum min 1k coins, - transactions made within last 30 days, - recipient have 10k vested coins too, - the higher account’s Important score. Harvester is rewarded with fees for the transactions in the block. A new block is created approx. every 65 sec.

[Proof of Devotion]

[18] Nebulas (Proof of Devotion + BFT) - quite similar to POI, the PoD selects the accounts with high influence.  All accounts are ranked according to their liquidity and propagation (Nebulas Rank) -&gt; Top-ranked accounts are selected -&gt; Chosen accounts pay deposit and are qualified as the blocks Validators* -&gt; Algorithm pseudo-randomly chooses block Proposer -&gt; After a new block is proposed, Validators Set (each Validator is charged a deposit) participate in a round of BFT-Style voting to verify block (1. Prepare stage -&gt; 2. Commit Stage. Validators should have &gt; 2/3 of total deposits to validate Block) -&gt; Block is added. Block rewards : each Validator rewarded with 1 NAS.
*Validators Set is dynamic, changes in Set may occur after Epoch change. 

[IOTA Algorithm]

[19] IOTA - uses DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) instead of blockchain (TANGLE equal to Ledger). Graph consist of transactions (not blocks). To issue a new transaction Node must approve 2 random other Transactions (not confirmed). Each transaction should be validate n(?) times. By validating PAST(2) transactions whole Network achieves Consensus. in Order to issue transaction Node: 1. Sign transaction with private key 2. choose two other Transactions to validate based on MCMC(Markov chain Monte Carlo) algorithm, check if 2 transactions are valid (node will never approve conflicting transactions) 3. make some PoW(similar to HashCash). -&gt; New Transaction broadcasted to Network. Node don’t receive reward or fee.

[PBFT + PoW]

[20] Yobicash - uses PBFT and also PoW. Nodes reach consensus on transactions by querying other nodes. A node asks its peers about the state of a transaction: if it is known or not, and if it is a doublespending transaction or not. As follow : Node receives new transaction -&gt; Checks if valid -&gt; queries all known nodes for missing transactions (check if already in DAG ) -&gt; queries 2/3 nodes for doublepsending and possibility -&gt; if everything is ok add to DAG. Reward - nodes receive transaction fees + minting coins. 

[Proof of Space/Proof of Capacity]

[21] Filecoin (Power Fault Tolerance) - the probability that the network elects a miner(Leader) to create a new block (it is referred to as the voting power of the miner) is proportional to storage currently in use in relation to the rest of the network. Each node has Power - storage in use verified with Proof of Spacetime by nodes. Leaders extend the chain by creating a block and propagating it to the network. There can be an empty block (when no leader). A block is committed if the majority of the participants add their weight on the chain where the block belongs to, by extending the chain or by signing blocks. Block creator rewarded with Block reward + transaction fees.

[Proof of Elapsed Time]

[22] Hyperledger Sawtooth - Goal - to solve BFT Validating Nodes limitation. Works only with intel’s SGX. PoET uses a random leader election model or a lottery based election model based on SGX, where the protocol randomly selects the next leader to finalize the block. Every validator requests a wait time from an enclave (a trusted function). -&gt; The validator with the shortest wait time for a particular transaction block is elected the leader. -&gt; The BlockPublisher is responsible for creating candidate blocks to extend the current chain. He takes direction from the consensus algorithm for when to create a block and when to publish a block. He creates, Finalizes, Signs Block and broadcast it -&gt; Block Validators check block -&gt; Block is created on top of blockchain. 

[Other]

[23] Byteball (Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance) - only verified nodes are allowed to be Validation nodes (list of requirements https://github.com/byteball/byteball-witness). Users choose in transaction set of 12 Validating nodes. Validating nodes(Witnesses) receive transaction fees.   

[24] Nano - uses DAG, PoW (HashCash). Nano uses a block-lattice structure. Each account has its own blockchain (account-chain) equivalent to the account’s transaction/balance history. To add transaction user should make some HashCash PoW -&gt; When user creates transaction Send Block appears on his blockchain and Receive block appears on Recipients blockchain. -&gt; Peers in View receive Block -&gt; Peers verify block (Double spending and check if already in the ledger) -&gt; Peers achieve consensus and add block.
In case of Fork (when 2 or more signed blocks reference the same previous block):  Nano network resolves forks via a  balance-weighted voting system where representative nodes vote for the block they observe, as &gt;50% of weighted votes received, consensus achieved and block is retained in the Node’s ledger (block that lose the vote is discarded). 

[25] Holochain - uses distributed hash table (DHT). Instead of trying to manage global consensus for every change to a huge blockchain ledger, every participant has their own signed hash chain. In case of multi-party transaction, it is signed to each party's chain. Each party signs the exact same transaction with links to each of their previous chain entries. After data is signed to local chains, it is shared to a DHT where every neighbor node validate it.
Any consensus algorithms can be built on top of Holochain.

[26] Komodo ('Delegated' Delayed Proof of Work (dPoW)) - end-to-end blockchain solutions. DPoW consensus mechanism does not recognize The Longest Chain Rule to resolve a conflict in the network, instead the dPoW looks to backups it inserted previously into the chosen PoW blockchain. The process of inserting backups of Komodo transactions into a secure PoW is “notarization.” Notarisation is performed by the elected Notary nodes. Roughly every ten minutes, the Notary nodes perform a special block hash mined on the Komodo blockchain and take note of the overall Komodo blockchain “height”. The notary nodes process this specifc block so that their signatures are cryptographically included within the content of the notarized data. There are sixty-four “Notary nodes” elected by a stake-weighted vote, where ownership of KMD represents stake in the election. They are a special type of blockchain miner, having certain features in their underlying code that enable them to maintain an effective and cost-efcient blockchain and they periodically receives the privilege to mine a block on “easy difculty.”

This being totally dumb, it of course took off. 

Today someone misused an overflow bug to drain the wallet of all of its funds. This got me started thinking; how do we protect legitimate contracts from this and isn't it time to use languages that have things like overflow protection build in?

I was just talking with some friends over the weekend and we got to discussing privacy coins. We had a lot of back and forth, but ultimately we agreed on a few things:

1. Regulation in crypto is inevitable and imminent. 
2. Privacy coins are most likely to get hit with hard regulation. 
3. Fiat bridge ins and outs will be more difficult for privacy coins. 
4. There will always be privacy coins which persevere in some capacity

To add to that, to me it seems that privacy coins have an uphill battle to overcome. I believe they will always exist in one capacity or another as they serve a unique service which will always be in demand. However I am worried that in the future bigger exchanges might face legal trouble if they allow trading for privacy coins, or that platforms such as Coinbase will refuse to serve you if they can track back users utilization of privacy coins.

What are your thoughts on privacy coins and their future? Do me and my friends have a good argument or are we missing a piece of the puzzle? Just curious to see what this sub's sentiment is on the topic. 

Full disclosure I hold about 10% Monero. I also do not think any of this will be happening short term - but with crypto you never know.

I have created a channel, which will help you learn about the blockchain in a practical way. 

The videos currently on youtube are not enough in my opinion, and those which are, they ask you to pay. 

To clarify, this is for programmers mainly.

Videos currently released:

- Hashing - With practical code
- General Overview of Encryption - With code
- A review of Credits ICO and how a hacker would break into their Alpha product. For those that do not know, Credits used Math.Random() and the current date, to generate the Private key. They then hashed the private key in order to get the public key. The hashing algorithm used throughout was MD5.

Channel is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esKd9NF2uq8

- $250 USD payment in ETH for freelance style-work that will consist of a few hours researching and writing relevant crypto material. An offer is extended to r/cryptotechnology users for 50% upfront payment, but please don't try to abuse this as I'll know and the offer will be quickly be withdrawn.

- I have intentionally not included extensive details, as this personal project of mine is currently in an experimental phase, and I only want people who are *legitimately* interest in cryptocurrencies and their attendant technology.

I am looking for writers of a certain calibre (I promise you will be paid well in return):

- the ideal candidate is a uni student or ex uni student 
- you'll be provided an area to research, and you'll be paid to write a few thousand words on the task
- your work **must** adhere to strict academic writing standards, i.e. formal language. Again -- being able to at least write to acceptable academic standards is a must.
- therefore, proficiency in the English language is a bare minimum -- unless you happen to be very knowledgeable in a particular area, in which case the language requirement is much lower 

- understanding of crypto basics (PoW, PoS, importance of decentralisation etc.) Is assumed. 
- Some understanding of moderate level concepts such as sharding, ring sigs, zsnarks, Merkle trees, is expected, but you don't have to be  an expert in any of them,; as long as you can quickly digest complex papers and present the  major concepts in relatively simple language, that  is all I need.
- any actual professionals or experts in computer science, etc. I would love to talk to you if you're interested. 
- coders and devs: big plus
- also a big plus for anyone in finance, economic, business, science, engineering and healthcare fields. Basically: anyone with a brain, spare time and who wants to make easy money! (Paid in ETH). Oh and youll also need telegram for communication.

If you have questions, pm me :) if you want to apply, pm me a short paragraph explaining 2-3 pros and 2-3 cons of a coin/tech of your choice.

In POW, validators get chosen proportional to their hash rate. In POS, validators get chosen proportional to their account balance.
Can we have the validators chosen pseudo-randomly. From what I understand, given the same seed, random generators produce the same sequence of numbers. So given a seed based on the previous transaction, and a list of all nodes in system, we can apply the output of the random generator to the list of nodes and select the nodes that will act as validator for current round. And all nodes can do this calculation deterministically without any need for message-passing.

So is this even possible?

I'm not--I hold neither Steem nor Nano, and I don't intend on buying either.

People tout Nano as some revolutionary project because of its fast, scalable, and free transactions. Yet Steem has been doing this for months without much hype? They have more transactions/day that any cryptocurrency in the world (at peak they hit 2 millions in a day https://blocktivity.info/ ) and transfers don't require any kind of fee. They scale a lot further than this thanks to Graphene, and people already use it to pay content creators showing how an inflationary currency works great. Their transfers are instant (1-3 seconds just like Nano), and they proved themselves in the wild already (also Graphene was stress tested at 3k tps.) Further, they are using a blockchain which has been time-tested to be secure unlike DAG.

As a bonus, there are many dapps already built on Steem (d.tube, dsound.audio, dlive.io, busy.org, steepshot.io, steemit.com) that have more activity than all Ethereum apps combined.

What exactly does Nano solve that Steem doesn't already? I'm just very confused why DAG is necessary. The only two honest advantages I could find:

- Nano is marketed as a currency (no technological benefit; a Graphene-based currency coin would eliminate this advantage)
- Nano ledger is easier to prune and thus it's easier to host a node

Surely these are not the only advantages of using Nano and its DAG?

I thought in general the tech focused discussion on the coin would warrant a post here.

I had some questions about oyster, was unable to get them from reddit, so reached out to oyster tech telegram and managed to get Bruno. Here are the first round of questions I asked him, with his response, I had some follow up questions based on his answers which you can see below that.

My questions:

&gt; hi Bruno, I have some questions for the developers / people running the oyster project. I think you missed this from the chat, id appreciate it if you could answer these questions i have, the reddit oyster sub I think would find it interesting.

&gt; I read the white paper and was sold on the web monetisation to remove ads. 

&gt; - I would like to know how the javascript implementation of the treasure hunting PoW algorithm will be implemented. I looked into the github repo and saw the use of webworkers so that’s great, can utilise threading, multi cores and gpu. However, how will the algorithm be implemented so that it does not chew too much CPU? javascript running in the browser has no knowledge of the hardware or system processes and cpu usage. So i presume there must be something in the algorithm to determine the speed of PoW and throttle it as needed so it satisfies 3%. 

&gt; - However, I see data storage as being required to provide funding into the system, so that web owners are paid. or am i mistaken?

&gt; - With the data storage, it evaporates after a year, so even if its cheaper than google drive etc, why would i want to use data that evaporates after a year?

&gt; - The project roadmap has web hosting on the tangle as part of the project road map for 2018. This raised eyebrows for me, as a dev i've use Azure and AWS. the services provided there are quite rich. everything is centralised so there are no issues with latency with grabbing data from your storage. How can oyster compete with AWS and Azure, i get the feeling that the sites that will / if be hosted on oyster will be relegated to sites that are not very rich in functionality. I run a Product as a Service site (PaaS) which is built on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) site on azure, with this service I don’t need to worry about maintiang a server, resources are provided as required. thats just some of the services provided. I dont see how oyster can compete with that. even if it is cheaper without the services. I wouldn't bother, because im a dev, i dont want to have to sort out difficult problems with hosting, i need it to be simple so i can focus on coding. Azure gives me this.

&gt; - Following on from the above point, webhosting on the tangle implies using the data stored on the tangle (or am i mistaken?) what about issues with latency here, if your data is spread throughout the tangle, it will be slow. What if i want to run a database, will oyster support this?

&gt; - Again with the data storage, i saw a price comparison between google drive and similar services. oyster was much cheaper in theory, we shall see when there is a working product.

&gt; - I may be mistaken here, but it seems like oyster is trying to solve too many problems at once. why not just stick to web monetisation without the data storage and web hosting? or does it all fit together somehow.
Thanks


his response:

&gt; 1. Something I call a fragile loop. A time sensitive loop iterates indefinately, if a cycle of the loop is late by xyz milliseconds the PoW is scaled back. The loop itself might be rendering graphics or performing very light calculations etc, so that it can get affected by a fully loaded browser.

&gt; 2. Yes, PRL that is paid as storage eventually reaches broker nodes and website owners at around a 55:45 rate. SHL is different, the vast majority of the revenue stream is earned by website owners. SHL revenue comes from people paying for connectivity.

&gt; 3. Data has an increased risk of evaporating after whatever amount of years you choose. You could choose 10 years of guaranteed storage, and after that the data will still persist but overtime the risk of it getting purged increases. So you could pay for 5 years and in actuality the data expires in 8 years. You can also extend the guaranteed lifespan of data by sending PRL to the buried addresses, the intelligent wrapper will be useful for managing this. It’s a given that data must eventually expire off of a storage platform if payments are no longer coming in, this is true of dropbox etc.

&gt; 4. I’ve never made the case that Oyster will be cheaper, in fact I expect it to carry a premium over centralized solutions. Don’t get fooled by the tongue-in-cheek infographic floating around that is belittling the current market evaluation. Oyster will deliver an entire ecosystem that enables data hosting/data transmission/revenue generation, all the things you mentioned about Azure/AWS are applicable to Oyster. It scales ‘instances’ up/down automatically without requiring interpretation of the dev, latency bottlenecks will be your NIC. It wont be delivered overnight but it’s part of the planned ecosystem, so I’m not sure what advantages you think AWS/Azure have afterall. Wait for them to shutdown your account for TOS violation or your bank screws up a payment, then you’ll see why it’s better to migrate all of these features to a decentralized platform. I remember someone lost a lot of important data on digital ocean because of a billing error: https://murze.be/today-digitalocean-lost-our-entire-server along with another incident.

&gt; 5. tangle storage is best for long term static storage, like serving videos etc. I’m not sure why you expect the latency to be slow. Oyster will support databases, it it will probably work like using the tangle for the HDD and the meshnet for RAM/CPU.

&gt; 6. wink wink the market is irrational

&gt; 7. The data storage part is needed for the web monetization to work, so web hosting capabilities exist anyways. The entire ecosystem will come full circle until it doesn’t depend on third parties like centralized ISPs.


Round 2 questions:

&gt; Hi Bruno, I have some follow up questions, I realise you are probably very busy with the SHL questions on telegram, if you find the time I and the oyster subreddit would really appreciate it. I have 4 follow up questions based on your prior response, answers will be provided in the Oyster sub.

&gt; 1. In your response you wrote: ""All the things you mentioned about Azure/AWS are applicable to Oyster. It scales ‘instances’ up/down automatically without requiring interpretation of the dev, latency bottlenecks will be your NIC."". 
How is it possible to scale out/up/down instances without knowing about the bottle necks? On azure services will scale out based on cpu and other characteristics. Azure/AWS provides Infrastructure as a service IaaS, which allows Platform as a service PaaS. how can oyster compete with this? on later reflection on your answer, you said this will all come full circle, and i realise that doing all this in a 2018 road map is a huge hurdle. so by your initial answer, it sounds like this is on the horizon. 

&gt; 2. ""tangle storage is best for long term static storage, like serving videos etc. I’m not sure why you expect the latency to be slow"". 
I presumed that data hosted would be fragmented within the tangle, so thats where i think latency and bandwidth could be a problem, google drive is very fast in comparison. can you expand upon why latency will not be an issue if data is fragmented throughout the tangle.

&gt; 3. What about adblokers blocking the script? i had a thought about it, currently adblockers just block ad domains, easy. you can can already do this in your host file on windows. but what ad blockers blocking js ""mining"" algos. i think the job of an adblocker to go hunting for the script would be easy in its current form. However the script file can be renamed, code obfuscated and mixed in with application logic to make the job of an adblocker basically an ""anti virus"" looking for heuristics to detect mining, to shut it down, if mixed with application logic this would bring the site down. An adblocker doing would be a big job and probably chew up CPU, also adblockers provide a free service vs oyster which is for profit, so the arms race is in the favour of oyster, but im not sure its possible to mix app logic and prl protocol. if u have thoughts on this that would be great

&gt; 4. When will your team have a working product to use the javascipt code on their site? I think this was provided somewhere but i cant remember the date. Regardless an update would be nice for people to see who don't follow the project closely. any further details on the roll out of the working product would be highly appreciated.

&gt; Thanks Bruno really appreciate you taking the time to answer these


Answers from Bruno:

&gt; 1. The autoscaling won’t necessarily be ready in 2018, it works with a decentralized application that uses the meshnet for execution as needed. You should read the SHL whitepaper to learn more about how calculations are performed on the Oyster meshnet.

&gt; 2. The data is fragmented and exists as many redundant copies on the tangle, latency is measured for when the first copy of the data fragment arrives. Data redundancy constantly changes on the swarm intelligent tangle to make way for scalability. Therefore the real-world latency will constantly change but faces the same physical limitations as centralized datacenters. If the needle is in a larger amount of hay it’s going to take more time to find the needle one way or another.

&gt; 3. It’s unlikely adblockers will use complex pattern matching algorithms to try and block mining scripts because of the CPU work you had mentioned. Despite this adblockers can block all they want, in the end visitors will demand solutions like Oyster to replace the advertisements that have been forced on them without consent. Look at salon.com as a model for what will happen, instead of a paywall asking for adblocker disabled or $9.99 monthly subscription, content websites will offer the choice for mining scripts to be used instead. Overtime the internet will reach a consensus on mining scripts becoming the new solution to the currently broken internet economy.

&gt; 4. Around April or so, for mainnet. Mainnet will be the first time real PRL is used in the system.

Id like to also mention that u really need to read the SHL and Oyster white paper and understand this. the latency answer will make more sense in SHL. The oyster white paper is a prerequisite, it says it should be read briefly in the paper, but imo it should be stated more strongly. knowing how the tangle works with oyster, is fundamental to understanding SHL. 

I do view this as a risky project, its a small portion of my portfolio, what initially got me hooked was web monetisation, but a requirement for people to buy the data to provide monetisation of ads for web owners gave me doubts. Especially the web hosting in the road map really got me questioning the project. It's risky also because it depends on success of IOTA, they still haven't given a time line of when they will remove to coordinator, but researching into it, its not a deal breaker. it will be eventually removed but slowly phased out. time will tell. like oyster, IOTA is not a working product yet so theres no adoption, thus risky.","","83k02n",NA,0,NA,"false",1522286483,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","TRADING","noflair","false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/83k02n/i_had_a_qa_with_bruno_head_architect_ceo_of/","","",NA,"TRADING","",0,1

Maybe that's a naive question, but here it is: why do we [limit ourselves to 2048 words for bip 39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki)?

Reminder: bip 39 is the document that describes how mnemonics (groups of words, often 12 or 24) are transformed into seed.

By using a 2048 words list, it means we need 24 words to encode 256 bits of entropy. However, remembering 24 arbitrary words is not so simple. If you could use a list twice that long, we would only need 12 words for the same entropy.

I know the word list was selected to have nice properties, such as removal of similar words, but could'nt it be possible to generate a 4096 words list, or even more? It seems to me it would be easier to remember six words, even complicated words, than twenty four simpler words.","","83nnun",NA,0,NA,"false",1522288597,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","DEVELOPMENT","Warning-level1","false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/83nnun/why_not_increase_the_size_of_the_wordlist_in_bip39/","","7 - 8 years account age. 400 - 800 comment karma.",NA,"DEVELOPMENT","",0,0

I tried researching it, but wasn't sold.","I tried to research the differences, but i dont really see anything that makes it a huge selling point over NEO in particular, and ethereum is improving with a solid road map, plasma and sharding for example. 

In terms of consensus, I see that EOS is using dPoS, but eth is moving to PoS anyway, NEO uses dBFT which is faster anyway. On that note, is dPoS dangerous? delegating block creation to a few nodes makes me wonder if changes to EOS may be hard to implement e.g. a delegate decides they don't like risking a hard fork, or is this a moot point and not a risk with dPoS?

What EOS has is 0 transaction fees, so thats a good pro in their book. they also talk about the async nature of their dApp communication with transactions. but who cares? i think this pattern is easily implemented in other dApp protocols, i think its analogous to async / await patterns you see in programming langauges .net and the new ECMA standard, im sure other langauges have the same thing. 

I noticed that EOS is limiting the ""chattyness"" on there launch, dApps can only have 40 messages in a transaction (i read this last night, so i'm probably not articulating this correctly). This seems to be a way to ensure the network is not bogged down by dApps, but i dont think its the right way to go about it. I think allowing off chain processing like ethereum is planning with plasma much better. thats just my thinking, i could be way off, so correct me if im wrong.

On that note of chattyness, how is cpu, transactions, memory usage controlled to handle the network? we have GAS in ethereum. How does it work in EOS? I couldn't find an answer.

When it comes to programming languages, im not too fussed, they are promoting that their languages in EOS compile into c++, which is great. but solidity has great performance too. Infact, i think the programming languages available to build a dApp is over rated as a selling point. you can compile into native with many languages. You do have the special case with functional langauges like Haskell in Cardano, functional langauges generally lead to code that has less bugs, much steeper learning curve than imperative languages however, but i dont see that as being a problem.

Overall, I don't see massive pros in EOS vs NEO and Ethereum (with its upcoming changes). Cardano i mentioned because it has a great white paper, but at this stage they havent delivered much and might be too late.

I know this is a DYOR, but whats the rollout like for EOS? I don't believe its a working product yet, while NEO and Eth are. The thing with smart contracts protocols is that they can just implement ideas from other smart contract coins, however its always good to have these from the begining, to avoid forks. But even so i think the network effect of Eth and NEO will dominate the space unless EOS and Cardano can get in quick with a good use case to use them as a dApp platform, as NEO and Eth will improve over time. Of course people could migrate their dApp later when a better smart contract platform comes around. but i imagine thats not easy when you've already established yourself on one dApp platform (am i wrong?)

thoughts? I'm scratching my head at why it just blew up. Doesnt seem to offer anything mind blowing over existing working product smart contract coins.","","86wfhl",NA,0,NA,"false",1522351989,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","DEVELOPMENT","noflair","false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/86wfhl/noticed_the_huge_rise_of_eos_lately_what_does_it/","","",NA,"DEVELOPMENT","",0,1

I tried posting this in /r/CryptoCurrency yesterday but unfortunately it didn't rise. I thought that maybe this could be the place for an interesting discussion about this overview I made. I want to encourage thoughtful criticism of what I wrote and would be interested in learning more about the projects I couldn't speak of or about the tech itself. Here we go! 

When the market is uncertain, we seem to forget that the cryptocurrency hype is not just about financial gains but that it is also fueling exciting innovations. I felt like writing an overview of what is in my opinion one of the most sensible and promising application of distributed ledger technology: the advent of a ""decentralized"" internet infrastructure. In this post I will mainly focus on decentralized cloud storage.  

**What is decentralized cloud storage, why is it relevant and how does it relate to cryptocurrencies?**

Decentralized cloud storage seems redundant but the idea is that instead of being stored on one server or a group of servers maintained by a company like Amazon, the files would be stored across an entire permission-less network of computer. With high redundancy, it would be much more reliable: if Amazon decides to, they could shut down their Amazon S3 server tomorrow or deny you access to your data for some reason, this is not the case for distributed files the ideal distributed files storage solution. Beyond that there is also the fact that it cuts the cost of the process. The first decentralized storage protocol was IPFS and it is already quite a breakthrough. The idea to use cryptocurrencies or distributed ledgers in general is that you can incentivize nodes in the network to maintain uptime and set up smart contracts that will make redundancy and security cryptographically provable by every party.  It is one of the applications that makes the most sense in the space right now. In every instance, files are broken into multiple pieces, encrypted, and distributed across the network of computers in a highly redundant manner but the specifics of the protocol can change from project to project.

In the following, I will present some of the projects developing such a solution, giving a brief overview of what they do along with some points I find relevant. Everything is open for discussion in the comments below, do point out to mistakes I could have made!

**Filecoin:**

[Website](https://protocol.ai/)

[Whitepaper](https://filecoin.io/filecoin.pdf)

[Blog](https://filecoin.io/blog/)

The token is not tradable yet but it would be a disgrace to not mention Filecoin as the company behind it, Protocols Lab, is also where the IPFS protocol came from. With Filecoin, they want to add smart contracts into the mix  with an underlying architecture inspired by IPFS. The Protocol Labs research center came up with novel protocols such as Proof-of-Replication or Proof-of-Spacetime. Their system will run on a blockchain where ""miners earn [tokens] by providing storage to clients"" which means in broad term that miners' reward is proportional to the storage they give to the network. To be clear, it's not only a cloud storage solution akin to Dropbox or Amazon S3, they want to build an entirely new Content Delivery Network (CDN) protocol that would power everything on the internet. The only issue I found with it is the apparent greed that surrounded their ICO and it's really a shame for such a serious looking project.

Pros: 

* Research oriented project
* Not one whitepaper but a corpus of academic-like papers describing different parts of the protocol
* From the creators of the IPFS protocol, a reference in distributed storage protocols and already used 

Cons:

* Virtually uncapped ICO
* Preferential rate for insiders
* Very research focused, it's unclear what they are aiming for (B2B, P2P?)

**SIA**

[CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/siacoin/)

[Website](https://sia.tech/)

[Whitepaper](https://sia.tech/sia.pdf)

[Blog](https://blog.sia.tech/)

SIA launched their project late 2014 / early 2015. You will notice from the get go that compared to FileCoin they are more consumer oriented in their approach, clearly aiming to be a replacement of Amazon S3 and the likes. Their argument is economical: using distributed storage, they can bring down the cost to $2/TB/month. That's 10 times less than Amazon S3 on paper, a disruptive figure for sure but it remains to be seen if they can scale to that and offer the same extended capabilities. They are using a custom blockchain that ""largely resembles"" Bitcoin with an improved scripting language that suits the need of their project. The mining is unrelated to the files distribution and only serves to secure the contracts between renters and users. The files are broken down in pieces that are encrypted locally using the private key of the user and sent on the network. You have to deposit coins as collateral both for uploading or renting space.

Pros:

* Established since 2015
* Working version with 885 hosts
* Sustained development from a small but dedicated team
* VC backing
* Good and realistic development roadmap
* Truly decentralized


Cons:

* Blockchain inspired by BTC and all the issues that come with it: slow, inefficient power usage (mining) and scripting language, albeit modified. Hard to scale.
* No clear marketing plan
* No built-in file sharing feature: to share a file, the user has to share its private key or the relevant .sia file. It is made outside the blockchain and thus relies on trust.
* Coin deposits pior to usage 
* Not very user friendly 

**Storj**

[CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/storj/)

[Website](https://storj.io)

[Whitepaper](https://storj.io/storj.pdf)

[Blog](https://medium.com/@storjproject)

Storj also launched in 2014. This system is not truly decentralized, 'Bridge' servers ran by Storj store the relevant metadata and contracts that will enable the different parties to meet. To be clear, it does not store any of the files nor the encryption keys but without it, the system doesn't work. This centralization is not necessarily a problem in my opinion, this is a case of what I would call BaaS or 'Blockchain as a Service': Storj is selling a service that uses distributed ledgers and smart contracts to bring down the cost of said service compared to competitors. Storing 1 TB of data currently costs $15 a month or 35% less than Amazon S3. Due to the partially centralized nature, the network is faster and more scalable. 

Pros: 

* Large team
* More user friendly
* Fast and easily scalable 
* No coin deposit needed, payment can be made in any currency
* Established network

Cons:

* Partially centralized: Bridges instances are singular points of failure
* Expensive compared to SIA

**Internxt**

[CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/internxt/)

[Website](https://internxt.io/)

[Whitepaper](https://internxt.io/whitepaper.pdf)

[Blog](https://medium.com/internxt)

INXT debuted in September with an ICO that wasn't an overwhelming success only raising around $500K. They are using the open source code of Storj and building upon it to try to create a product that would be more appealing to the mass market. On the technical side it comes with all the pros and cons of Storj and they are trying to stand out by creating beautiful, user friendly UI/UX. They want to integrate features such as files sharing or live editing like Google Docs. Things came along quite nicely recently when they announced a new CTO with extensive computer science experience and releases their alpha code. They are preparing to release prototypes executables for their cloud alpha. It is a much earlier project than the competitors and it remains to be seen if they will fulfill their vision and come out on top.

Pros: 

* Clear focus on marketing and design
* Use of an established codebase 
* Communicative CEO that is always available to answer questions on Telegram or leaves voice messages
* Experienced CTO and technical advisor

Cons:

* Very early project 
* Will beautiful interfaces be enough to come out on top in this competitive market?
* Will they deliver their innovative features separating them from Storj completely?

There are a lot of other projects in this space that try to take on this challenge, the ones I provided an overview of above are only the ones I can speak of. **Competitors in the field of ""distributed web services"" that I know of but can't speak of in details are:**

- MaidSafe 
- Oyster Pearl 
- SONM (distributed computing)
- Dfinity (distributed computing)
- DADI (complete suite of web services)
- Substratum (decentralized internet protocols, DVPN)
- Force Network (decentralized internet protocols, DVPN)

And there may be a lot of others that I don't know of.

I hope this post was useful, be sure to leave a comment so that we can have a thoughtful discussion on this fascinating application of distributed ledgers and cryptocurrencies! 

Do point out to mistakes I could have made.

I'm trying to delve deeper in blockchain technology. If I understand it correctly (wich is doubtful, I'm not very knowledgeable about computers or programming) a Merkle tree is used to structure data in a tree-like structure with all the hashes pointing other hashes.  
My understanding of blockchain is that all blocks are ordered in chronological order without any branches (excluding forks to other coins) to verify the order of transaction. If this is correct, why is a Merkle tree used to store the data in a different structure?

Do we really need a trustless system ?

What do you think ? Can somehere here dispute his argument ? I'm not experienced enough to have knowlede to dispute him.


His argument :
&gt;
Yeah. There are a ton of Blockchain fanatics that ""preach"" block chain. But whenever someone preaches something ask yourself what they have to gain from it. Developer advocate is very much a sales role. 
&gt;
You have probably been using a block-chain for a while yourself. Git for example is a block-chain. Again; its' nothing new. Is git awesome for source control in a distributed fashion? Definitely. Would use abuse it as a database? Probably not. 
&gt;
Can you use block-chain for contracts? Sure. But you can also just store them in a 'normal' database. **Most enterprise systems have audit trails and these mechanisms often are a lot more in-depth than just recording the changes in data; they also record who changed them. **
&gt;
Again; block-chain is nothing special. It's all technology that has existed for a LONG time and solves problems that have also been solved for a LONG time. The current hype around Blockchain is because people really don't understand it, don't understand how simple it is, and think it's something special because of the volatility surrounding Bitcoin.

However, there are TONS of uses for blockchain outside of cryptocurrencies. But, because the easiest / most common way to get investors for a blockchain project is to use cryptocurrency, there are plenty of coins for projects out there that really just do not need coins. 

So, my question is, what do you think is the best way to find and invest in these blockchain projects that (correctly so) are not using coins? It seems to me like it will likely be finding companies that seem more willing to adopt blockchain into their day to day operations than their competitors. It seems like this means you'd have to invest in larger companies as well, as small blockchain startups will probably be VC funded, not have stock, or try to introduce an unnecessary coin.

We work on Bloom Protocol. Ask us anything about tech!","Hello, we are Derek Silva and Augusto Guevara, from the team behind Bloom Protocol (https://bloom.co). Ask us anything about Bloom’s technology! We’ll be taking your questions for 1 hour, starting at 19:15/7:15pm GMT (now)! I'll also be responding to  your questions throughout the evening. 

Here’s our proof: https://twitter.com/DerekSilva/status/973638342159069193 and https://twitter.com/HODLitALL/status/973639867694551040!

Bloom is an end-to-end protocol for identity attestation, risk assessment and credit scoring, entirely on the blockchain. Bloom allows both traditional and digital currency lenders to serve billions of people who currently cannot obtain a bank account or credit score.

Jesse Leimgruber, one of the cofounders, encountered an inability to procure the credit he needed to buy a home despite building a very successful business and having the assets needed all because he didn't have 7 years of credit history built up. This is an issue more and more people running into as they make smarter financial decisions to not take unnecessary credit/debt, and they're being penalized for it instead of rewarded for being fiscally responsible.

Bloom is using the Bloom Token, Ethereum Whisper, and IPFS to solve several problems:

- High Risk of Identity Theft
- Cross-Border Credit Scoring
- Creditworthiness Assessment
- Limited Ability to Expand
- Uncompetitive Credit Scoring

So far Bloom has secured partnerships with several traditional lending institutions and other blockchain-based companies (https://blog.hellobloom.io/tagged/partnership), and we have begun to fill out our ranks with developers and operational staff as well.

Obstacles include general awareness of blockchain, understanding of why the Bloom Token is necessary, moving people away from traditional credit scoring mechanisms (where available), and global coverage.

However, less than 10% of these sellers are currently accepting digital payments.

The goal of BELUGA is to use blockchain technologies and crypto currency to develop an open source resource migration platform. This will allow to digitize tools for small enterprises and their clients in developing countries, and the mission of BELUGA is to help non-banking billions to become part of a new, better and fair global financial system.

BelugaPay also has partnerships with reputable institutions. One of them is Banorte Bank with an income of more than 4.5 million dollars. Cooperation with this bank allows users to apply for loans using their sales system. Partnership with Pemex, one of the largest oil companies in Mexico, also increases the credibility of this company. With revenues of $ 120 billion, Pemex also integrated the BelugaPay application so that users can pay for gas at their stations using a crypto or credit card through the BelugaPay application.

The Beluga team believes that the alliance between traditional payment systems and the crypto-currency market gives an excellent opportunity to influence the lives of millions of people. The current payment processing ecosystem includes various intermediaries, such as buyers, issuers, gateways, network cards and ISO.

For the last 3 years Beluga has developed a number of payment instruments:

1) application for mobile sales outlets for iOS and Android;

2) restaurant software for customer management, menus and staff;

3) One-level payment technology Peer 2 peer.

The POS BELUGA application is currently in a private alpha version for iOS.

In order to understand some of the concepts in Bitcoin010 , I created a separate Blockchain fundamentals book, which teaches you the basics of cryptography and hashing.

You can limit the amount of data per record and change the access key to each record, but once any record was allowed, that individual record could be copied off-chain.  

Is something like this possible, and if so how would you go about it?

I was really excited about enigma and bought some as privacy of smart contract data is a no brainer for good dApps. Think a global know your customer dApp or one that can share biometric data but still keep data private, only revealing parts to parties who require it. I think dApps like this will be huge in the future. Maybe not even requiring a passport to enter a country (long stretch i know).

I ended up selling Enigma after i realised ethereum is implementing zero proofs, they appear to solve the same problem, but now they now enigma is going up in value and i sold at the worst time, so a bit of FOMO is in my mind. Anyways, Enigma have no working product yet and since ethereum is implementing zero proofs. which appear to provide the same service, i.e. they both appear to solve Yaos millionares problem (link below); but im guessing there is more to this i.e. zero proofs vs Homomorphic Encryption. 

So im not convinced buying ENG again is a good idea yet, they have some solutions for scaling but i didnt did deep into that area. Besides NEO has dBFT and Eth is moving to PoS. So if anything that ENG comes up with thats better, what would it be? outside of consensus, perhaps better dApp cost reduction / efficiency within the protocol, we remember cryptokitties. Not sure what else is on their road map. Some people mentioned ENG is an agnostic dApp and can interact with other dApps on NEO, ETH etc, but that doesnt really make any sense to me as a statement.

Enigma has solved the millioares problem explained here:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao%27s_Millionaires%27_Problem

Here is an explanation of Zero proofs

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof

A non heavy read on what zero proofs are if you dont want to go through the wikipedia

https://hackernoon.com/eli5-zero-knowledge-proof-78a276db9eff

What do you guys think? Does Enigma bring something to the table with private data in a dApp that Zero proofs do not? What do you think about the Enigma roadmap and what they plan to do in the dApp space vs NEO and Ethereum?

As the requirements state, you may use https://remix.ethereum.org/

There are no Gas Requirements for this challenge.

The description states that you need to:

          - Create a smart contract that stores the name and age of a given person. 

          - Accounts are not allowed to change the name of other accounts name and age.
          
          - Name and Age must be declared as public / private.
          
          - The contract must have an account owner.

Currently with your standard crypto, the flow is:

Alice gives Bob her address and requests an amount. 
Bob sends to Alice’s address the amount she requested. 

The places where this can go wrong is Alice gives Bob the wrong address, the wrong amount, or Bob mistypes or otherwise messes up the address or amount. In an irreversible system this is a seriously problem. Stuff like the bitpay payment protocol solves the amount problem:

Alice gives Bob a QR code containing the address and amount. 
Bob can send only that amount to that address. 

But this still doesn’t counter the address problem. I find that this is the #1 scariest thing about crypto, particularly for new users - the potential that you send to the wrong address or that for some reason the payment doesn’t get to the other side. And you have no recourse. Test transactions to the address in small amounts are a total kludge. 

So what I’m imagining is a system that sort of opens a connection before sending payment - not a full blown payment channel, just merely establishing the the address and amount are correct. For example:

Alice gives Bob a QR code containing the address and amount. 
Bob initiates a transaction to the address and amount. 
Alice receives notice that Bob has initiated the transaction, and sends a confirmation to Bob that the amount is correct. 
Bob acknowledges the confirmation, and the transaction goes through. 

This seems like something that should be solvable at the network/wallet level and doesn’t need to involve the chain. But I’ve personally never seen a crypto work this way, even though it’s an obviously solution to a major problem. So what gives? Can’t be that no one has thought of this, so is there a technological issue here?

after having followed the space for a while I want to get deeper into actually developing on and with blockchain technology.
My background is in machine learning and data engineering in general. I have already programmed a few contracts in solidity and built a small frontend in web3.js. My goal is to understand where I could potentially go from there in terms of more in depth knowledge about ethereum but also building custom blockchains (which will probably immensely valuable in terms of freelance work soon) From what I can tell the bigger projects right now are:

* Ethereum for public smart contracts. Involves Solidity and web3.js for the frontend. Truffle would be the preferred choice as a framework, together with zeppelin for reference implementations
* Cosmos and Tendermint for developing your own blockchain in a more or less pre-configured, interoperable system 
* The Apache Hyperledger projects, solving a similar problem but seems to be more for enterprise/private chains

Anything else I should be looking at? Any good courses or blog series you can recommend the brush up on the cryptography and network architecture of blockchains? The Ethereum wiki seems great, just wondering if there are other things.

Nevertheless, several states in the US are moving quickly to codify it into their laws—which, given where things stand, might not be so smart.


The trend: Earlier this month, Tennessee became the second state to go out of its way to legally recognize smart contracts (PDF); Arizona passed similar legislation last year. In both cases, lawmakers amended existing statutes governing the use of electronic forms and signatures to explicitly include the terms “blockchain” (in Arizona’s case), “distributed ledger” (Tennessee’s choice) and “smart contract.” Several other states have considered similar changes.


Why states suddenly &lt;3 crypto: The bills seem to be little more than pro-crypto posturing meant to attract investment and entrepreneurs. Tennessee’s new law, for example, states that a legal contract can’t be invalidated just because it is “executed through a smart contract.” But such clarification is not needed, according to Perianne Boring and Amy Kim at the Chamber of Digital Commerce, a blockchain trade association in Washington, DC. Existing federal and state laws already provide an “unquestionable legal basis” for this, they argue.


The dreaded “patchwork”: But those laws also provide uniformity, whereas Tennessee’s smart contract law is not even identical to Arizona’s. If enough states create differing versions, “it’s just going to be chaos,” says Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at Coin Center, a policy think tank that advocates for blockchain companies.


False certainty: New laws will likely add confusion and unnecessary complexity and cost, says Andrew Hinkes, a lawyer and adjunct professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. That could hamper technological development. “Laws should not attempt to define technologies that do not have a widely held definition in their relevant technical communities,” says Hinkes.


Dumb computer code: “Smart contract” is also a misnomer from a legal perspective: it doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with a legal contract. A smart contract is simply an “if-then” statement that runs on a blockchain. While it’s possible to automate some actions that parties must take under an actual legal contract, like payment obligations that kick in on a certain date, a real contract is “a much more multi-faceted instrument,” says Angela Walch, an associate professor at St. Mary’s School of Law in Texas. For instance, it may include a standard of behavior, like “reasonable” or “in good faith” that can’t be encoded in software.


Tennessee’s new law isn’t even clear on what it means by words like “contract” and “executed.” As Walch notes, they mean different things depending on how they are used, sometimes referring to computer programs and other times referring to legal contracts. The bill also relies on other, still-poorly-defined terms to describe blockchain technology and smart contracts, including “event-driven,” “permissionless,” and “decentralized.” It’s “a recipe for confusion down the road,” she says.

So if any of you guys have seen Black Mirror, we see some of the risks associated with widespread implementation of technology like this. Millions of tiny robotic drones controlled by software vulnerable to anyone smart enough to seize control. 


What if we had a blockchain based solution?

Run these bees on a decentralized, internationally backed up network (via nodes on participants computers/servers) that can’t be tampered with or hijacked. 

Staking or use/burning of coins could be used to attract bees to an area to pollinate. 



Just had an idea. Thoughts on whether this could work or not? Or if blockchain would not be suitable for this kind of task?

Ruby was the last language I used professionally, it's my favorite language and the only thing I use if I have to code for my hobbies.

I became interested in crypto market behavior,  and found the CryptoCompare site.  Turns out there are Ruby bindings for their API.   So I started looking at data trying to prove a theory I've long held about crypto currencies.

Ruby can pack a lot of computational request into a single line of code.  Ruby plus CryptoCompare allows me to quickly issue single commands and get back lists and arrays that show me things,  it's pretty freakin cool actually.

So I actually did started seeing some results,  but I got stuck.

I look at Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether and (X),  X being an attempt at 'every other alt coin'

If I let X be every other coin CryptoCompare tracks (besides the three I mentioned)  I get pretty much nonsense.

If I let X be 10 coins I choose (I just randomly grab 10 from my memory)  results make some sense.

If I let X be a list of Top Y coins, 'top' defined by market cap or volume,   results make better sense but become inconsistent across multiple days.

Is there any consensus around coin classifications NOT based on price or volume or any trading data of any kind?

CryptoCompare assigns two values to each coin they track , Algorithm and ProofType,  are those definitions standardized?  A lot of the algorithm fields are 'N/A',  one was 'X11' ???.

We are proud to announce the upcoming AMA coming to our sub. The AMA is scheduled to be on Tuesday, March 27th, at 5 PM Eastern Time.    

The creators of [Holochain](https://holochain.org/) and co-founders of [Holo](https://holo.host/), Arthur Brock (u/ArtBrock) and Eric Harris-Braun (u/zippy314), will be available to answer questions and discuss the technology behind Holochain, an agent-centric, consensus-less approach to distributed computing.  
Information provided by Holo:  
&gt; Holochain is a truly peer-to-peer protocol for distributed computing that enables a distributed web with user autonomy built directly into its architecture and
protocols. Distributing the storage and processing of our data can change
how we coordinate and interact. With digital integration under user control,
Holochain liberates our online lives from corporate control over our choices
and information.

&gt; Holo is how we'll bridge the adoption gap from the new, distributed Internet back
to the centralized Internet of today. Using a global network of distributed hosts
who earn Holo fuel (a revolutionary asset-backed, mutual credit crypto-accounting
system) for their services, Holochain apps can be accessed by anyone from the
centralized web.

The pattern was the encoding of the private key, the number of colours was the base that it was encoded in.

In order to solve this puzzle, you needed to map each colour to all possible baseN numbers. Then convert them to ascii. 

The set that remains and does not have any funny symbols, is the winner. 

Also note, that after doing this twice, you notice that the scheme used was a mini private key and so the solution should always start with an S.

Here is the python implementation of the solution:

Confined to the ERC20 world, traders must transition to a centralized service if they would like to gain access to cross chain assets (ETH/BTC for example). Additionally, there is no path for anyone to gain exposure from crypto to real world assets, like AAPL/USDT, even from a centralized service. Usually, traders are looking to gain price exposure to an asset and do not care about actually taking custody of that asset. For instance, if a trader thinks bitcoin will rise in value and wants to make a profit, they don’t actually need or perhaps even want to hold bitcoin, rather just earn profit from its price appreciation.

Blockchain 1.0 - BTC LTC VTC - basic blockchain, blocks contain data like a hash pointer, transaction data, and time stamp. Proof of work 

Blockchain 2.0 - ETH NEO QTUM - 1.0 + smart contracts. Proof of work, Proof of stake, DBFT

Blockchain 3.0 - ARK, ADA, ICX, WAN, AION - These implement a new feature like cross chain functionality and/or have new incentive mechanisms like master nodes. Proof of stake, DPOS 

Blockchain 4.0 - NANO IOTA HPB VEN IOT INT EOS CPC CS - These are either IoT related, DAG/Tangle, or changing the game in terms of scalability. The IoT projects are looking to integrate blockchain with IoT, some even adding distributed storage to the mix. Tangle/DAGs are reducing/eliminating fees and reducing transaction process time. Scalability improving projects are shooting for over 100k tx/s some even saying 1 million. 

Blockchain 5.0 - ???

Machine learning, game breaking scalability, new incentive mechanism? 

Technology evolves, what do you believe could realistically be next ?

All DPoS-like coins supports more than 1k TPS, and PayPal processes on average 100 TPS and 500 TPS at peak. I believe DLT is ok for scaling and great for the low fees. However, merchants typically drop crypto because of volatility. How is this being fixed? I feel like much of the resources and attention go into improving scalability, and volatility gets very little attention.

Up until now, I see two solutions being worked on:

- **Stablecoins**: Needs a trustless approach to collateral or some other non-collaterized way to work (e.g. control monetary supply to manipulate the price--typically results in a pyramid scheme.) No reliable solution yet as far as I know.
- **Fiat exchange**: As soon as you get paid in crypto, you exchange for actual fiat. However, this completely eliminates the benefits of using crypto: fees will be very high, and you will still depend on a centralized solution. Only advantage is that users can pay anonymously via untraceable coins, and this is already leveraged by darknet markets.

What other ways are there to solve this? Anyone more informed about the SOTA on this? Am I alone in believing solving this is more crucial for adoption than improving scalability is? All research in Ethereum and Bitcoin addresses scalability, programmability, and privacy, but I just don't see much concern about volatility despite vendors explicitly saying they drop Bitcoin [because of volatility](https://www.coindesk.com/steam-drops-bitcoin-payments-citing-high-fees-price-volatility/).","","85s0qx",NA,0,NA,"false",1522329149,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","TRADING","Training","false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/85s0qx/how_is_volatility_being_fixed/","","Redditor for 8 months.",NA,"TRADING","",0,0

I'm trying to figure out which altcoin might replace Bitcoin in the future due to superior technology.

As far as I can see, the 3 most important attributes of a cryptocurrency are VISA-like scalability, resilience to tampering and energy usage.

Is it Nano due to zero transaction fees and almost instant transaction times or IOTA, because of its tangle that provided quantum-resistant cryptography and also non existing transaction fees. Nano also has 1 millionth energy usage of Bitcoin, right?

Looking at the most popular cryptos right now, none of them have technology that can scale, is that true? Correct me if I'm wrong. I don't know all cryptocurrencies in all of their detail.

1. BCH, has double the blocksize, which has no O-notation impact on scalability. Otherwise, just as ""bad"" as Bitcoin.
2. Ethereum isn't much more scalable than Bitcoin, and doesn't use much less energy, does it?
3. Ripple isn't a cryptocurrency as we know it
4. Litecoin just has a different algorithm than Bitcoin, with everything else being the same
5. What about the remaining top20 coins Cardano, EOS, Stellar, NEO, DASH, NEM, TRON, QTUM, DigixDAO, are they scalable and economical?
6. What about VeChain? Can it compete with NANO and IOTA in a sense?
7. Of the remaining top50 coins, I have heard OMG, PPT, WAVES, SIACOIN, WTC, Veritaseum, Ziliqa being shilled a lot. Is their reputation as good as their technology, can they compete with NANO?
8. What about the other top 50 coins ETH classic, LISK, Bitcoin Gold, ZCASH, Steem, Stratis, Bytecoin, Bitshares, RHOC, Dogecoin, Aeternety, Augur, Bytom, Status, Decred, Ontology, Komodo, Hshare. I have never heard of most of them, are they just good marketing (Dogecoin, Bitcoin Gold, Eth classic) without unique technology behind them or are there some that I should keep an eye on.

From my understanding, only NANO and IOTA have the technology that would allow them to replace Bitcoin and scale to VISA-like transaction volume if ever. Is there any currency that I should also know about that can compete with them?

Please provide information why a technology of a specific coin is good, not just saying that ICX is great. Thanks.

**EDIT: Since PRL is a fork of IOTA and soon SHL, those 2 can also be considered as part of this top group, can they?**

I believe pow-algorithms that are easily manufactured are good for decentralization. Easy to manufacture leads to small upfront costs and cheap chips. Imagine a cheap radiator that heats your apartment and makes money for you. With ASIC-resistant algorithm the radiator would be as expensive as the most expensive graphics cards and the ASIC manufacturer would probably make a lot of money (less competition due to high upfront costs).

&amp;nbsp;

The founder, Borzalom, has had two previous coins that were never went anywhere. Around last February, he started to try and resurrect a known scam project called BitMox, because he was invested in it.

The source code has been private the whole time (minus the initial fork). The final testnet was supposed to happened end of 2017. On 12-28, after having radio silence for the last week, they stated that they have found some patentable part of the code, and need to delay the testnet while the company is registered and the patent applications take place. They instead ran testnet 2 again (which is on the old bitmox/btc chain with supposedly PoS implemented). It achieved 568 TPS (IIRC as part of PoS they disable some of the security limitations that constraints BTC to 7 tps. But not sure what else it all involved).

They obtained the company registration in the Seychelles in mid-February. They said in February, they are applying for 4 patents and it should go patent pending in early April at which point they'll get additional developers to sign an NDA and review Borzaloms code, then the real final testnet will happen. A bunch of the investors form a strong community team of 90 people (and are paid in a new XFuel currency thats not traded on any exchanges and was introduced last fall to provide revenue for developers, etc). However, a lot of the community is far too often detached from Borz/CCRev who are actually involved in the project.

The founder Borzolom, is ""anonymous""  (we know his name - based out of Hungary) and the only developer of the core mainnet code. He hasn't shared the mainnet code with anyone to this point (rumors of one person helping debug pieces of it, but don't think they've seen it all - if they've indeed seen any of it). The community will often point to the openness/activity of the Github, but the only things there are the community-driven code (xcite wallet) and not any of the actual mainnet code that is the key to Xtrabytes goals.

&amp;nbsp; 

 There are more concerns/red flags that I haven't shared, but my main question is regarding how possible/achievable are their stated Blockchain goals:

* 10,000 TPS
* Dapps are code-agnostic
* And more goals listed in whitepaper here: https://xtrabytes.global/whitepaper.pdf","","86o5un",NA,0,NA,"false",1522347272,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","WARNING","Warning-level1","false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/86o5un/how_realistic_and_obtainable_are_the_goalsclaims/","","2 - 3 years account age. 150 - 300 comment karma.",NA,"WARNING","",0,0

Skycoin has a completely novel consensus protocol called Obelisk. It completely removes mining, 51% attack resistant, no PoW type centralisation and removes a massive vulnerability that't not often talked about on Bitcoin which is using the normal insecure internet protocol. 

&gt; Unsecured internet protocol — attacks on Bitcoin involving the creation of a shadow network could result in users connecting to fake nodes and being fed fake blocks, all the while unaware of the fact they’re not connected to the real Bitcoin network. This places Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies at the mercy of the internet protocol they run on.


This article provides quite a good technical summary of the differences as a result of this novel approach. 

For those who don't know, Skycoin is a project that started 6-7 years ago and they are probably one of the most advance blockchain project out there. I know everyone says this but really, just look at their github, it's very active and very open-source/grass-roots.

One of their main application called Skywire is their own version of incentivised meshnet based on the very famous [cjdns](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns)  and open flow. Not only they essentially are trying to decentralise ISP and provide decentralised bandwidth with Skywire, they will also provide computational power and storage (this is being developed by their partner SPACO network). 

Anyway, they are able to fix this insecurity because of Skywire. 

Thoughts? How come it seems we rarely see new consensus protocols?

Eric Harris-Braun (/u/zippy314) and Arthur Brock (/u/artbrock) of Holo and Holochain are here to answer your questions about Distributed software, cryptocurrency design, and anything else in the Holoverse!

(Will (/u/qubist1) is also here here facilitating.)

Art and Eric have been designing alternative currencies and creating peer-to-peer software since the '80s. Now, they and an amazing [team](https://holochain.org/team.html), riding the wave of the crypto-explosion, are working to create software for truly distributed apps with no consensus or mining by shifting the very mindset the technology is built on.

Holochain is a truly peer-to-peer protocol for distributed computing that enables a distributed web with user autonomy built directly into its architecture and protocols. Distributing the storage and processing of our data can change how we coordinate and interact. With digital integration under user control, Holochain liberates our online lives from corporate control over our choices and information.

Holo is how we'll bridge the adoption gap from the new distributed Internet back to the centralized Internet of today. Using a global network of distributed hosts who earn Holo fuel (a revolutionary asset-backed, mutual credit crypto-accounting system) for their services, Holochain apps can be accessed by anyone from the centralized web.

I have seen many discussion about how marketcap is an inaccurate statistic about a coins value, because you can manipulate it if you have low liquidity and one of your coins gets bought for $1000 (marketcap = price * circulating supply). 

Another point to look at is volume. In this case EOS has more volume than ETH, which is strange to me as ETH volume should be big because of it's usage right now, definitely bigger than EOS. Is there some conclusion that can be made out of this? I am very curious.

Note that EOS marketcap is ~4x times less than ETH.","false","8filot",NA,0,NA,"false",1529651855,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","TRADING",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/8filot/eth_has_more_marketcap_than_eos_but_eos_has_more/","t3_8filot",NA,NA,"TRADING","",0,0

I'm trying to get my head around this and hope you can help.

With respect to the recent discussion on a hard cap for ETH coin supply and the upcoming switch to PoS, I'm not sure how this is not contributing to extreme inequality as compared to either PoW systems or PoS without hard cap. But I'm not sure, whether my thinking is wrong...

So, with PoS + fixed amount of coins: assume, I have 10% of the coins and I'm getting rewarded by putting my coins at stake for PoS based consensus. Wouldn't my % of coins owned grow without anything stopping this? With PoW, my % growing could at least be slowed by other people buying hardware to do PoW (thus increasing mining difficulty and thus my reward as a miner). With an uncapped coin supply, my % would be slowed down as new coins are created.

I would thus assume, that in PoS your incentive to hold your coins instead of spending them is inherently high (which would also increase the price tremendously). Again, compared to PoW, you don't need to hold your coins as they are not part of the mining process.

So how would this work in the long run? Have I overlooked some aspect or is there a flaw in my thinking?

I have an idea for a dApp, and i want to build it on ethereum, its nothing thats going to make money, i just want to do it for fun. and the best way to understand ""smart contract"" coins is to get your hands dirty. I would prefer solidity. i code mostly c#, javascript, typescript, angular (which is just js/ts anyways). i like Solidity because its based on the ECMA standard and is statically typed. javascript is also based on the ECMA standard, so the code is readable for me. 

I could dev c# on another dApp platform like NEO but id like to learn solidity.

that brings up the question, should i learn dApp development in a language im more comfortable in c# on NEO or should i just not worry too much about the solidity learning curve?

Which brings up another point, both these projects have playgrounds so i dont have to pay GAS? or at least not an excessive amount.

If there is a better dApp platform with what ive just said, please let me know. also id prefer not to write the dApp is JS. i would use typescript if i had to (superset of javascript which transpiles to native js, makes writing js much easier)

but yes, if any of you know a really good ethereum / solidity dApp tutorial, that would be great, i need to start small as my idea is a bit complicated. its not useful to be sold, but i want to build a dApp that provides end to end encryption when sending messages to people in your contact list, it would be a windows / mac wateva app. think ICQ back in the 90s if your'e that old haha.

A key aspect of the Bitcoin protocol is that the total number of bitcoins is capped at 21 million, after which no more will ever be issued. This makes Bitcoin appealing to many people because something that will never increase in supply is more likely to hold its value. The problem is that in the event of a crisis, there would also be no way to add liquidity to the system, since you can’t “print” more bitcoins. The central bank could build up a stash of bitcoins that it could then funnel into the system, but that would do little good because people would know the stash was limited. And in any case, the central bank’s demand for Bitcoin would drive up its price, which would make people more likely to hold onto it and less willing to spend it—the opposite of what you want in a financial crisis.

I think it won't happen for reasons in this post. What do you think?","What do you all think of payment coins in general? I've got a list of points why this wont happen, i mentioned them in the thread on this sub, asking if btc deserves its market cap. Figured it might deserve its own post.

I think a payment coin (btc, nano, btccash, etc) being widely adopted as an alternative to fiat payment wont happen for the following reasons:

- cryptos are volatile in value relative to your fiat. if you intended to use it as general payment e.g. buying coffee or a laptop online. the fluctuations in value especially crashes really suck, especially if you have large sums of money there. oh i cant buy that laptop now because my crypto has fallen by 30%. Satoshi said that volatitily would stabalise over time with btc, but i disagree with this, just my opinion, its been 9 years of btc with high volatility, with very few using for adoption in gen payment, btc does 200k transactions a day, its mainly investors and people using it as a trading pair for alts on exchanges.

- you have no charge backs like with a credit card or pay pal if the merchant does something wrong. so why would i use a payment coin that has no chargebacks if there is no cost advantage? the visa fee is something like 2-3% more if its forex. however the merchant eats the fee. even if the merchant offered a discount for using crypto to buy something, point 1 is still a huge issue, and the savings the merchant would offer probably would not be enough incentive e.g. 2-3% in most cases.

- with cryptos, you need to be your own bank, securing cryptos isn't hard, but not user friendly to people who are not tech literate, however big strides have been made there with easy to use wallets. However there is still the potential for phishing, losing keys etc. VISA card, no problem, call up the bank, cancel the card get a new one. The bank will refund any money spent by someone who stole you card, at least here in Australia.

- most payment coins are not not fungible e.g. btc except monero, this means that the btc you used can be traced back to some nefarious activity, a drug deal etc. this could land you in hot water, but not likely. however it would give pause for adoption by merchants. e.g. people could be laundering btc through them to say buy macbook pros and sell them on ebay.

- in the case of btc and public block chains as soon you spend BTC, people know your wallet address, they now know your balance. even if you try to hide your balance with multiple wallets and transfers, block chain analysis will find where the jackpot is. if they are motivated to do so, perhaps they know you might have a lot of btc for example. coin mixers no longer work. this is a huge problem. monero does not have this problem however as do some of the other private payment coins.

- in the case of btc, it has slow confirmation times and expensive transaction fees, though this could be fixed with LN. other payment coins like nano do not have this problem, thought i would still add this as a point. i guess this is not really a point to stop adoption. but i added it here as people generally only know about btc.

- we can see in the case of BTC, it was never really adopted for general payment. most use it as an investment, to buy alts, or people who choose to use it as payment over fiat if its available, id classify these people as being enthusiastic about using crypto, but you can see in the case of BTC, over the years, most people didnt use it for this purpose. btc was used in darknets however. this is why i invested in monero as i saw the flaws in btc (lack of annonymity, and fungibility) and figured darknets would eventually adopt monero in the long term.

- didnt add this in my first post, but a problem i have with payment coins is that they are also deflationary as they have a fixed supply. libetarians love the idea of hard money that can not be printed, but i think most have not studied up on modern economics and different schools of thought; Keynesian principles are the dominant thinking, the money supply should expand with the increased goods and services produced in the economy i.e. increases in gdp should ideally expand the money supply. You also have the austrian school that stipulates that gold or a fixed supply asset tied to money is better, i dont really agree but they do bring up some good points in some respects with smoothing the economic boom / busts, but i wasnt sold. deflation in a payment crypto is bad, it encourages hording as the value will go up as more people are chasing less btc as an example. you want moderate inflation as it would actually encourage people to spend or invest as holding onto the crypto would see a steady loss of 2-3% a year, omitting price volatility i mentioned in point 1. perhaps the volatility however would be less with inflationary coins. this was a problem with the gold standard and why they abandoned it. this is a controversial topic. as many people believe that governments are stealing money via inflation through seigniorage i..e they print it first so they get the most value before it gets further inflated. this is really more applicable to countries who print money to fund their government, which isnt applicable to modern economies. it is an issue in some countries with very high inflation that do just this.

ive mentioned monero. (not trying to shill here, insert other private payment coin here) it has the flaws of point 1 which is huge, so wont be adopted widely for general payment. however its fungible, people cant look up how much you own. transactions are anonymous. so even with the problem with point 1. privacy even at a cost has value and good use cases. hiding money from the govt, transferring it overseas. nefarious activities, e.g. buying drugs online. but those are niche use cases. so i dont ever see monero or another private coin being adopted for general payment either.

if a payment coin can some how exist in the future where it resolves the points i mentioned e.g. holding its value to fiat, then id be interested. however maintaining the value of a crypto relative to fiat would require financial instruments like hedging which would increase the cost of using the crypto for payment thus potentially making it moot for general payment for any cost advantage. the charge back problem could be solved by say a company providing an equivalent type of crypto credit card without credit (or with credit), but this would incur cost of using the crypto, banks make this money back with interest, which is very high, credit cards its 25% or so in Australia. 

So given all these points, and the above paragraph where i see the only feasible way a general payment coin can exist (which would render using crypto in the first place pointless). do you agree? or think that its possible for the wide adoption of a crypto for general payment?

edit, i realise that there is more to crypto then payment which many cite without addressing my points, i find payment coins the least promising out of them. dApps and remittance focused coins for sure. other platform based ones like oyster too, perhaps icon and ark but i need to get a better understanding of them. right now i own xrp, xlm, xmr, ada, eth, prl, iota (possibly payment yes, but has data storage on the tangle thus is useful in other protocols as its ideal for static data storage and retrieval e..g video streaming, oyster pearl is using the tangle for just this reason), neo and ont.

Hopefully someone with better hardware and protocol knowledge can shed some light.  I will first cover some assumptions and then pose my question.

The reason that Ethereum is considered ASIC resistant is that miners in the network need to run Turing complete code which exists in smart contracts.  The fastest chips we have for running this kind of code are GPUs.  Thus up until now, GPUs are the preferred method of mining Ethereum.

My question is what keeps someone from separating the process of running smart contract code and the PoW hashing to create a faster miner.  In my mind, their would be a way to make a much faster mining rig if you have 1 gpu and one traditional ASIC chip for checking hashes for PoW.  The system (or protocol for the rig) would be:

1.  As soon as a new block starts in the blockchain, select several smart contracts from a waiting pool to add to your block
2.  Send this code to the GPU to process the code quickly
3.  Get the outputs needed from running the code
4.  Fire up the ASIC to guess and check its way to a valid nonce

This setup allows the GPU to still process code and integrates an ASIC chip for accelerated PoW mining once the code is run.  This seems way to easy and should have been done a long time ago.  There must be something I'm missing here.  

Just to be clear, I'm not really interested in debating the solutions to Bitmain's new ASIC.  I'm really just curious about Ethereum mining in general.

I have a few bugs I can't get my eyes off of and they are related to Bitcoin.  

I choose to post here because although 2018 might not be a guillotine year for crypto efficiency, if technology advances at a fast pace ...which it does, it should at least start to hint at who will be headless in the future.

So, I think the neatest way to go about this is to get the ""price"" argument out of the way by saying that, since bitcoin has been around for over a decade, it has gained the momentum to act as a popular point of entry to the market; allowing it to achieve the most pairs in every exchange.  Serving purpose as a profit taker and fueling, through it's volume, leverage trading which keeps it going as an engine.  It's sort of like a populist regime...  It's only fueled by (an obscure) money flow. 

So, with that out of the way, I want to be a skeptic and hopefully you guys can convince me otherwise.

**Right now bitcoin is valuable (technologically) because it is the first (successful) cryptographic-proof secure store of value on the internet.**

But Bitcoin is literally the MVP of the crypto technologies.  In fact, nobody really knows what would happen if its code is tampered with, hence all the drama with segwit, bla bla, etc.  

So far, it has found 'patches' to work through *some* of its deficiencies but overall, I can't believe people in IT would say that this is leading tech that has a future.

Change my view, please.

Thank you.

Bitcoin.com does not endorse nor support this product/service. Bitcoin.com is not responsible for or liable for any content, accuracy or quality within the press release.

There are well established markets for trading the vast majority of commodities that are significant to the global economy. This includes everything from oil to gold to even soybeans. But there is one major commodity for which that isn’t true – diamonds.

That’s finally going to change in 2018 with the launch of CEDEX, a decentralized diamond exchange that will transform diamonds into a tradable asset.

Diamonds have been a steady store of value throughout modern history, similarly to gold and other precious metals. The problem is that very few people have access to the diamond market. This is primarily a consequence of three factors specific to the diamond industry: lack of transparency, lack of liquidity, and lack of standardization.

By solving all three of these issues, CEDEX has built a bridge that will connect the diamond industry to innovative financial markets. Before discussing that solution, though, it’s important to understand the problems.

First is the lack of transparency. How can you determine what any given diamond is worth? Unless you’re an expert, the answer is that you have to take it to a professional appraiser. The appraiser will then evaluate the diamond and try to gauge its true worth, a somewhat subjective process that may be inconsistent from one appraiser to the next. As a consequence, there isn’t clear and transparent pricing for diamonds and general investors can’t purchase them with any confidence.

Even if the lack of transparency were solved, investors would face another serious problem – lack of liquidity. While diamonds are a durable good, they are mainly sold to end customers in a one-sided transaction. As a result, diamond owners can’t expect to resell their diamonds for anything close to fair market value. In fact, diamonds are usually resold at a loss of 30% – 50%. This leaves no incentive for general investors to even consider diamonds.

The third problem is a lack of standardization, or fungibility. One gram of gold has the same value as any other gram of gold, but the same can’t be said for diamonds. Each one is unique, and its value must be assessed using multiple metrics. Professional diamond appraisers know these metrics best, but they still can’t achieve anything close to perfect standardization.

Those are the three big obstacles that need to be overcome in order for diamonds to finally join the rest of the major commodities with established markets for trading them. By doing so, a market with incredible potential would be unlocked.

Overcoming those obstacles isn’t going to be easy, but CEDEX has developed the solution to make it happen. The first critical part of that solution is bringing together the two sides of the diamond market. That will happen on CEDEX.com, the decentralized exchange platform that runs on CEDEX coin. CEDEX coin is an ERC-20 compatible token that will be traded on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to easily transfer their capital between diamonds, cryptocurrencies, and fiat currencies.

On the supply side of the market, existing diamond dealers will use CEDEX as a new distribution channel. Private holders, meanwhile, will have their first opportunity to resell their diamonds at fair market prices.

The demand side of the market will be almost entirely new. General investors and cryptocurrency investors alike will have access to diamonds as a means of hedging against inflation, the stock market, and volatility in other crypto coins. For investors who question how digital assets have any value, CEDEX coin can even serve as an entryway into the greater cryptocurrency markets.

What about the lack of standardized and transparent pricing, though? Enter the DEX – CEDEX’s proprietary machine learning algorithm. The DEX was designed to evaluate diamonds transparently and coherently at a pricing accuracy rate of over 99.5%. As it’s available on the CEDEX platform, this provides anybody with a means of accurately appraising a diamond’s value without taking it to a professional appraiser.

Diamonds are appraised by the DEX according to three main criteria. They are assigned a gemological purity “score” based on data collected from the Gemological Institute of America (GIA). Additionally, the DEX analyzes each diamond’s parallel composite and indices composite. The parallel composite indicates how rare the particular diamond type is, while the indices composite gives investors insight on current market sentiment.

With the DEX, the days of human subjectivity being a part of diamond appraisals are soon going to be a thing of the past. If somebody is given the choice to trust a human they’ve never met before or a piece of open-source software that is transparent and trustless, they will choose the later. Trustlessness is a fundamental feature of cryptocurrencies that makes them valuable, and it is equally important to the CEDEX platform.

A beta version of the DEX is already available on the CEDEX platform so that you can try it out for yourself. You can also find more information there about registering for the CEDEX Token pre-sale, which will start on January 12th of 2018.

People have been trying for a long time to create a tradable market for diamonds. Now, CEDEX has developed the technology and know-how to actually pull it off. This is the kind of opportunity that doesn’t come around very often.

This course does not assume you know any of the above terms. It assumes that you know what a node is and towards the end, it assumes that you know the probability of getting Tails, if you flip a coin.

For those who already know Distributed systems, this is an intro to distributed systems and because the area of research is so large, I was forced to remove any information that would not help the consensus module which comes after.

In the consensus module which is being made, the aim is to analyse as many consensus protocols as possible in crypto, using terminology that was learnt from 'Intro To Distributed Systems' where applicable.

&amp;nbsp;

1) We all know that block.one isn't actually *launching* an EOS blockchain. But is the EOS software being developed by block.one complete, ready-to-launch source code for a blockchain, or merely a framework that a 3rd party can work with to develop/launch their own blockchain?

I had a debate with another redditor a little while back, and I argued that EOS software would - by design - need additional work to customize and fill in the gaps in order to make it a functional blockchain. As evidence of this, I pointed out that in the whitepaper it stated that any virtual machine is independent of the actual EOS software, meaning that any would-be launcher of an EOS mainnet would (at the very least) need to develop their own VM implementation to create a working blockchain capable of supporting DApps. Is that a correct assessment, or do I not know what I'm talking about here?

https://github.com/EOSIO/Documentation/blob/master/TechnicalWhitePaper.md#scripts--virtual-machines

&amp;nbsp;

2) Is there really no guarantee that EOS ERC20 tokens will be transferred to mainnet tokens? See question 21 from the FAQ for more details on what I'm referring to.

https://eos.io/faq

So *in theory* there's nothing stopping someone from launching an EOS blockchain that completely ignores all the ERC20 EOS tokens/holders? But in order to launch a successful EOS blockchain, you would need to obtain the votes of holders of &gt;15% of the outstanding EOS ERC20 tokens, correct? Meaning that in practice any would-be blockchain launcher would be inclined to honor the ERC20 tokens in order to get votes.

*Edit:* I was recently reminded that EOS software is all open source, which would seem to mean that anyone could remove the requirement for 15% of the vote. Is this the case, and if so, what incentive is there for someone launching an EOS blockchain to reward EOS ERC20 token holders?

&amp;nbsp;

Also, please let me know if you think I'd be better off posting this somewhere else (e.g. r/cryptocurrency or r/altcoin).

&amp;nbsp;

*Edit2:* Ok, I now see that one big thing I was missing is that there's a semi-official EOS mainnet being launched by the established BPs, which is pretty much guaranteed to award native tokens based on the ERC20 snapshot. Not knowing that, I had been thinking there'd just be a hodge podge of various EOS-based blockchains by all sorts of 3rd parties, none of which had any particular incentive to respect the EOS ERC20 tokens, and with none of them being a distinct *main*net.","false","8g2a65",NA,0,NA,"false",1529661695,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","DEVELOPMENT",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/8g2a65/couple_questions_regarding_eos_software_and_token/","t3_8g2a65",NA,NA,"DEVELOPMENT","",0,0

Which, of course, is *many*  orders of magnitude beyond what ethereum can do today. 

My understanding of these is limited, but this is what I know about these technologies so far:

Dfinity

* PoS

* has a blockchain
* unbounded capacity-  capacity increases with each node (no idea how they achieve this-  whitepaper doesn't mention it, but they have other papers I havn't read). 
* at its heart is an innovative random number beacon that chooses the leader for each round
* will use solidity + others

Hedera Hashgraph

* no normal 'consensus mechanism', no blockchain, no leaders, novel 'gossip' protocol
* extremely high throughput (250k advertised transactions)
* unclear how it plans to achieve high computational or storage capacity (the hashgraph tech only allows high transaction speeds, to my understanding, not high computational or storage capacity)
* not open source (code is visible but forks are illegal)
* will use solidity

Rchain

* PoS
* uses new language, Rholang 
* don't know any further details, only discovered it recently, currently reading whitepaper :)

Does anyone have any thoughts/input about how these projects relate to each other? Is my understanding above correct? Are they all competitors, or are they doing different things? Is there an obvious front runner among these? Are there any similar projects I've missed?

I know that is what most people hope for but it doesn't seem plausible.


1. Why would you spend something you think will gain value, on lets say a pair of socks?


2. Why would any business accept a currency that has the potential to decrease in value?


3. Cryptos are mostly anti-government. Why would a business accept payment in a currency that they cannot pay taxes/bills with, and will owe extra taxes on if they gain value?


4. Finally, the only way all of this would work is if the cryptocurrency in question is completely stable. Which leads to the question, what then would be the point?



Cryptos have been classified as assets, they are somewhere in between straight fiat and a stock. In my point of view they are almost like the worst of both worlds....a fiat that can change value rapidly and a stock that's value isn't determined by the company its associated with. 


Disclaimer: I am a huge believer in blockchain technology and their future...but cryptocurrencies themselves seems to have no real use.

I could be remembering details wrong, or misunderstanding some things. Please be appropriately skeptical of the claims I am making in this post.

A thing that I had been thinking about for a while was that, given the most recent block of a blockchain, proving that a particular previous block is indeed a previous block of it, takes a number of steps linear in the number of blocks since the previous block. Or, at least, I believe this is the case for almost all blockchains that are being used. To make it worse, if the person who is checking the proof doesn't already have the record of the in-between blocks, then they would have to receive that data from the network before they could verify that they all link up properly.

I believe that this is why, for example, the EVM (from Ethereum), allows contracts to fetch information about the most recent 50(?) blocks, but doesn't allow checking information about blocks before that.

In thinking about this, I thought of something which I later found that other people had already come up with, and which I think improves on this.

(spoiler warning: it is the title of this post)

The idea would be to have, in addition to each block having the hash of the previous block, to have every other block also have the hash of the block 2 blocks before, every 4th block have the hash of the block 4 blocks before, and so on, arranged like a skip list. (if storing each of the hashes separately, this would only take amortized space twice as many hashes as if each block only stored one, and )

This way, it would only take approximately O( log_2 (n) ) steps to verify that a given block did happen at the stated time in the past of a particular block (where n is how many blocks ago the block being checked was). In addition, only around log_2(n) blocks would be needed to confirm.

When I looked for information about this, I found that a paper was made about this sort of data structure in 2003, under the name of ""authenticated append only skip lists"". https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0302010 . (except, obviously, they were not applying it to blockchains)

So, to be clear, I am /not/ claiming to have come up with anything novel. I have not. None of what I am describing is a novel result that I have introduced. (I thought of much of it independently, but other people had already thought of it, thought it through more carefully, and published it. This is not surprising.)

Ok so here is my question: When looking to see if any cryptocurrencies were using these in their blockchains in place of, uh, ""authenticated append only linked lists"" ( &lt;-- probably not an actual term people use), the only example I could find was blockstack.

(side note: something that the people at blockstack thought of that I did not think of, was instead of the rare blocks which are storing the hashes of many previous blocks storing the hashes separately, instead storing them in a merkle tree, so that it only takes up one hash worth of storage space.)

So, my question (for real this time): Why aren't other blockchains doing the same thing? This seems to me like it should be a useful property for one to have. Am I overestimating the benefit of being able to verify a block's distant ancestors cheaply? Are there maybe additional incentive or security issues with this setup that I haven't been able to think of? Other downsides that I am underestimating / not noticing?

(Note : I am not advocating for blockstack. I know very little about how blockstack works. My impression is that it is supposed to be a blockchain that is built on top of another blockchain? I am kind of confused about all that. I just found it because I was looking to see if anyone used the AASL idea in a blockchain project)

Anyway, uh,  
thoughts?

Please let me know if I accidentally stepped on any norms, or anything like that. Feedback welcome (including on how I organized this post here).

Even though the main net code has not been shown yet, a lot of the believers point to the fact that the last testnet ran on the old BTC code \+ ""PoSign"" \(Proof of Signature\), for some form of proof.

As a curiosity, I compared the ""PoSign"" \(no one is actually sure what Proof of Signature does fully\) implementation to the original code. Its around 150 lines or so. Apparently it was an emergency implementation and is a ""very light implementation of PoSign"" according to a community team member. I'm a Java developer, but not familiar with the original BTC code. Was wondering if someone who is, can review it for context and provide a little more insight on what it's doing?

Looks like part of it is a copy/paste of other code, but that happens in software development. Interestingly enough, CBlock::SignPoSignBlock\(int64\_t nFees\)  is never called.

The severity of this bug was high as it allowed malicious actors to create an extraordinarily large number of tokens and deposit them their own address.

In quick response to this vulnerability, on April 25, Huobi Pro announced that they would be halting withdrawals and deposits of all coins as a batchOverflow bug was found in the smart contract of a project called SmartMesh(SMT). 
Huobi’s First Announcement: https://www.huobi.pro/zh-cn/notice_detail/?id=1383

Huobi later announced that the suspension would only be applicable to ERC-20 tokens as the bug was found to only affect ERC-20 smart contracts. Withdrawals and deposits of non ERC-20 tokens were shortly resumed.
Huobi’s Second announcement: https://www.huobi.pro/notice_detail/?id=1392

Huobi Pro’s prompt action was well received by its users as they were reassured that the safety and security of their assets was Huobi’s top priority.

Other exchanges such as OKEX responded to the issue by suspending deposits of all ERC-20 tokens. Meanwhile Poloniex announced that via their official twitter channel that they would be suspending transactions.

Huobi Pro users, however, needn’t fret as their funds are in safe because of the timely actions taken by the exchange. Security continues to remain a top concern for Huobi and the team continues to remain vigilant when it comes to malicious attacks.

A system that includes incentivizing rewards will always encourage certain actors to accumulate as much of the rewards as possible. As long as it is profitable to do so, these actors will continue to increase their share of reward distribution. This is just simple motivation to increase profit that is seen in all economic systems. This motivation for profit creates centralizing pressure. For PoS this means accumulating more coins to stake and for PoW it means accumulating more hashing power. I would postulate that the greater the reward, the greater the profit motivation and the greater the centralizing pressure.
  
Consider that when it comes to participating in and securing a network, the incentivizing rewards must scale with the cost of participation to make participation profitable at a worthwhile margin. If rewards are too low, then participation will also be low and the network will be vulnerable. It is also the case that a higher cost of participation leads to a lower percent of users able to participate. To summarize, when cost of participation is high, rewards scale accordingly and these rewards are distributed to fewer participants.

For a PoW system, cost of participation is very high. These costs are associated with the hardware required and the electric power needed to run the hardware. There is also the phenomenon that as participation increases so does hashing difficulty, leading to even further increases in costs.

Therefor as participation in a PoW system grows, costs grow, rewards grow, and the number of users participating decreases. Essentially PoW systems are inherently and fundamentally under a great amount of pressure to become centralized due to their high costs. And in the end this is all funded by users through either direct transaction fees, or indirectly through inflation (newly mined coins) that devalues users holdings.

ASIC mining greatly exacerbates the problems that I discuss above by allowing certain actors with access to large amounts of resources to be able to greatly increase their participation (in terms of hasing power) in the network. However, I believe that even if ASIC mining could be defeated forever, the centralizing pressure of PoW would still exist due to the inherent costs of such a system. There will always be inequalities in terms of who is able to afford the most hardware and who has access to cheap electricity.

In my opinion the best protocols are the ones that have the lowest associated costs. Lower costs allow for more individuals to participate, for rewards to be lower, and for less cost to be passed on to users. Therefor the centralizing pressure on low cost systems is much less in addition to these systems being able to maintain lower fees and lower inflation.","false","8baktc",NA,0,NA,"false",1529575331,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","MINING-STAKING",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/8baktc/why_i_think_pow_is_fundamentally_flawed/","t3_8baktc",NA,NA,"MINING-STAKING","",0,1

Thanks!","Hi, any advice appreciated. (I'm looking specifically for a platform that can be used now btw if possible)

I'm looking for a platform/token that offers Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC). As decentralised as possible, but some ""trusted 3rd party"" solution is acceptable.

From what I can see, Enigma, Keep Network, Cardano, LemoChain, ChainLink, iExec, and Insights Network should all allow some level of this but many are not yet launched (or their staff are unresponsive and stupid). Golem might. Oraclize, TrueBit, and others might offer a workaround. I;ve read that this could just be done on Ethereum or even the Bitcoin blockchain, but I seriously doubt it would be ""Secure"" and not just ""Multiparty Computation""!

In terms of non-functional requirements, the computation I'm trying to do is extremely basic, so a really hacky and resource innefficient solution would not be a problem! I'm not talking about intensive computation.

Thanks for any advice!

Im aware of homomorphic encryption and zero proofs, but is there anything else? Obfuscation is also an option but not a good one as it could probably be deobfuscated given a determined individual.

With Enigma you have homomorphic encryption which basically means the sensitive dApp data is encrypted. but third parties can still get useful outputs from the cypher text e.g. a dApp where all your personal information is encrypted but can provide an output to verify who you are, think global know your customer KYC. It solves this problem, an old cryptography problem where 2 millionares want to know who is richer without giving their total wealth without a third party https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao%27s_Millionaires%27_Problem So far Enigma seems to be the only protocol offering this. Though i did see Ontology offering it plus Zero proofs, but there isn't much technical information on that coin so im in a wait and see mode given its huge market cap and lack of good technical explanations on how their protocol will work, but i digress, this post isnt about ontology or engima, its about how to protect data in general, what protocols are available to do this?

In the case of ethereum we have Zero Proofs, which are basically a less powerful form of homomorphic encryption, they essentially provide a yes / no output from the scenario above but without as rich a data set from the output (please correct me if im wrong on this)

Anything else worthy of discussion on ensuring private data on a dApp would be great too. I think this is a huge issue with mass adoption of dApps over centralised solutions controlled by a third party e.g. software as a service from a traditional software company where their application is hosted in house. Or an easier example, a bank. banks provide an immutable ledger like btc, but all your data is private because the bank controls the data and only provides information to verified customers through their web applications i..e their website where you login, you can see your your balance for example.","false","8czubx",NA,0,NA,"false",1529606056,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","2",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/8czubx/protecting_sensitive_data_in_smart_contract/","t3_8czubx",NA,NA,"2.0","",0,0

originay i posted this in /r/oyster but didnt get any good discussion, ill prob hit up telgram tech chan once i read the shl paper again and do a bit more digging, but id like what ppls thoughts are here. there is a bunch of questions i asked bruno about oyster i posted in this sub, u can find it in my post history, hes head architect / ceo.

right now, shl will provide a hybrid system, you can connect via the internet, via wifi or blue tooth, but the network coverage of wifi blue tooth would not be enough by far to gain access to the full network. overseas? forget about it , you would need the internet at this day and age, future might be different refer to this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_mesh_network.  at the end of the day. i dont see the hybrid system going away any time soon. which adds questions to regulation. oyster is ideal for long term static storage and also video streamin, with shl it supports dApps. so we have basically a second internet. ref to my bruno q&amp;a on this sub if u want a bit more detail on that

As for the hybrid system going away entirely, we would need a highly connected network coverage of wifi or other ways of transmitting data. i mentioned this in the first paragraph, but i wonder if its possible to truly create a separate internet without ISPS that everyone in the world can access, is the technology available? what would it look like? This is years down the road, the current infrastructure is just not available yet to move away from a hybrid system. the wikilink about meshnets gives some insights. 

In regards to oyster being perfect for video streaming and static data. it got me thinking. what happens when nefarious activities start appearing on SHL like on TOR, kiddy porn sites for example, dark net markets, terrorism sites. isps could b ordered to cut off access to shl network by law. however not all government would implement the law most likely... also begs the question if isps could even ban access to the network in practice.

question not sure if anyone here can answer, i might hit up telegram:

- is there any governance over the dApp in oyster running on shl on what it is doing? say if someone developed a kiddy porn site on oyster hosted on SHL network or a dark net market. people can then access that in the hybrid system. which will rise eye brows by authorities. they let TOR get a free pass because its actually wanted and funded by the govt. its useful for getting journalist info out for example, but has a dark side too. as will perhaps oyster dApps.

Nefarious dApps would have been an obvious concern to the oyster team. since you have TOR as a perfect example of a seperate accessible ""internet' via the internet (not really the same thing, but you get my drift).

you could say you could ban tor, i thought this would be hard but i posted on /r/TOR if this is feasible, and apparently its quite easy to do you can find it in my post history if you would like to know the details. even so if people somehow managed to still host TOR they are doing so at legal risk requiring secuirty measures with no financial incentive. while oyster on the other hand has financial incentive.

has this been addressed? what are peoples thoughts on this?

as an aside, i was also quite disapointed by the SHL whitepaper compared to the PRL one. not enough detail on how the protocol will operate. in the conclusion it mentioned shl / oyster will form a gigantic super computer. i dont see how this is posible at all unless the wording is wrong. its basically providing a second internet but built ontop of a shl meshnet which provides access to cpu, ram, memory and oyster for data wchich allows dApps. the monetisation of the system requires ppl buying data. people can earn revenue by running the oyster script on their site as a web node. however in the shl paper it mentions web nodes can also also earn shl and b incentivised to forming a gateway via reputation, which was not clear to me in the white paper as how that would work or why even use web nodes (browsers on a site with the prl script)

If yes, why do you think that?","In a time of the bear market we have an excellent opportunity -- to learn new concepts, dig through new projects on the scene and educate ourselves in the crypto sphere. 

While doing just that I've stumbled on [Hyperledger](https://www.hyperledger.org/) from IBM (which you've all probably heard of already but just to mention a few words for those who don't know what it is):

Hyperledger is a permissioned blockchain developed under the roof of the IBM. It is meant to be used by businesses which are in need of a shared ledger. That need may come in form of some collaboration between companies, states, departments, really between any two parties who have a lack of trust from the start. The *permissioned* means that the parties that are sysadmins of that blockchain can (and are) deciding who can read the ledger, write to the ledger, alter the ledger and they can add clearances for certain levels of the aforementioned ledger. It brings ultra-high security of the information, it encrypts the data which significantly lowers the chances of some kind of a leak (khm, khm, pointing at you [Equifax](https://www.ftc.gov/equifax-data-breach)). The positive side of it is that it can't be read by anyone like the public versions of blockchains we see nowadays, the negative side is that it loses decentralization which is one of the reasons blockchain was constructed back in '09.  

So back to the original question: why would an XY company use Z cryptocurrency for anything really when the price of it can change dramatically in a course of one day and it can affect their business? What logical economic reason can an XY company have to use a public cryptocurrency? How could their board of investors agree to use it when one day they may lose 30% of the original price because of, let's say, a sudden ban in Korea (imaginary scenario, just for the sake of discussion)? Also, if they would use a Z cryptocurrency as, let's say, a token which you can use to pay for some of their services online, or maybe they use it just to store some information in the blockchain, why do it publicly? That isn't secure for their information when anyone can read it in the blockchain. True, one could argue that their information is then decentralized and they really can't lose it if there ever comes some kind of a big hardware problem on their servers, but they could also decentralize the permissioned ledger all around the world exponentially lowering chances of a complete loss. 

I see the use of cryptocurrencies in the form of banking between parties without the use of banks really so they can cut out the costs of intermediaries. I even see the use of them on some platforms that use the token to pay for something between parties (decentralized Airbnb or even eBay maybe). I also see the use in ICOs which is a great tool for smaller businesses to get the funding they need and not needing to deal with big VCs like they needed until now. But what incentive could a big company have to get into cryptocurrencies? 

What are your thoughts on this subject guys? What am I missing in the whole picture? Am I overlooking something?

There are a few cryptocurrencies that can scale linearly already, i.e. the more number of nodes they have, the more transactions the network can process. (Cardano, IOTA, Zilliqa)

However, this isn't the case for our 1st generation blockchains unfortunately. In fact, they have decided to solve the scalability problem with an off chain solution, the Lightning Network.

While doing research on it, I found numerous posts specifying a myriad of flaws in the Lightning Network's concept and implementation. More specifically, within these 3 sources 

1. A collection of all the flaws in the white paper https://www.np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/71i6y3/a_brief_teardown_of_some_of_the_flaws_in_the/?st=JFI7PRN9&amp;sh=02722e1b
2. A quick summary of the major LN flaws https://www.np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/874clf/comment/dwacpus?st=JFI7ODZQ&amp;sh=5e7962e9
1. A description of an attack to steal 400 BTC from users through the Lightning Network
https://www.np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/84n8l0/comment/dvs4n25?st=JFI7QHQ2&amp;sh=dc3588b1

This brings me to the conclusion that the Lightning Network makes Bitcoin heavily insecure.  Is anyone informed about this and can say if these claims are legitimate?

Is there anything out there that actually has the potential to actually scale both in terms of transactions per second and keeping the blockchain size in check?

I know sharding is an option but there seems to be question marks about whether it will actually even work. If it doesn't all the layer 2 stuff in the world probably wouldn't be enough for Ethereum or a similar crypto to really become a true 'world computer' as the writes back to the blockchain would still be too much for the scale we are talking about with widespread use.

What other layer one scaling options are there? If blockchains fail to scale what becomes of them?

We’re the [district0x](https://district0x.io/) team, here to talk about decentralized markets and how we’re decentralizing the ownership structures of the world's marketplaces. Ask us anything!**

**Team**:
Hello, /u/Bradymck (Brady) and /u/misterpeej (PJ) here (marketing and community management) from the district0x team. Ask us anything about district0x’s technology stack (IPFS, Aragon, IPFS, d0xINFRA). 

We’ll be taking your questions about anything you may be curious about.

---

**For a breakdown**: The district0x project is building a general purpose framework of smart contracts and front-end libraries for the purpose of deploying, operating, and governing communal marketplaces.The network is powered by Ethereum smart contracts, ‘Aragon’ governance and the distributed file system ‘IPFS’. 

By taking a modular approach, budding developers can utilize our platform to build any marketplace they can dream up. Some examples of marketplaces people are building can be seen on our [github repository](https://github.com/district0x/district-proposals/issues).

The markets we have launched on the ethereum mainnet can be seen as modular templates to build on top of. [Ethlance](https://ethlance.com/) (Freelance job board) was our first and provides basic market functions,[Name Bazaar](https://namebazaar.io/) (ENS name exchange) was our second market and is the primary standardized framework that will give the modular structure to all future districts. 

[Meme Factory](https://memefactory.io/) is our third market and will provide basic curation market functions (aside from Aragon, this is key to managing a decentralized community). After this point we will have what we call d0xINFRA which will be the developer tools the public will use to create their own markets. 

For a closer look at what we are building, our ‘[Nutshell](https://blog.district0x.io/the-district0x-network-in-a-nutshell-864a391e0b4)’ article and [introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imhD3EJGWE) will dig into how the network will work. For a deeper dive here's our [white paper](https://district0x.io/docs/district0x-whitepaper.pdf).

Let’s do this!

I hope you folks are well! I have a question about Origin Trail and have been striking out on answers. I have read the white paper and am having trouble wrapping my head around Data Creator and Data Holder nodes. Specifically why we need both of them in the Network Layer.  

From a distributed systems perspective, nodes in a peer to peer network can operate as both data publishers and storers depending on the request sent to them. If you are publishing to a p2p network and you contact a node that does not host the information you are publishing, the node will basically forward the information to where it is supposed to go. The same if you are retrieving information. An information search and retrieval protocol is usually implemented so that you can contact any node and get the information stored in a different location.

All this to say, it seems like DC nodes and DH node could just be the same thing. If you want to publish supply chain info, you send that to a node which checks the blockchain, finds where to publish the content, and publishes it. This is currently done by two types of nodes, but it seems to me that it could be done by one type of node.

I'm sure I'm missing something, so if someone could fill me in on the importance of having both DC and DH nodes I would really appreciate it!","false","8e92tw",NA,0,NA,"false",1529628963,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","DISCUSSION",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/8e92tw/an_origin_trail_question/","t3_8e92tw",NA,NA,"FOCUSED DISCUSSION","",0,0

If anyone wants to have me make effort to ask a specific question of the developers while there I would be glad to.

I hope to possibly crate utility personally with ravencoin to monetize my sail charter efforts.  I have not conceptualized my goals yet,  but I believe I would like to create a cryto deposit/scheduling utility that could be of use in low volume, moderate value specifically time scheduled services.    My goal is to be able to have my sailing services be booked,  to have my boat working as much as possible.    

The token issuance aspect of Ravencoin could allow me to create a local co op around my sailing,  with ability to push dividends to holders of my token,  of which I imagine I will initially issue between 100 and 1000.    None of this is firm.

SPV wallets like BreadWallet connect to random nodes in the Bitcoin network to verify that their transaction was approved, or notify them of any transactions that they have received. The private keys are safely stored with the Wallet. The SPV Wallet does not fully trust the node it has connected to and so they have the ability to double check that the transaction was indeed included in a specific block.

API Wallets connect to a node such as blockchain.info or any other node that is willing to give them data via an API. They use blockchain.info for example, to feed them the information they need about their wallet. The private keys are safely stored with the wallet. The API Wallet must trust the blockchain.info node and has no way to verify the information they are given. They can choose to connect to multiple block explorers and nodes to double check the information they are given.

Points about SPV and API Wallets:

- SPV Wallets are normally slower than API Wallets. This is because you may find yourself connected to a slow node amongst other things. More reasons on why SPV is slow, should be implicitly assumed amongst some of the following points.

- If you import a private key into an SPV Wallet, it must query the blockchain from the beginning, as SPV Wallets need to syncronise with the blockchain.

- SPV Wallets gives the user better security, due to validation checks and somewhat better privacy. The more private the SPV Wallet is, the more you will have to download from the random node. Essentially, you ask the node for your transactions, plus a couple of random transactions, making it hard for him to guess which ones are yours. The longer you connect to him, the easier it will be for him to guess. The more random information you ask for the hard it will be. However, you will have to download more information. You have to draw a middle ground with the bloom filter.

- Most Wallets that use SPV, use a hybrid approach, for example Electrum uses SPV however the nodes they connect to are their own high quality servers.

- The storage space that SPV Wallets use is negligible in the case of Bitcoin, it would be around 4.2MB a year. 

In the case of Ethereum, the block header is ~500 bytes. (See Section4.4 in Ethereum Yellow Paper) With block times being ~20 seconds, SPV would not be scalable for Ethereum (788MB). Ethereum are building a different protocol named Light Ethereum Subprotocol (LES). I have not calculated how much storage this protocol will consume. 

As more cryptocurrencies want shorter block times, the SPV client will need to store more information. My question being is, whether you care about your wallet using SPV or API?

Bithumb, which regularly comprises around 25% of the world Ethereum trading volume, was hacked for billions of won. In the process, Bithumb users not only lost their money, but also had their names, phone numbers, and email addresses exposed.

Around three weeks later, BTC-e, one of the oldest digital currency exchanges, was effectively shut down by the U.S. government. The U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) laid down a $110 million USD fine against BTC-e, and a separate $12 million dollar fine for Alexander Vinnik, one of the operators of BTC-e.

More upsetting news came out when the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) released a link between BTC-e and the infamous Mt. Gox hacking, stating that BTC-e accounts “received substantial proceeds” from Mt. Gox, and netted funds from Cryptowall, one of its biggest ransomware attacks. The U.S. DOJ condemned BTC-e, stating, “BTC-e was an international money-laundering scheme that, by virtue of its business model, catered to criminals — and to cyber criminals in particular.”

Upon reading this news, no one cant say which was more disturbing; the fact that Bithumb lost large sums of customer funds/private information, and is still somehow one of the largest exchanges in the world, or that BTC-e was running a giant money-laundering scheme right under our nose. BTC-e at least got shut down, but the Bithumb hacking didn’t really seem to affect the exchange at all. Besides the outraged customers who were hacked, everyone else pretty much seemed to move on, business as usual.

It seems like everyone is just used to exchange hackings now. They’ve become a part of the crypto industry. When there’s a hacking, most people just think “Whew, glad I didn’t have funds in there” and move on. When massive security breaches aren’t met with much surprise anymore, there has to be a deeper underlying problem.

The main problem, is that there really are no viable alternatives to centralized exchanges at the moment. If someone hears that Bithumb got hacked and want to move funds away, where would he go? Probably go to another centralized exchange in Korea, like Coinone. The same problem still exists however. No one really knows how or why Bithumb got hacked, as the system is centralized, opaque, and closed. If someone moves funds to another centralized exchange, does any of that change? How do anybody get to know that the new exchange he sent funds to has better security protocols?

God forbid the OAX platform ever have a security breach, but if one were to occur, there are clear protocols in place. First of all, unlike centralized exchanges which hold both crypto and fiat private keys, Asset Gateways in the OAX platform will only have custody of a single set of keys. For example, with a fiat gateway, the gateway will only hold onto the fiat currency in a transaction, and the user will retain crypto custody. The vice versa applies for crypto gateways.

Asset Gateways will also have transparent collateral levels, so that users can determine the amount of risk that they want to take on in a trade. The whole system will be open-sourced and transparent, so that everyone can check if there are potential loopholes. If the platform were to get hacked, it won’t be just us knowing why it happened. Everyone would be able to see why the system got hacked, and make changes accordingly. Essentially, if we were running a giant money-laundering scheme like BTC-e, you’d know about it. If thousands of our users had their funds and private information hacked, you’d know how and why it happened.

At this point, people probably wondering about liquidity. Liquidity is the main reason why centralized exchanges are still popular even with all of the recent hackings. As mentioned previously, the Bithumb hacking barely made a dent in the overall business of the exchange, and its liquidity rankings are still consistently one of the best in the world. OAX hopes to solve the liquidity issue for decentralized exchanges by lowering entrance barriers for Asset Gateways and aggregating order books, which you can read more about in detail here.

OAX believes, that someone, or some team, has to take charge and create an ecosystem that people can put their trust in. It doesn’t have to be only OAX that leads this charge, even though we do believe strongly in the project. There seems to be some glimmer of a hint that regulation may be coming.

I know this is not strictly technical, but it sort of is and I know not where else to post this and get a sensible answer. If mods do not agree this post is technical enough, please feel free to remove it and I will ask the questions elsewhere.
I originally posted this as a response to a comment on another coin but I wanted to approach a group that may have a better understanding of what the answer may be.
I ask this question here because i think the technology is sound but it has been 10 years since BTC was mined and despite there being many alts, I do not see many really usurping current companies or really solving problems that do not already have a fairly good solution.  

So, to start, are businesses really going to want to put everything on the blockchain? A lot of information they have is either proprietary or pertains to their cost basis and hence profit margins which they do not really want you and I as shoppers to know. In that instance, wouldn't they just create an internal ledger that tracked stock and finances etc that we would never see, and that wouldn't use a coin? Much like Linux works in the background on mobile operating systems and in the cloud.
If that is the case, are there blockchain developers currently building systems like this? 

Secondly, and I know we are early stages and this will likely come, but interface and usability is key. At the moment, I can't read anything on the blockchain that makes any real sense to me, and I sure as hell don't know how to add a smart contact. Think of SAP, a massive company that does everything backend for companies, from HR, Finance, purchasing, sales, and a myriad of other things. This is all done on a ledger and anyone can use it within a company and most data cannot be changed by just anyone, plus you have change logs if anyone does try to change it. How is blockchain going to usurp the incumbent? Why would people move to a blockchain?

Text of the blog included. 

Less then two months ago we commented on how ACES could be levered to support ARK ICOs for Push-Button-Blockchains. Today, we’ve launched the protocol to support this. We’re calling it ARKA-ARKB channel services. Combining this service with the already released ARK Deployer from the ARK team will allow you to connect your independent ARK blockchain to the ARK main chain (or any other ARK network) to exchange between the tokens. For another guide on ARK Deploy see this guide on using Azure for ARK Deployer.

What’s the difference between ARK-A and ARK-B?

These are simply ARK network variables, and they can be any ARK-based chain. For example, the default in our repository sets ARKA to the ARK mainnet and ARKB to the ARK devnet. Simply adding your independent blockchain’s network config to the network config directory and then replacing the arkbNetworkConfigPath with the correct network config location will replace ARKB with your new network, and your new token will be connected and for sale when you boot the ACES application.

Why is this awesome?

Starting an ICO or any other tokenized project and monetizing it through any connected blockchains is super easy now. We are approaching an era where launching an independent blockchain with connections to other blockchain services (like transfer and contract) can be done from start to finish in less than an hour. We’ve already have several interested parties in working with ACES to support their project in some way.

You can have your project tokens for sale in less than a few hours of work, as a complete beginner. With a robust ACES marketplace, you could be connected to all sorts of coins and receive funding in any coin that has available capacity only by connecting your service to ARK through this newly released service. This is because ACES channel services can be linked together. A diagram of the flow of a linked-channel-service is shown below. Just replace ETH with ARKB, and you can see how an ARK ICO can accept Bitcoin to sell their new tokens.

The ARK ICO concept can succeed without any other ACES service providers, because the project hosts become an ACES service provider with large capacity of their network available for transfer. This means even if there isn’t enough capacity on the ACES platform for external coins like Bitcoin, ARK can be very successful for launching ICOs and independent blockchains.

Brand new chains that do not have, and may never have, listing on exchanges will be available through ARK using the chains available and liquid ACES service. This makes ARK competitive with easy ICO options like Ethereums ERC20 tokens, but the ARK-based tokens would reside on their own independent blockchain and not produce any bloat for non-users.

As a user/investor, you will not need to ever worry about registering ERC20 tokens for eventual transfer to a mainnet, as this can be easily facilitated with custom ACES services and ARK Push-Button-Blockchains, which as mentioned already, can be set up by projects before their first coffee break of the day.

Next steps

We will now return to enhancing the ACES marketplace, with security audits, adding searchable services, easy deployments, and more. The next month will focus primarily on security audits and UI improvements for what we already have released, and then afterwards we will focus on admin tools for easy deployments and service monitoring.

Join the team!

We’re on the look out for more contributors. We welcome any one to contribute to the project. Here are some contributions we’d love to receive some focus:

More coin services. Linking external blockchains to ARK and using our existing repos as guides. Our top desired connection is Monero to ARK. If you want to take this one, reach out! You will need to know Java and Spring-boot to work closely with our existing repos, but this is not a requirement if you want to implement in other ways. Marketplace feature build out. We use Angular for the front-end. If you are interested in learning more about Angular or contributing to an Angular project, we’d love help in this area! You do not need to be expert, and all code will be reviewed by the team. Tutorials and guides. Do you not have much technology experience and just want to learn how to use and teach how to launch ACES services and chains? We’d love for some people to put together tutorial blogs, videos, etc, that show how to launch an ARK-based chain alongside an ACES service. Service providers. It would be great to have some people hosting ACES services with some non-zero mainnet capacity. This is a legitimate business opportunity, and you would be able to be a profitable business by using the integrated ACES service fees.","false","8d61gp",NA,0,NA,"false",1529609319,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","DEVELOPMENT",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/8d61gp/ark_aces_completes_integration_of_ark_channels/","t3_8d61gp",NA,NA,"DEVELOPMENT","",0,1

It will be interesting to see how LN will turn out once it's being more adopted.

These questions come do mind, can anyone answer them? 

1. How can the TPS for Eth with Sharding and for BTC with the Lightning Network be calculated? Is it based on the number of nodes using LN or Sharding?
2. Is there a similar calculation for finding out the TPS of Nano or IOTA based on their number of Nodes in the network?
3. Since Cardano, Zilliqa and IOTA scale linearly, does it mean their scalability is very bad or very good? For example, Zilliqa advertises itself as a high troughput crypto, do they maybe mean something else with scaling linearly?
4. Does Bitcoin currently scale negatively, i.e. the more number of nodes, the less TPS. Why?
5. Could Bitcoin use Sharding instead of LN, why/why not?

Good stablecoin, I think not.

Stablecoins \(SBC\) seek to create a perfectly elastic supply of 1 USD assets. Ideally, it is possible for the users to buy or sell as many SBC as they wish with the price fixed at 1 USD. Existing/proposed systems are not well\-designed. I will focus on design flaws in existing collateralized systems here.

Systems such as MakerDao and bitshares require their users to escrow a quantity of cryptocurrency collateral to create a tradeable asset \(Dai\) and \(bitUSD\). In order to recover escrowed collateral, users must repurchase a quantity of Dai or bitUSD they previously created. If the value of the escrowed collateral drops below 1.25\-1.75 of the Dai/bitUSD it supports, these systems force a margin call and collateral auction to repurchase Dai/bitUSD. In this procedure a penalty rate is applied to the collateral \(say 10&amp;#37;\) and then the collateral is auctioned off at a discount \(of say 3\-10&amp;#37;\). The auction proceeds are used to repurchase outstanding Dai/bitUSD. After the auction and penalty, any remaining balance is returned to the user.

These approaches are seriously flawed. Firstly, by design the price of Dai/bitUSD spikes in anticipation of a collateral auction or anticipated repayment event. To understand why, note that the Dai or bitUSD user is severely penalized in the event of a margin call, losing \~16\+&amp;#37; of the value of collateral through combined effects of the penalty and auction discount. As a result, the Dai/bitUSD is better off purchasing Dai/bitUSD at a premium price up to $1.16 rather than allowing the auction to occur.

On the other side of the market, there is nothing to stop a single actor or group of actors from purchasing all the Dai/bitUSD in circulation and refusing to sell for less than \~$1.16, the buyer’s reserve price. As a result, these assets appreciate above $1 whenever a user attempts to buy them in significant quantities. Likewise, the price assets will fall below $1 if there is no near\-term prospect of a repayment event. To understand this, note that if the risk\-adjusted annual rate of return users demand for holding these assets is r and the repayment event at a premium over parity δ is expected to occur T years in the future, then the present value of the asset is  \(\(1\+δ\)/\(1\+r\)^(T) . In a market downturn, many users are forced to repurchase Dai/bitUSD to avoid margin calls, so that the expected time to repayment, T falls precipitously. The opposite occurs in a prolonged bull market. Due to this design flaw, Dai and bitUSD fail to achieve USD parity.

Figures 1 and 2 show that both Dai and bitUSD command premia

during and prior repayment events.

Figure 1: Break from Parity in First Large Repayment Event for Dai Stablecoin

\(In lieu of the figure, go to coinmarket cap and look at Dai's behavior on March 18th, where price spikes to $1.09 conncurrent with a 4 million dollar repayment event.\)

In Figure 1, note that the blue line is the Dai market cap. The Dai market cap decreases when Dai is repurchased by the user to recover collateral or when the collateral is force liquidated in a margin call. Here, note that the price of Dai \(green line\) begins to spike before the decrease in market cap where Dai is retired. In other words, Dai holders anticipate that someone will want to repurchase Dai to recover collateral and raise prices in response. This is a big problem for two reasons. Firstly, users supplying collateral to the system are likely unaware of this issue and may refuse to participate as the problem becomes more widely understood. Secondly, the system does not achieve parity.

Figure 2: Persistent Breakdown of Parity in bitUSD

\(In lieu of the figure, go to coinmarket cap and look at bitUSD behavior over the past 3 months.\)

Here, the price of bitUSD is much noisier as it is not actively manipulated by company\-controlled bots to give an appearance of stability. The noise should be ignored as this problem would resolve itself if the asset were in widespread use. The fundamental problem is the persistent premium on bitUSD that emerged concurrently with the decline in bitshares market price and the bitUSD market cap. Again, the issuers of bitUSD are required to purchase bitUSD at a premium in market downturns.

I'm tired, so forgive the missing figures/equations and bad writing. I'll fix it later.. Ask questions and I'll explain.

If anyone would like to hire me to design the first working stablecoin protocol, please get in touch. Yes, Tehter levels of parity are achievable in a fully decentralized system with excellent long\-term stablity. The best way of doing this is to incorporate a USD token in an existing cryptocurrency with additional useful properties and backing the SBC token using expansion and contraction of cryptocurrency supply. \(No, none of the other systems you see floating around that propose to do this will ever work.\) Yes, if you are working on one of these broken systems, I am happy if you hire me to fix it. This includes MakerDAO/bitUSD type systems which I could fix though they are not my preferred solution..","false","8cndm6",NA,0,NA,"false",1529599838,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","DISCUSSION",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/8cndm6/weakness_of_makerdaobitusd_mechanism/","t3_8cndm6",NA,NA,"FOCUSED DISCUSSION","",0,0

Similar to digital video, the stock photo market has its fair share of problems. For example, photographers normally get paid only a small percentage of earnings from their photos. Fund transfers can take a month or longer on most large platforms. Also, site verification is time consuming, and users aren’t able to price their photos.

A new startup,  Photochain , is utilizing blockchain and smart contracts to streamline all of these processes. They have created an efficient marketplace for users of all sizes. Content creators can earn upwards of 95% on their sales. Plus, payout time is mere seconds. Users can be assured that licensing and copyrights will be fully enacted due to the platforms Digital Copyright Chain (DCC).  

In addition, verification is simple and quick. Users can set their own price for their content. As the company grows and the technology continues to develop, photo professionals and enthusiasts should look out for companies like Photochain.

I smoothed the transactions over 14 days over the past 6 months to get a better view of the average transactions per day. I added in XRP because some banks are using / trilling x-rapid which is the only product from ripple that uses the XRP token. We see here that XRP and ethereum dominate. I realise ethereum is not a payment coin but it is used for that purpose. so i imagine a large amount of these transactions are smart contract executions. The transactions per day for ripple don't make sense to me as very few banks are trialling / using x-rapid. Anyone know why they are so high?

https://i.imgur.com/eeQOTOU.jpg

I also looked at the average transaction value smoothed over 7 days for 6 months, we see a different story. btc dominates followed by bitcoincash. XRP and monero are not listed here. XRP im not sure why, but monero its quite obvious since transaction amounts are private. Also whats interesting is that Ethereum is at the bottom, which i suspect is due to smart contract executions.

I realise this is in no way an indicator of itself of adoption, it ends up just raising more questions. What are people doing with the BTC? is it being used for payment i.e. actual adoption, or is it being simple traded by investors to buy alts, or people who are simply investing in BTC. BTCCash i would muse would actually indicate adoption as its not used as a trading pair, however its only doing 20k transactions per day, which is nothing compared to the others. The amount of XRP transactions has my head scratching as well. what could be the reason for this? xcurrent doesnt use the xrp token, only xrapid, and very few companies are using it, either in trial or production.

What do you guys think? 

here is the site i used to get the charts:

https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactionvalue-btc-eth-bch-ltc-xrp-dash-xmr-doge-sma14.html#6m

edit: thought i would add the average transaction fee since dec for some of the coins. notice how the transaction fees were so high in dec / jan for btc during the boom / crash , btc is limited in how much it can process per day, somewhere between 200k-300k tx per day:

However, I have no technical experience in crypto aside from knowledge of the basics, so I was wondering what people think. Also this isn't currency-related, I hope that's ok.

It's important that academics at universities are free to say what they think is true, and it would be nice if we could collect their opinions and present scientific consensuses to the public on various topics. However, it can often be the case that academics don't want their names associated with opinions on controversial topics such as abortion, IQ, sex differences, dualism, interpretations of QM, communism, and so on, because their career or public image could be jeopardized.

It would be nice if there was a system in place where academics could voice their opinions both anonymously, but with some proof of credibility. It would give the public a much clearer picture of what some of the most informed thinkers think, and to what extent they disagree. 

However, an immediate problem I see is an apparent contradiction between anonymity and credibility. I was wondering if this was something that crypto technology could help with. For example, maybe we could give every published academic a private key that would identify them on some kind of 'academic blockchain'? But then, how could the public trust the private key distributor? Is this a workable idea at all, and does anything of the sort already exist?","false","8hdwo7",NA,0,NA,"false",1529685604,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","DEVELOPMENT",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/8hdwo7/anonymous_credible_consensus/","t3_8hdwo7",NA,NA,"DEVELOPMENT","",0,0

I'm building this website, that is aimed to be something similar to a combination of ""Product hunt"" and ""Startup stash"". My vision of it is that it would encapsulate ""the state of blockchain"" versus ""resources for better understanding"", i.e. businessmen, investors (not traders) and enthusiasts could come into it and see what is the current atmosphere and how well adopted is blockchain in the world; additionally it could route them to a good direction. So far the website consists of two sections: ""Hand picked company profiles"" and ""About blockchain"". The later is just a collection of a few videos.

My question to you is, what sort of information (a visual or textual representation) would you consider a ""state of blockchain""? Also as an aside, maybe you have general tips or think this is a bad idea? If you feel that this is not the place to discuss this, then I'd appreciate if you directed me to the right community.

Can anyone explain where blockchain is worth the cost?","Programmer here, done database work, I dont understand why anyone would pay extra money for 'verified' data.

Here is my understanding, I'd rather learn than anything, so explain where I am wrong/correct.

Blockchain is a (public), verified, decentralized ledger. This has 1 advantage. If you dont trust everyone to agree about something, this solves the problem. I believe this is only useful in currency and voting. 

Blockchain is more expensive. It requires multiple computers to do the work of 1 computer. This is unavoidable and is how blockchain works. This makes whatever transaction/data more expensive and slower than a single computer. 

For media, facebook and google have done nothing wrong with hosting content without having this decentralized verification. I do not see how blockchain would ever ever ever make media better. 

For logistics, companies already have equipment that tracks temperature of shipments. Companies already have tracking mechanisms. They  dont use blockchain. Blockchain would only verify these already existing systems. Expensive with no benefits.

For your refrigerator and watch, IOT, blockchain isnt needed. Alexa and similar can already do this without paying people for this communication. 

I do not understand the benefits of blockchain for all the hyped up reasons. I think people are tossing the word  in-front of applications that should be centralized(or at least AWS).

In other words, what can be done so that our mother can use it intuitively?

One of the things I’ve been thinking about is mobile wallets, why hasn’t anyone made use of TouchID or FaceID, or other on-device hardware security features as the security mechanism instead of cumbersome seed phrases? What are the various technical challenges?

While this may be stored on device, what if we hashed your fingerprint signature with the private keys with something like Bcrypt, salt it, then split up the hash into a dozen different chunks, then distribute the chunks in a decentralized way. Is something like that possible? 

Then your device isn’t necessarily storing the entire chunk of the hashed private key, but rather just a directory of where the chunks of the hashed key is, so an attacker will have nothing of value even if they were to attack any single point. and then only by authenticating with TouchID or whatever security mechanism, you can then match the hash against all the chunks and access your wallet?

Theoretically, this would all be invisible to the user, and you will have a simple unlocking experience.

Then ofcourse there is the environment, Bitcoin mining uses the same amount of electricity as some small countries, and it will only grow. This is not sustainable and environmentally friendly.

PoS does protect against 51% attacks as getting 51% of all coins would never be worth it, but it is extremely centralized. The biggest coin holders can make technological changes without even asking the community or developers etc. 
There are a number of competitors to PoW and PoS, but today I would like to ask the tech savvy community here if ‘’Obelisk’’ has solved this, or is atleast a good contestant.

Obelisk, used by Skycoin, calls itself a ‘web-of-trust’ with no mining, but only nodes which can be computers or so called ‘’skyminers’’ (which unlike the name aren’t similar to ASICs). Each node subscribes to a trusted node and the nodes with more subscribers have more influence and power. Each of these nodes has a public record so you can check for cheating, manipulation etc.

It doesn’t use a lot of energy or resources and can be run on almost every device.

I'm just trying to picture how this sort of system would work. It doesn't come across like a MedicalChain-type project that wants your entire medical record on the ledger. They're just trying to record and share disease outbreak data. Would the CDC be asking every healthcare provider to use some app and input medical data when they have a patient with an infectious disease? What incentive is there to participate in this sort of system? Does anyone have an idea what this could look like?

When it comes to many of these healthcare blockchain projects, I just don't follow how data is getting into the blockchain. If I have my own medical data ""wallet"" and I control/permission all of my information -- that makes sense to me. But in a disease outbreak, it's not like the CDC is going to say ""sorry about your disease, can you create a wallet so we can put some medical data there and distribute it to the network?""

TLDR: When signing a value of 13 using the IOTA implementation the published signature is the privatekey for that WOTS. The private keys are generated using a broken KDF. The KDF allows complete internal state recovery from one private key. IOTA uses ‘normalization’ instead of checksums, this makes having the value 13 as the first value to sign much more likely. Address reuse was not required to exploit this. The current IOTA implementation doesn’t fix the KDF. Instead it does refuse to create any signatures that require the value of 13 to be signed, mitigating the vulnerability.","false","8l3kzo",NA,0,NA,"false",1529752675,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","DISCUSSION",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/8l3kzo/why_iota_cant_sign_the_number_13/","t3_8l3kzo",NA,NA,"FOCUSED DISCUSSION","",0,0

The brand-new ride-sharing service offered by Decentralised Alternative Cabs Servicing and Empowering Everyone (DACSEE) uses an e-wallet system powered by blockchain technology. A soft launch was held today and the app for the ride-sharing service is to be officially rolled out in April. Science, Technology &amp; Innovation Deputy Minister Datuk Abu Bakar Mohamad Diah attended the soft launch.

The DACSEE platform enables drivers to build their own fleet with partner drivers and users registering with DACSEE automatically become a rookie driver and passenger, which gives drivers and referees a 1-2% overriding commission in the form of DACSEE Token, offering opportunities to earn passive income.

On the part of the riders, the payment method is the same as for other ride-hailing services – with cash, debit card or credit card.

According to a media statement by the company, the tokens can be exchanged at any time into any world currency through authorised cryptocurrency exchanges.

DACSEE’s white paper published on its website revealed that the token is a “decentralised Ethereum ERC20 token that customers will use to pay for taxi rides in a cryptographically-secured, unstoppable fashion”.

“It will be distributed to ICO (initial coin offering) contributors automatically through the Ethereum network and will be accessible to all users online through the DACSEE Wallet App and in Google Play Store. Like all ERC20-compliant tokens, DACSEE tokens may be stored and transferred only with an Ethereum private key and can be used across platforms in many wallets compatible with Ethereum,” the white paper read.

However, at today’s soft launch, DACSEE COO and co-founder Lim Chiew Shan did not directly answer whether the token is a form of cryptocurrency, except to say that it is a “blockchain-based” technology. He also denied any multi-level marketing structure in its business model.

“The technology beneath DACSEE is blockchain because we want the payment to be as transparent as possible. If you are a driver, I deduct RM2 from you, you can check DACSEE’s account (to see) where this RM2 goes … this is why it is (called) crypto,” said Lim.

“The DACSEE token is a reward and the crypto is just a technology beneath it. We are not saying that one has to buy Dacsee tokens to pay. It is not a form of payment, it is basically a technology that runs the platform because we want it to be transparent,” he added.

DMD Technology Sdn Bhd, the app developer, was incorporated on Jan 2, 2018.

All stakeholders including the founders of the platform, drivers and referees will all be rewarded with this token. A driver will have to get three references in order to obtain a driver ID, as part of a verification process. One of the referees will be the Land Public Transport Commission (SPAD).

When contacted, a SPAD spokesperson confirmed that the company did engage with the commission, but stressed that it was merely at the preliminary level whereby the company’s business model had been presented. No approvals have been given.

The Securities Commission declined to comment when contacted regarding the new venture.

Besides Malaysia, DACSEE’s service has already been launched in Thailand. Bangkok Post reported on Dec 25 that the blockchain-based ride-sharing platform was in the ICO phase with the aim of raising US$20 million (3.9 billion baht).","false","8ho9nh",NA,0,NA,"false",1529690840,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","DEVELOPMENT",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/8ho9nh/new_ridehailing_service_dacsee_rides_on/","t3_8ho9nh",NA,NA,"DEVELOPMENT","",0,0

Here's an idea I came up with instead of sleeping.

So, Bitcoin became mainstream economic speculation, and the mind-boggling sums of money fueled into the crypto-ecosystem has been converted to mining operations feeding on electrical power equivalent to the entire nation of Ireland.

This is a lot of energy consumption that doesn't really add any real value to our societies on a human level, except to insure scarcity of certain currencies.

What I mean by ""class"", is a group of PoW algorithms that can all be mined by a single ASIC much faster than on a GPU or similar general-purpose hardware [note 1]. 

I hope that the answer is yes. 

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are often referred to as the digital equivalent to noble metals (e.g., ""digital gold"" for bitcoin, ""digital silver"" for litecoin). However, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies lack a key feature of gold, which is that gold cannot be copied. In other words, if everyone agrees that gold makes a reasonable store of value, no one can copy&amp;paste gold, and make ""gold cash"" or ""litegold"". Sure, there are other metals that can be used as a store of value or a means of exchange (copper, platinum, etc.); however, none will be exactly like gold. For example, gold is uniquely chemically stable, which makes it an excellent choice as a long-term store of value even when compared to other metals [note 2]. 

Despite bitcoin's groundbreaking way of creating digital scarcity, it *can* be directly copied, forked, etc., due to its open-source nature. The only thing that enforces the digital scarcity of bitcoin is the network effect -- the belief that *this* particular chain is the real one, and the active contributors (developers, partners, etc.) who refuse to migrate to another chain, no matter how similar it is to the first one. This means that *the scarcity of bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency is much weaker, in principle, than the scarcity of a noble metal* [note 3]. This is perhaps obvious given the many cryptocurrencies jockeying for market-cap position, and the declining market share of bitcoin (30-40% of the market today, compared to &gt;80% 1-2 years ago).

However, if the total number of classes of viable PoW algorithms is finite, then this problem automatically resolves itself. For example, imagine that somehow there are only 5 PoW-algorithm classes. That means that there can only be 5 cryptocurrencies based on PoW, because any minor currency that doesn't hold the leader position in a particular class is immediately at massive risk of a 51% attack [note 4]. This would be very similar to the scarcity of metals in the physical world -- we have gold, silver, platinum, etc., but each is somewhat different from the others, and there's a finite number of metals that can reasonably be used.

[note 1] I do not mean that a given ASIC would have to be maximally efficient for each algorithm within a class, only that there could exist an ASIC that would be much more efficient for every algorithm within a class than a GPU or similar general-purpose hardware

[note 2] No one would use sodium or potassium as a store of value because of their reactivity

[note 3] I previously had a discussion on this topic [here]( https://np.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/7psibt/confused_about_digital_scarcity/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)

[note 4] Pure proof of stake should be even worse, because there is no way to prevent a direct copy&amp;paste of the code and/or the addresses and balances. Therefore, in proof of stake, the network effect should be even more important ","false","8mw3qe",NA,0,NA,"false",1529784735,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","WARNING",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/8mw3qe/is_there_a_finite_number_of_classes_of_pow/","t3_8mw3qe",NA,NA,"WARNING","",0,0

I am curious if you fine people could help me understand the concept of Hashgraph.  Or more specifically, I am interested in the technology surrounding these consensus algorithms being described as ""post blockchain"".  I'm comfortable reading white papers, what I am more curious about are the other projects in the space with similar ideas.

From my understanding, Hashgraph is consensus protocol where each node maintains their own blockchain.  Each node then gossips \(protocol\) about their blockchain and records the gossip they hear on said blockchain.  They then gossip again and now we have a ""gossip about gossip"" message send in the gossip protocol stored on a node specific blockchain.  There is also some business about witnesses, but honestly this is not what I'm curious about.

What I am more interested in are other projects that may overlap in consensus protocol with Hashgraph.  Are there projects where each node has its own blockchain?  How about protocols that also implement gossip?  Any project you know of that overlaps on the protocol level would be very interesting to know about.

Thanks so much for the guidance.  Learning together is the bomb.","false","8n2k9c",NA,0,NA,"false",1529787883,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/8n2k9c/hashgraph/","t3_8n2k9c",NA,NA,"","",0,0

I don't think I've ever seen a usage that made sense for blockchain tech.  

When you control the hashpower, the nodes, and the software, haven't you given up the main value propositions of blockchain tech?  Those being decentralization, immutability, censorship resistance, and trustlessness?  

There is an amount of gained redundancy, but all of this can be done with proper database setups.  

In looking this up, Andreas Antonopolis seems to have a similar view:

&gt;The banks and the corporations say, “Oh, bitcoin’s awesome. We want that. Only without the open, decentralized, peer-to-peer, borderless, permissionless part. Could we instead have a closed, controlled, tame, identity-laden permission version of that please?


Is there something I'm missing?

Not a blockchain that uses liquid democracy for the node representatives. 

Liquid democracy is a democratic system where you delegate your vote to someone (much like a representative system) then you can also vote on an issue yourself and take away that delegation for that vote. You can do this for every vote or only vote on issues that you care/know about. The rest of the time is your delegate voting for you. You can change delegates at anytime and you can delegate your vote to anyone. More info [here.](https://medium.com/organizer-sandbox/liquid-democracy-true-democracy-for-the-21st-century-7c66f5e53b6f)

I'm trying to jumpstart a project that uses blockchain to make this come true. We would have a party of candidates and (hopefully) elect then into legislation. We would vote and delegate on each issue and the legislator would have to follow the majority vote. Votes would be verified on the blockchain and we would know what the total was. Thus we can say that the legislator voted against us with untampered evidence. 

We are still in the idea phase. We haven't decided on how to fund the development of the project or on the platform to use (we are considering wanchain and possibly enigma when is launches). 

There are of course things that will need to be resolved like how we would punish legislators to follow the majority and how to resolve the cost of running the smart contract, but solutions can be found.

EDIT: Thanks guys, for anyone wondering the answer to my question is that the mobile mining isn't actual mining. It's more of a slow airdrop type scenario which doesn't actually affect the blockchain in any way. I believe this means the system can't be gamed in order to do a 51% attack or something like that.

Imagine that you are a freelance industrial designer by trade and have just finished developing a new product. Assume that you already have a means of manufacturing and distributing the product.

You have a background in graphic design, but only very basic knowledge of CSS coding. You want to set up an e-commerce website so that you can promote and sell your startup product, but you also want to be able to accept cryptocurrencies (assume any big players for now such as BTC, ETH, XMR) as a form of payment in order to cater to a wider audience and prepare for the [inevitable] future of social finance. 

How would you go about implementing a crypto payment system into a build-your-own-website (assuming that you can use any website builder of your choosing such as Wix, Squarespace, Shopify, WordPress etc.) and how would it function?

Is it possible to set up a system that creates an invoice for the customer and the owner (you) simultaneously?","false","8g622s",NA,0,NA,"false",1529663661,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","DEVELOPMENT",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/8g622s/question_regarding_implementing_a_crypto_payment/","t3_8g622s",NA,NA,"DEVELOPMENT","",0,0

https://crypsys.mmci.uni-saarland.de/projects/CoinShuffle/coinshuffle.pdf

Basically suggests that using a diffie hellman type protocol not necessarily ECDH can provide anonymity by changing outputs from one transaction to another to provide inputs for another, this is all encrypted, so the change of outputs is not seen. this is done a few times in a circular manner e.g. alice encrypts bobs outputs then charlie does the same thing, its unraveled in the reverse order and done again. I might be a bit off on the underlying protocol with my explanation, as i didnt have enough time to read the paper. its a dense read.

The protocol reminded me of RingCT in monero i.e. using different outputs from other transactions but its not the same. has a muhc lower byte size payload for one and in general the protocol is different.

If this could be incorporated into btc, i wonder if its side chained or anchored onto btc? Because having outputs -&gt; inputs on transactions in the ledger this is not obfuscated is how the ledger works. 

I forgot to mention that at the end of the protocol the coins end up at a brand new address, which would make using it in the first place unuser friendly, and as someone else mentioned in this post, would require many participant transactions for it to work to find outputs to match inputs, so realistically i think the coin shuffle algo would need to be enforced, not opt in, as people probably wouldnt opt in and many wallets wouldn't have the option. It's similar to monero in that regard with ring signatures. privacy in monero is enforced, so there is no trouble finding outputs to create the new transaction. Perhaps if this protocol was enforced on BTC then it could work, but given the resistance to change by the btc dev community, i don't think it will come about anytime soon if this protocol has merit.

what do you guys think? does this paper hold merit?","false","8jybs4",NA,0,NA,"false",1529732023,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","DEVELOPMENT",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/8jybs4/coinshuffle_paper_a_way_to_provide_anonymity_on/","t3_8jybs4",NA,NA,"DEVELOPMENT","",0,0

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Something that I find conceptually strange in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, litecoin, and decred, is that every transaction is treated equally, no matter what its value. The basic reason for this makes sense \-\- it doesn't take up any more space on the blockchain to list a big transaction vs a tiny transaction \-\- but it results in issues where big expensive chains with the strongest security \(bitcoin\) become unusable for small transactions because of fees.

Naively, the security of the network is related to its market cap \(for proof of work, this is related to the total cost of specialized mining equipment, etc.\).

So, putting these thoughts together, it makes sense that one would want to use a chain with a lower market cap for smaller transactions, since they can be done cheaper, and the security considerations are smaller. Conversely, if you want to send $100 million, you don't care about the fees, and you want maximum security. All of this is already playing out, with bitcoin used for large transactions and others \(e.g. litecoin\) being used for smaller ones.

This issue seems to be addressed/addressable using atomic swaps. One could use decred, litecoin, or other ""smaller cap"" currencies for small transactions, and atomic swap to bitcoin for long\-term storage of larger amounts. However, currently such a system is rather ad hoc \-\- it relies on having atomic\-swap\-compatible chains with a nice sequence of market caps.

I wonder if it would make sense to directly launch a sequence of individual blockchains that are roughly the same and can easily interact with atomic swaps, but have slightly different consensus algorithms \(e.g., the proof\-of\-work functions would be slightly incompatible\) and decreasing block times. It might be possible to come up with an equilibrium where, e.g., there are three chains: Decred\-main \(5 min blocks\), Decred\-sub1 \(1 min blocks\), Decred\-sub2 \(30 sec blocks\). Small cheap transactions could live on Decred\-sub2, aggregated into bigger transactions \+ medium\-term storage on Decred\-sub1, and then ultimately settled on Decred\-main.

Is this a reasonable approach to scaling?","false","8gn0kt",NA,0,NA,"false",1529671973,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/8gn0kt/effective_scaling_of_the_level_of_security_and/","t3_8gn0kt",NA,NA,"","",0,0

&gt; Scalability — a high number of transactions per second.

&gt; Decentralization — a large number of actors participating in block production and validation process.

&gt; Security — making it expensive to gain majority control over the network

It goes into why EOS has the 21 Block Producers solution. I know other crypto projects have had this sort of idea too. Like NEO for instance is currently centralized though they plan not to be in the future. You see a lot of projects with scalability claims, but many don't really go into high detail.

My question though is high scalability currently been shown possible on blockchain without centralization, sharding, off-chain scaling etc.? Or do most of these platforms with claims have some other simliar hinderance that lands them in the same trilemma?

Binance was no.1 exchange by volume, now a close 2nd by volume with fiat pairs and DEX incoming, perhaps they’ll make both more mainstream and accessible to normies compared to other fiat pair exchanges and DEX?

BNB has %50 reduced fee on first year for trading, withdrawing and listing coins, will be used as gas for DEX, perhaps its like owning an assets within Binance (correct me on this one), while it’s still ERC20, I believe they’ll have their own unique platform once they release DEX (meaning that BNB is upgraded).

It is hosted as a google doc for ease of use for both editors and viewers.  

We've all seen the comparison charts floating around crypto and I'm sure noticed the rampant bias.  These charts are created to promote the coin that made them and oftentimes are significantly misleading if not downright inaccurate.  When you cherrypick the categories you can make anything seem better or worse [like this](https://i.imgur.com/fV9vcFY.jpg)

Thank you to all the contributors.  I hope this can help normalize some of the comparisons and provide an easy reference for data that was surprisingly hard to find it a lot of cases.  

You can view the chart here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-weHt0PiIZWyXs1Uzp7QIUKk9TX7aa15RtFc8JJpn7g/edit?usp=sharing

and it can be discussed here: /r/PrivacyCoinMatrix

##FAQ:

1. How does this project maintain objectivity?

 Data is reviewed by the community and people in good standing with most coins.  It also avoids subjective or ambiguous entries like ""Privacy Level: Medium"".  

2. What are the requirements for this chart? 

 The definition of ""privacy coin"" is subjective, so the current requirements are having any privacy features beyond what bitcoin has.  

3. How should this data be used?

 That is up to the reader, but some uses for this data are learning about new coins, finding red flags, or hopefully as an easily available and credible source for data.  Maybe the data shows the true leaders in crypto privacy or shows that a coin is not as private as you were led to believe.  Maybe you just love spreadsheets 

5. Does inclusion in this chart constitute an endorsement of the coin?

 No, it is an endorsement of doing your own research.  My personal definition of 'privacy coin' does not include multiple coins on this chart.

6. Can I donate?  

 Yes:  https://supporters.eff.org/donate

I could just set up loads of nodes and slow down certain transactions from reaching mining/economic nodes. Is there any solution to this?","Consider the below. These are not my thoughts, I just find them very interesting and would welcome your opinions. 

~

All blockchain networks use something called a gossip network to communicate - it is just as it sounds, you receive a message and then proceed to tell everyone you are connected to that message until you are told to stop. The reason we need to use this is because any other system can be interfered with if there are privileged parties distributing messages. 

One problem:
Say I receive a transaction in that I want to slow down. I can refuse to propagate it and slow its delivery to miners. I don't need to be mining to do this - I just need to be a full node. 

So think about it - the way that sybil resistance is managed in proof of work is through mining, but you can circumvent the consensus mechanism entirely by just flooding the network with nodes and not propagating either transactions or blocks you don't like, slowing them down and in some cases enabling things like double spends to occur.

Additionally, a bunch of nodes distributed through a network by a mining company could be used to slow down a block created by a competitor in the case where they came up with a block at roughly the same time. This is an occurrence that happens more often than you would think.

Another problem:
Bitpay, coin base, etc. have direct connections with mining pools, and genesis mining, and send them transactions directly. This way transactions get published quickly and miners are always sure they receive blocks quickly so they can get onto the next one without waiting for the block to travers a *quite shoddy* gossip network. 

Their connections are points of censorship, so if genesis and the pools got together and decided to close their connections to bitpay because coinbase made a deal with them, Bitpay transactions would have to take the long way around while coinbase would get the highway, meaning faster confirmations. 

This sounds mild, but over time, as these highways become more entrenched we are seeing a decay to centralisation of the layer below mining, and it could ultimately lead to an entirely private network infrastructure.

How big of an issue is that?","I was having a discussion on the fact that Nano doesn't have an incentive system to run nodes, which imho is a real problem to achieve actual decentralization.

See the [discussion thread here](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/8lpd9b/does_anyone_here_realize_how_big_the_nano/dzhmyz2/) 

During the discussion I was asked to show a  scenario in which this could be a problem, and I realized that it was actually under our eyes: 55% of voting power is currently held by ""official representatives"": https://nano.org/en/explore/representatives 

On the discussion on the nano sub, everyone seems to shrug it off as a non-issue (no surprises here), saying that the devs will fix it soon (I've been hearing that for 6 months), etc.  

So I wanted to get more ""objective"" discussion about it, that's why I'm writing here.  What do you guys think?  From my point of view this is a big issue, as the devs could decide to that whatever they want with the network (allow double spends, etc). Or am I wrong?

Has there been much adoption?","I was thinking about decentralised applications and realistically their potential for adoption by businesses, even just smart contracts to perform something basic i.e. not a feature rich application doing complex operations requiring data storage, lots of calculations or lots of messages e.g. dapp facebook

Ethereum has been around for a while, most of the dApps out are not being used by businesses, its mostly exchanges, games, gambling  market places. https://dappradar.com/dapps?search=&amp;sortBy=volumeLastWeek&amp;order=desc&amp;tab=allDapps 

for dApps to be successful, i think a big part of that has to come from the enterprise level. creaitng apps because they want to use the merits of blockchain, this will provie the adoption and further price increases more os than genal consumers, just my opinion. 

for companies ot what to use decentralisated apps. you only want to use decentralisation if you dont trust a centralised authority otherwise its just easier to do it centralised. there are different useful scenarios for blockchain like a currency no centralised authority has control over, but thats not what im talking about here. 

are there any organisations that are using dapps now? i hear plans of companies intending to do so, u hear partnerships etc with smart contract coins that arn't working produts yet.

apart form annoncements of other dApp platforms. if companies do adopt dapps, it raises questions, what kind? they might go for a permissioned blockchain (private) giving them performance benefits over a permissionless (public) blockchain. if its private, it means we dont get any tokens to make moeny off.

there is good use case for consumer dapps, for example, any social media where they harvest my data i consider it a good candidate for decentralisation, i consider facebook and google bad actors. they know so much aobut us. if i could use a decentralised facebook. i would in a heart beat. 

you also have interesting scenarios like oyster shell and skycoin which offer a secondary internet which is outside of control of centralised authority utilising dApp. these offer an internet which does not require an internet service provider. the internet is provided by a meshnet, normal websites could be provided. how this is to be provided efficiently especially with oyster shl isn't realistically going to happen anytime oson. skycoin i havent looked into enough.

what are your thoughts on adoption of dapps? do you think the adoption is important ot justify the market cap of these dApps? many dapp coins are valued more than large enterprises that have good financials.
 
edit - as an addition, what do you think of vechain using a cenralized / decentralised approach. they use proof of authority, have a council of elected members. its not clear what the token holders get and what hte purpose of the token represents. they try to disconnect the usage / creation of its protocol with price of the token i.e. its not reliant on its price of the token to operate cheaply",NA,"8v0pys",NA,0,NA,"false",1536464209,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/8v0pys/adoption_of_decentralisation_applications_by/",NA,"Enthusiast","false","","",0,0

The centralized approach these companies apply to their apps and services create silos that result in fragmented user experiences. Often, users have to manage different accounts and subscriptions just to have access to the functionalities they need. Interoperability and integration across these applications are often lacking as well.

What Cardstack essentially offers is a decentralized application orchestration platform. It allows users to create customized workflows by linking various app functionalities and services together.

While the concept is similar to orchestration services like IFTTT, Cardstack is able to tap into almost any data source including blockchain allowing users to accommodate the new technology into their workflows.

Instead of having companies dictate how a particular service should work, users are given the flexibility to create their own experiences. Functionalities like authentication, chat, collaboration, and payments are visualized as cards which users can stack together based on the conditions and rules they set.
For this to work, Cardstack is envisioned to be a complete ecosystem featuring the following components:

**Cardstack Hub.** The Cardstack Hub facilitates the orchestration functionalities. It sits at the layer between data sources and the user experience and is responsible for sending out commands and listening for changes from local, cloud, or blockchain data sources.

**Cardstack Framework.** A comprehensive standard development kit (SDK) is made available to developers allowing them to create their own decentralized applications (dApps). Various functionalities and features are to be developed based on open-source standards. This way, users and developers will be able to replicate and modify them to generate new and improved functionalities.

**Cardstack Token (CARD).** Fueling Cardstack’s economy is its Ethereum-based ERC20 CARD Token. Aside from working as a typical cryptocurrency, it’s also used to drive the ecosystem. Users need to pay CARD in order to create smart contracts to tap into their chosen apps. These payments are then staked into a reward pool that will then be used to incentivize and compensate the open-source developers contributing to the platform.

**Reward Pool.** Instead of direct payouts, the system uses a decentralized payment algorithm and a governance model to determine how much contributors are to be paid. Users can also earn CARD tokens by participating in analytic mining. Unlike mining in the traditional sense where users have to solve cryptographic puzzles, Cardstack analytic miners help calculate the platform’s reward function instead.

**Tally Protocol.** Driving all these is Cardstack’s own Tally consensus protocol. Earlier consensus protocols like Bitcoin’s uses the resource-hungry and slow proof-of-work protocol. This has resulted in high transaction costs. It also needed immense amounts of computing power to perform. In contrast, Tally is built to be scalable. It uses proof-of-usage messages that are handled off-chain before the final payment is sent back to an on-chain smart contract. This effectively reduces much of the load that the blockchain would have handled instead resulting in better efficiency.",NA,"8v3eaw",NA,0,NA,"false",1536465470,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/8v3eaw/giving_users_the_flexibility_to_create_and/",NA,"CT: 4 karma CC: 560 karma BC: 291 karma","false","","",0,0

You can try the dApp out here:  
https://sj.bankex.com/

To vote, you need to get vote tokens which are available for free (minus gas/txn charges) by clicking on the get tokens button. Once the tokens show up on the dApp, you can vote on open issues. 

I think it needs a bit of work, but I think its a wonderful concept if you can somehow tie this dApp's process to escrow or disputes on marketplaces like ebay, etc. It would help in resolving a number of disputes. The current iteration leaves scope for being gamed, but I think the framework and concept behind the product is pretty good.

I read the [whitepaper](https://storage.googleapis.com/bridge-assets/bridge-protocol-whitepaper-1_0.pdf) and a few ICO reviews, but I'm not sure if I understood correctly *how* exactly the individual and ICO exchange the KYC information of the former (the whitepaper in particular is too vague for me). I'd like to ask you if my understanding (which I'll write below) of Bridge Protocol's identity verification and exchange mechanism is correct:    
1) the customer builds his/her own identity dossier by uploading documents through the [Bridge Protocol app](https://neonewstoday.com/general/bridge-protocol-releases-mobile-app-design-preview/) to a wallet with a certain private key / public address pair; said documents will be stored and managed by Bridge Protocol in their private blockchain (which I seem to understand is simply a decentralized company-owned database of sorts and not a smart contract on the NEO blockchain that is simply not publicly accessible);    
2) the uploaded documents are verified according to the current AML/KYC protocols by a trusted third party consisting of attorneys and legal offices appointed by Bridge Protocol;    
3) since an ICO needs to perform KYC on its prospective investors in order to whitelist them, instead of asking the individual for his/her documents it simply asks for his/her public address and checks whether the third party has confirmed the documents tied to such address are legit, without actually ever seeing these documents;    
4) if the documents passed the vetting, the ICO will be given assurance [from the private blockchain?] that the investor is ""clean"";    
5) at this point the ICO sends the investor a legally binding contract which the investor has to sign with their private key;    
6) the investor and the ICO may now proceed with the exchange of tokens for NEO/USD/EUR/etc.    

So... Is my understanding correct? Or does Bridge Protocol work in a different way?

It is a 650 person crabbers island in the Chesapeake.   They are struggling I believe from onslaught of foreign crabs, sourced with cheap labor.   There are two things crypto related I believe could help them.

A.  Sellers cooperative,  like Ocean Spray,   B.   Direct consumer sale via crypto &amp; internet of,  Steamed whole crab,  Jumbo lump, lump, and backfin  picked crab meat,     

It could basically be Cryptocrabs \- Via website it could be shown when pots are set,  and when boat will be going out to harvest the traps.   The goal would be to have the crab sold before heading to pull the pots.    With this knowledge,  when boat returns to port, processing for order fulfillment would begin immediately.     I believe direct sale of crab to individiuls not as close to fishery could result in higher margin sales.     Excess harvest could be sold through arrangements with companies like Whole Foods.

I plan on researching how Ocean Spray, and other producer seller markets function,   I would like to work towards building a framework to help the people of Tangier make a better living on the bay without pressure to increase harvest and pressure on crab populations.      Coins like RVN already have the ability to form securities,   If an operational model was created I believe this company could be created and function.   I have commercial fishing experience, and employment history with Whole Foods.  I am presently a hospital nurse,  the technical aspects of implementing something like this is outside my wheelhouse.

It all sounds interesting on paper, the team is large and Ontology itself is a product of Onchain, meaning there's Da Hongfei behind it and as far as I know he's a respected pioneer of blockchain technology.
Despite all this and many news outlets describing Ontology as a promising project, I fail to understand *who* (as in: which companies - some examples would be very much appreciated -, since Ontology seems to be heavily geared towards corporate customers) might actually be in need of a decentralized trust network for identity verification and management and be ready to pay for it and *what* purpose would a dossier of sorts on a company or individual serve in such a network. In other words, and reconnecting to the title, is there an *actual* market for Ontology? If yes, which kinds of companies, and why would they prefer a distributed approach?

I was pleasantly surprised to see Apple introducing a host of new privacy features into Safari this year. Of all the major tech companies, I think Apple takes privacy most seriously, for two reasons. 1) They really believe in it 2) They can afford to, because of their business model! This alignment of incentives and values seems pretty powerful.

Reflecting on this further, I realized the same incentives and values would make Apple a candidate to push decentralized tech forward as well. They also own the right parts of the tech stack to do so. I wrote up my thoughts in greater here:

So I think I've had a new idea: Proof of Collision. It is in a way, the opposite of a bitcoin transaction, as it doesn't use hash functions as a one-way authentication proof, it requires there to be a collision in the hash function PoC uses, a hash function I'm sure y'all heard of called SHA-1.

In a PoC setup, miners would listen for a new pending transaction. Each transaction would store the sender's SHA-3 public key, the receiver's SHA-3 public key, the amount sent,  the transaction weight, the SHA-3 hash of the transaction, and **the Stake Address**. The Stake Address is a special SHA-1 ""wallet"" public key that is verified to have a collision. Why you ask? We'll get to it later... ;)

Miners verify the transaction by searching the blockchain for validity, and proof of funds. If the miner approves it, they stake .05% of the coins sent in that transaction to the Stake Address as **proof** they are sure the transaction is valid.

Transactions and Blocks work a bit differently in this system. Exactly after a new block is sumbitted, a queue for a new block is submitted. Each pending transaction is put into the queue. Then, when a predefined number of transactions is made, the block is submitted. That predefined number is equal to: 

&gt; Approval ÷ Speed

where approval time is the time it took from the block being submitted to the block being verified completely with 3 verifications, and speed being the time it took from the queue being created to the block being sumbitted. At the genesis block, the block verification time is 10 minutes.

Remember when I talked about the Stake Address having verified collisions? Well if the transaction gets more than 5 confirmations, it is queued for addition in the next block. When 10 transactions have been queued for the next block, the miners that submitted coins the Stake Addresses of at least one transaction try to ""Collision Mine"" their Stake Addresses, basically sending a collision attack at the address. This does two things: eliminates block times to scale to the speed of transactions, Whoever finds the collision first gets all of the coins used to confirm the transaction. The transaction is then added to the blockchain. On the OTHER HAND, if the transaction turns out to be false, the miner simply does not get their coins back. 

So you may be thinking, finding SHA-1 collisions is very tedious, and requires a lot of power. As /u/quertyasdf12345 puts it:

&gt;&gt; A collision can be computed in advance and has a fixed computational cost. Scaling this for mining power seems dubious. Even if your system proposes a way around those problems, it seems that it's just an elaborate scheme that still relies on computational effort, and is therefore another name for proof of work. The ~2^63 calls to sha1 that the shattered research made required 6500 CPU years and 100 GPU years. That is a substantial amount of effort, and is only valid for a very specific type of collision. If that's required for every block, the block reward + fees would have to be hundreds of thousands of dollars just to break even.

He is not wrong in regards to what he is talking about; that being brute force SHA-1 attacks. His description would be an accurate representation of **brute force attacks**, but thanks to engineers at Google, there is a calculated way to create collisions and detect them. [This Website](https://shattered.io/#) and [This Git Repo](https://github.com/cr-marcstevens/sha1collisiondetection) document how to calculate AND create SHA\-1 Collisions, using PDF's as an example of how this works. This would still be tedious to an extent, but not as much so as the proof of work algorithm.

So you might be wondering, what does all of this mean? It means scalability on the blockchain transactions, fee-free payments, and (unintentionally) depracating SHA-1 further so people will make the switch to SHA-256 or SHA-3.

Thanks for actually reading this post to the end; hell, I couldn't during editing. And if you didn't read it all the way though, fuck you!

Zerocoin works a bit differently than other crypto privacy protocols, so let’s break it down. This article is written from a PIVX perspective, but others like ZCoin, Zoin, and more use the same technology but custom terminology.  First, the two types of tokens:

Piv are the normal token on the blockchain.  zPIV  are the private PIVX token.  Most other coins call these zerocoins

Are piv and zPIV different?  Yes and no. You can think of zPIV like the private version of a piv. 1 zPIV will always equal 1 piv in value. There is no second blockchain or anything like that.


####Step 1 — The Mint
The mint is done before you want to spend your coins privately, as will be explained in step 2. When you mint your coins, you are sending them to an “accumulator” where nobody will ever be able to spend them. In blockchain terms, this is called “burning” coins, but why would you want to burn your coins?

You complete this burn in exchange for an IOU from the network, which is called zPIV. If you burned 10piv, you get 10 zPIV. The IOU means the network allows you to redeem your 10 zPIV later in step 3 for 10 fresh piv.  [This is what a mint looks like on the block explorer.](http://www.presstab.pw/phpexplorer/PIVX/tx.php?tx=4bd041ad764930cc63fe07aec7961e075e80b35f35a073bc15c16dbe18d0310b)

####Step 2 — Time Passes
In the Zerocoin protocol there is an enforced gap in time between the mint and the spend. If the mint and spend happened at the same time, you would only be mixing your coins with anyone else currently mixing (perhaps nobody). The gap in minting and spending means your coins are mixed with all other coins that have ever been minted to that denomination

####Step 3 — The Spend
At some point in the future, you probably want to spend your private coins. You can now spend some of your zPIV to any address just like you would spend normal piv, and they will appear in the destination address as newly generated piv with no history or connection to you.  [This is what a spend looks like on the block explorer.](http://www.presstab.pw/phpexplorer/PIVX/tx.php?tx=ab6230b448f2247d2768049817005740dd80e39d0deaa9097d31ff1aff32e6d4)

You may have heard of Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) and this is where that comes in. ZKP basically means demonstrating you know something without revealing what it is. In this case, you are demonstrating that you minted the coins you’re spending without revealing which coins they trace back to.

####Recent Improvements to Zerocoin

#####zPoS
In May 2018, PIVX released zPoS (Zerocoin Proof of Stake) which is the only private staking system in crypto. It incentivizes the use of privacy and helped PIVX attain the highest percentage of private supply of any ZK privacy-based coin.  [This is what a zPoS reward looks like on the block explorer.](http://www.presstab.pw/phpexplorer/PIVX/tx.php?tx=30117e908d0d6af3654e63673db611911f62a8c6f0fb950db8974e174d4a8bee)

#####dzPIV
Those zPIV you got in Step 1 are saved in your local wallet.dat, completely off the blockchain, how’s that for privacy? In most Zerocoin systems, this means you need to make new backups of your wallet.dat after every mint, which is a huge hassle and easy to screw up. PIVX is not most Zerocoin implementations. PIVX is the only coin to offer one-time seed backups with a feature called dzPIV (deterministic zPIV)

#####ezPIV
You encrypted your wallet.dat file like you were supposed to right? You might be surprised to learn most Zerocoin coins do not protect your zPIV with this encryption, so anyone who can get a hold of your wallet.dat file can get your zerocoins even if the wallet.dat is encrypted. PIVX is the only coin to encrypt your zPIV and protect them with it’s ezPIV feature (encrypted zPIV)

#####Automint
There’s only 3 steps in the process, but PIVX takes care of the first of the first 2 automatically for you. The PIVX automint will automatically mint 10% of your piv to zPIV. This percentage is configurable from 0 to 100, but it’s a nice way to make sure you’ve always got private coins ready to spend

#####The Smallest Spend Sizes
A drawback to many privacy mechanisms is large transaction sizes, with Zerocoin being the largest at 25kb. Compared to Bitcoin’s ~266 bytes per transactions this is quite large. PIVX launched their Zerocoin protocol with 20% smaller spend sizes, which means less blockchain bloat, lower fees, and shorter sync time. Author of Bulletproof technology Jonathan Bootle has joined the PIVX team and expects to be able to reduce this another 90% to around 1kb

#####Fractional Spends
It was not previously possible to spend part of a zerocoin, but starting in August 2017, PIVX allows you to spend zPIV and get your change back

#####Spending to 3rd Parties
The original Zerocoin protocol had you spend your zerocoins back to your own wallet before sending them to the destination. When PIVX launched Zerocoin in August, 2017, it allowed spends directly to any destination address for the first time. ZCoin also has this capability as of June 3rd, 2018

**Here is a new blockchain consensus algorithm,** [**PoR ( Proof of Relevance )**](https://github.com/ninanoo/PoR)**.**

As yet a theoretical algorithm, I hope this algorithm will be discussed and improved with the people who study and develop the blockchain.

As a mathematically provable algorithm based on computational complexity theory, The algorithm requires someone who handles probability theory well.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is a brief introduction to PoR.

I'm sorry that it is a bit hard to read because I am not used to writing English.   
\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

**Blockchain Consensus Algorithm determined by Relevance**

PoR is a blockchain consensus algorithm that the next block is determined by relevance. The relevance is obtained from the proprietary information of each block between adjacent blocks. The relevance can also be created from the work of PoW or the stake of PoS. In this document, the asymmetric key pair of each block used to generate the signature is also used as the proprietary information.

It uses a hash chain of Bitcoin, but has a dual chain structure such as Bitcoin-NG. There are a key block chain and an authentication block chain linked each other. In the key block chain, a candidate that can generate an authentication through consensus is registered. In the authentication block chain, the authentication for a ledger is registered. With the use of a dual chain, the registered candidate can generate a real authentication after a very long time and there is also competition at that time.

Relevance is used for competition to be registered as a candidate to generate an authentication. Reverse relevance is used for competition to create real authentication. Both competing situations are competition for time based on relevance and they are all for personal benefit. This prevents problems such as 'nothing at stake'.

It is not the computational complexity that simply solves the hash, but there are numerical parts related to the operation of the algorithm such as many candidate blocks or very large threshold value, and they are all designed based on computational complexity theory. As a result, all attacks on the algorithm are probabilistically impossible.

Due to the use of the dual chain with attributes such as relevance, reverse relevance, and the threshold value for generating authentication block, the authentication for the ledger operates deterministically. Attacks such as double spending or finney attack do not occur because authentication to the ledger is deterministic.

Due to the use of proprietary information, it is more resistant than bitcoin against 51&amp;#37; attack and localization problems. High-speed processing is possible enough to generate each authentication block for the unit ledgers without the use of merkle tree depending on the size of the network. There may be one reward for the participation of a majority of legitimate users, but there are no rewards for the functional behavior of the algorithm.",NA,"8us8b1",NA,0,NA,"false",1536460212,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/8us8b1/por_proof_of_relevance_a_new_blockchain_consensus/",NA,"2 months old | Karma CT: 13","false","","",0,0

I just released a blockchain technology, its unique in so many ways.

\- It solves the scale problem with three unique solutions

* Public keys registration, any new public key is added to the blockchain database, so next time someone is using it, it replaced with a numeric value of 1-4 bytes only. While Bitcoin can store around 2K transactions in one-megabyte block, Coco can have about 100k!
* Coco use a Royal Network, only pools who mined a block can become a peer in the network, it makes the network size very small and allows everyone to be connected to each other all the time. With coco, you can have over a Gigabyte block size
* Finally, coco offer off chain transactions in the form of D.T.P read about it on the website.

\- More advanced smart contracts then Etherume. With coco, you can trigger smart contracts by incoming transactions and by time, like Cron jobs in Linux.

It's written in pure Java. The wallet use JavaFX

1. Purely stake based, no external resource consumption
2. Achieves finality in 1 block (assuming nodes utilize incentive to operate in cloud)
3. Defends against History (Costless Simulation) Attacks with nearly the entire stake
4. Does not suffer from Nothing-at-Stake for Stake-Bleeding Attack

I recommend reading should start at Section 2.1 Overview and Section 2.2 Protocol.

TL;DR It is being discussed in [Bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/) at [https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3913439.0](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3913439.0)

A: The contract runner is an add-on, a server-side extension, which every node can decide to run or not. When it’s running, it loads the contract stored in the blockchain and executes it based on various conditions.

Q: How can I choose to execute a contract on my node?

A: You should configure the contract runner add-on in nxt.properties and the contracts.json configuration file. Any node owner can choose if and how to configure the contract settings. For example, each node will probably use different account passphrase to sign the transactions submitted by the contract and may provide the contract different setup parameters.

Q: Can Nodes, running the contract runner add-on, choose which contracts to execute or will they execute any contract?

A: Either the node owner should list the contracts the node supports in the contracts configuration file or set a flag which enables the node to execute any contract.

Q: What triggers contract execution?

A: Contracts are triggered either by sending them a transaction with a specific “trigger” message or with each new block.

Q: What is the contract id?

A: Each contract has a unique ID composed of the chain and full hash of the cloud data transaction in which they are stored.

Q: How does the contract runner select contracts to execute?

A: Three options:

1. For transaction-based contracts, it scans every new transaction for an attached trigger message which specifies the chain and full hash of the contract. If it finds such a message, it invokes the contract to which it points, passing any optional parameters embedded in the message.

2. For block-based contracts, the node keeps a list of supported contracts and executes each one of them whenever it receives a new block.

3. Contracts can be invoked by the user using the invokeContract API which mimics the operation of 1 and 2. This API requires the admin password.

Q: If more than one node execute the same contract, what is the mechanism to avoid repeat output transactions?

A: There is nothing preventing more than one node from executing the same contract. In fact, this can be useful in many cases, and in most cases each of these nodes will use its own account passphrase to sign transactions generated by the contract. Node operators should make sure that they run their contract only on one node and that this node is always running, to avoid sending duplicate transactions from the contract, or to avoid not running the contract at all.

Q: How would account control increase the security of the contract?

A: When the contract account is under account control, a transaction submitted by a contract will trigger an automatic approval process on another node which controls the account. The other node will repeat the same calculation and compare its results with the transaction submitted by the contract. If there is a match, it will submit an approval transaction for the transaction submitted by the contract. Of course, this process can also be done manually.

Q: How can I review and validate the contract code?

A: If the source code is published, compile it and make sure you generate the exact same class file stored in the blockchain. If the source code is not published, download the class file from the blockchain and decompile it using any standard Java IDE to review the code.

Q: Do you have to upload the binary .class file or can you upload a .java source file?

A: Currently you need to upload the .class file. In theory, you can also upload .java source code and the node will compile it into a .class file before running the contract, but this requires the nodes to run a Java JDK instead of JRE and this has more potential problems and attack vectors so it’s not supported at the moment.

Q: Can a contract submit multi-signature transaction (a.k.a phased transactions)?

A: Transactions submitted by a contract are normal transactions. A contract can be designed to submit only phased transactions, however this is up to the contract developer to decide. If the contract account is under account control then all transactions submitted by the contract are phased by default.

Q: Can several nodes run the same contract?

A: Sure, as long as each node uses a different account passphrase to sign transactions this can be useful. For example, an Oracle contract which records shipping costs or exchange rates on the blockchain can be deployed once and used by multiple nodes to record shipping costs between different locations, or exchange rates between different currency pairs, or different information providers. Most contracts will check some condition before they submit a transaction. For example, the RandomPayment contract verifies that the trigger transaction has sent an amount to its own account before sending back the random payment. Therefore, if it is deployed on 5 different nodes with 5 different accounts, then each of these nodes will respond to funds sent to a different account.

Q: So the contract is executed only by the account to which the trigger message is sent or by all nodes running the contract runner?

A: Potentially by all nodes. There can be contracts that execute without any trigger message, for example, an Oracle service which checks the weather at some location every hour and records it in an account property, but someone will have to cover the transaction fees to update the account property in this case. As long as it makes sense for a service to run a contract and submit transactions they can deploy a contract triggered by every block or a contract triggered by a message transaction (or a message attached to any transaction type) sent to any account, not necessarily to their own account. For example, if the message is sent to an account with a certain property set by the contract account then the contact will execute its logic, otherwise it will ignore the message.

Q: What forces the contract “owner” to execute the contract?

A: Nothing, in fact, one weakness of this approach is that you may send an amount to the contract account but the contract account owner may never execute the triggered contract to provide you the service and just lock this amount. Therefore this mechanism requires some trust in the contract runner node. Of course, you can define that the funds are sent to an escrow account and only released to the contract account after it does some work, but then you need to trust the escrow account and develop a procedure to move funds from the escrow account to the contract account.

Q: Can you lock funds for a timeout period to cancel the trigger transaction so the funds go back to the sender?

A: You can use any feature already available on Ardor to set these conditions. Right now we do not provide transactions submitted by contracts any additional privileges or set any special restrictions on them.",NA,"8ugktt",NA,0,NA,"false",1536454732,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/8ugktt/lightweight_contracts_faq/",NA,"Positive | CT: 13 karma","false","","",0,0

Can anyone think of a good reason why they went with blockchain?","https://www.asx.com.au/services/chess-replacement.htm

https://www.afr.com/technology/asx-blockchain-to-go-live-at-end-of-2020-20180427-h0zcgx

They are calling it distributed ledger technology (DLT) which is a private (permissioned) blockchain. Its a replacement of CHESS, the current centralised solution ASX uses which does the settlement and clearing of equities / financial instrument on the exchange plus other services.

The purpose of replacing CHESS: ""While fund managers, stockbrokers and custodians will be able to continue to operate in the same way they do now under the new system, if they ""take a node"" on the distributed ledger, this will let them see real-time data on equity ownership without them having to reconcile their own ledgers with ASX's. A year of testing will take place before the new system goes live.""

This blockchain solution is a private (permissioned) blockchain, this means that for people to read / write to it, must be granted authority. If you are not aware of permissioned blockchains and their pros / cons over public (permissionless) blockchains and centralised solutions i.e. databases, check out this paper, ""do you need a blockchain"" https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/375.pdf. Basically using blockchain is only useful if you want to provide a system where trust / consensus is decentralised usually because there is lack of trust between parties. otherwise a centralised solution is always superior in performance.

I'm wondering why they did this over using a centralised solution? can anyone think of a reason? Usually this is applicable in scenarios where parties in an industry don't nec trust each other so decentralisation makes sense. Supply chain management is a good usecase, its shown as an example of using a permissioned blockchain in the paper ""do you need a blockchain"" in the example they provide, the suppliers may want to track the quality of a good from supplier to supplier, hence the lack of trust of any one party providing the service of maintaining its authenticitiy. relegating it to a third party company is another option, but sometimes trust there is not sufficient e.g. they could be corrupt in the process or be not perform the service properly.

im wondering whats the usecase of permissioned blockchain for settlement of shares? they could provide the real time service with a centralised solution and just expose what they need to other parties via API calls. Using a permissioned blockcahin, what would the purpose of another party running a node even mean? The ASX and financial markets in Australia are highly regulated and thus auditable. Making the use of blockchain moot. So on the surface it seems like they are giving up all the advantages of having a centralised solution for no apparent reason. I'm sure they ahve their reasons, but i cant find any reasons why online or think of a good reason.

thoughts?

Decred is an open and progressive cryptocurrency with a system of community-based governance integrated into its blockchain. Decred’s major departure from Bitcoin’s protocol is through its implementation of a hybrid Proof-of-Work (PoW)/Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This hybrid approach is intended to distribute network influence more fairly between users (stakeholders) and miners.

I'd love to hear the communities thoughts on questions to ask and things to discuss.

Alex Hillman is the co-founder of IndyHall- one of the earliest, longest running, and most respected coworking communities in the world. He's also an entrepreneur, developer, speaker, prolific writer, podcast host, and all around expert in building community. Despite having his reservations around blockchain and cryptocurrencies, Alex is a self-described fan of decentralization.

I always pay attention when smart people like Alex are skeptical. Should be a great convo, and would love to hear what y'all would ask. Here's the link for the webinar if you're interested!

They've been in private beta testing for quite some time now and have just announced they'll be going to public beta testing in the middle of July. Here is a link to their announcement:

[https://medium.com/inside\-kin/the\-kinit\-app\-whats\-next\-aaf2dd6b8bce](https://medium.com/inside-kin/the-kinit-app-whats-next-aaf2dd6b8bce)

Disclaimer: Although I'm a holder of KIN tokens, I do not speak on their behalf or work for them. If you're interesting in knowing more, I've put together a little bit of information below that is, to the best of my knowledge, accurate. Please let me know if anything I've stated here is incorrect.

**BACKGROUND INFO:**

Kik is a messenger company with roughly 15...ish million active users and valued at a billion dollars. They did an ICO for KIN tokens last year and created the non\-profit Kin Foundation to manage them. Their intention was a multi\-purpose token that would be used for the following:

1: Including it in the Kik Messenger app. The users themselves could receive KIN coins from taking surveys, partaking in quizzes, answering questions, etc. Also, app content creators could be awarded coins from the KIN team. These coins will be spent on things ranging from simple e\-stickers, to gift cards which can be used in the real world, to who knows what else. The final integration of this would immediately give KIN coins the highest transaction volume of any coin or token in existence today, so that alone should be valuable.

2: Another purpose of KIN is to be used as an SDK that programmers/creators could incorporate into whatever they're creating. This portion of it allows for creators to get paid without having to rely on ad spam and can allow for the users of the program to earn or spend KIN coins within said program. This portion of it is a lot more ambitious, but if #1 takes off nicely, then it's safe to assume that a lot of people will jump on the bandwagon and start incorporating the SDK into their gaming apps, websites, and programs.

**ICO, TOKEN, &amp; COIN INFO:**

ERC20:  
The ICO itself was pretty successful, but the token had quite a rough start. They started off as an ERC20 token, but quickly found that the Ethereum network couldn't handle the transaction volume they would introduce to the network, so instead they started looking at other options. 

SCP:  
They narrowed in on the Stellar Conensus Protocol \(SCP\). SCP 'mostly' met the volume KIN was looking for, but had a few other issues that didn't suite a messenger token such as minimum wallet balance, transaction fees, etc. They performed a lot of testing on Stellar's test network and decided that it would work for their needs with a few modifications.

KIN transitions from token to coin:  
So their newest solution was to just fork SCP and create their own coin, but remove wallet minimums and transaction fees. These coins are what will be used by people in their app and in the SDK.

Misc:   
They've stated that they still plan to maintain the ERC20 token version as well and will provide holders an easy way to do a 1\-for\-1 swap between the SCP based coin and the ERC20 based token. Part of their reasoning for maintaining the ERC20 token is because that's already on several exchanges and would allow people to buy or sell KIN easier.",NA,"8orzsh",NA,0,NA,"false",1536337525,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","WARNING","","false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/8orzsh/kin_public_beta_app_available_mid_june/",NA,"7 months old | CT: 39 karma KIN: 1344 karma","false","WARNING","",0,0

I see git as an important historical anecdote we in crypto would be wise to pay attention to. Just because you create a decentralized protocol, it doesn't guarantee things won't end up centralized. The internet itself is another great example of this. It seems that decentralization removes old boundaries, but creates new problems. The companies that solve those problems end up as new, central choke points. Could history repeat itself in Crypto? If fleshed these thoughts out here.

&amp;nbsp;

When I read about the differences between these projects, it's often about differences in consensus protocols, governance, security, speed and scalability, code languages, and launch dates.

&amp;nbsp;

While those mentioned aspects are very important, what's still not clear enough to me is what are the differences between these projects when it comes to use cases and target markets. For instance, some of the questions I have are:

&amp;nbsp; 

* Which of these projects do support transfer of logic (when X happens on chain A, than Y happens on chain B), besides just transfer of value between chains? And for the projects that don't support transfer of logic, are they planning to, and is it possible for them to implement it at all?

&amp;nbsp;

* Which projects do support cross-chain smart contracts? For the projects that don't, are they planning to and able to?

&amp;nbsp;

* Which projects have a generic focus (blockchain agnostic: compatible to all blockchains), and which projects have focus on certain blockchain platforms / markets / countries (e.g. Ethereum/NEO, financial markets, South Korea). For the projects that have focus on certain platforms / markets / countries, are they planning to adopt a more generic approach, and is it even technically possible for them?

* Which projects have a pure interoperability focus, and which projects do interoperability as a 'side thing'?

&amp;nbsp;

* What are other differences in use cases and technical (im)possibilities?

&amp;nbsp;

Obviously, since storage  space is at a premium on most (if not all) major platforms, I am planning to do the following, based off what blockchain.info wallet storage system:

1. The user opens a brower web app where they input their private key. This key is never sent to any servers.
2. The user enters information, such as a shipping address. This shipping address is encrypted by their private key and is linked to the user by a unique GUID. 
3. The now encrypted data and its associated GUID are sent to the server for storage.
4. Later, if the user returns, they input their GUID and receive the encrypted data which is decrypted in their browser once again. 

I was wondering if there were any specific things I should look out for (good practice, etc.). I'm also looking for any libraries that do this already (I'm using NODE.js as backend).

Edit: This will be paired with a dapp that essentially settles the initial payment to the blockchain; the main issue we currently have in the crypto space is that lots of information (aka, the product name, where to ship it to, any customer comments for a custom order) are expensive to store on blockchain platforms. Therefore at least for now I believe that the storage of data needs to be centralized, but also in a manner which minimizes the amount of data the central storage can see and read the data to protect privacy.

Nano voting traffic to be reduced by 99.9% by implementing vote by hash, lazy bootstrapping, and reduced vote rebroadcasting (x-post r/CryptoCurrency)","Voting traffic currently dominates the Nano network (vs actual transactions), because of the size of the votes, the number of times nodes vote, and the number of nodes those votes get rebroadcasted to. This reduces node throughput, makes it harder for low-end nodes to survive increases in transaction traffic, and reduces overall network scalability.

The Nano devs are now implementing a number of interesting solutions that should drastically reduce the voting bandwidth (99.9%) and required disk IO of the Nano protocol, which are the network's two biggest bottlenecks.

Vote by hash - Initial reduction from 40 kilobytes of voting traffic per block to 600 bytes per block (98.5% reduction) by not including the full block in each vote and only using the block's hash.

Lazy bootstrapping - Right now a block may get voted on thousands of times during it’s lifetime by nodes that don’t actually care about the block or chain it’s on — AND they’ll vote on other blocks which reference that block indirectly, leading to thousands of unnecessary votes. Passively listening for blocks and only pulling down chains that a node cares about solves this, and drastically reduces overall voting traffic.

Vote stapling - Votes by reps are signed and distributed with blocks, so that when a node gets a new block that has already been voted on, it will no longer request voting confirmation once more from the representatives. The votes will be sent in a bundle with minimal vote traffic.

Vote rebroadcasting - Since v13, the redundancy of nodes voting 4 times on each block (which in turn are rebroadcast) is no longer needed. This is because nodes now automatically seek them out if they're missing. This leads to lower votes, fewer relays, and will decrease network traffic by 75%.

TL;DR:

Nano is about to get a lot more scalable (99.9% less voting traffic). Stress tests will follow.

Correction from one of the devs on vote stapling: 

&gt; While vote stapling can definitely be used for this (and presumably will be in the future), that's not what it'll be first used for. With vote stapling, when a node publishes a block, it will first communicate directly with representatives to make an aggregate signature. Then, the node will publish the block along with the aggregate signature in the same message. The aggregate signature is the same size as a normal signature, because it uses a multisignature protocol called MuSig: https://blockstream.com/2018/01/23/musig-key-aggregation-schnorr-signatures.html

&gt; This means that we can package up the entire voting process into the size of one vote.

So, what do y'all think? Do these sound like viable solutions to improving Nano's scaling? What other concerns do you have with Nano and its ability to scale?",NA,"92vaqc",NA,0,NA,"false",1536679226,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/92vaqc/addressing_nanos_weaknesses_bandwidth_usage_and/",NA,"Positive | 43305 karma | Karma CT: 311 CC: 8484 NANO: 3040","false","","",0,1

This article doesnt cover all of them, there are so many variants these days. but it does give you a good overview of the consensus mechanisms. 

This is just an education post on the different consensus types, but i would like peoples thoughts on the pros / cons of various consensus protocols. Or variants / new ones that are not commonly known but have great promise.

BFT and its variants seem to be the best performing for permissionless chains, but they lead to centralisation AFAIK (could be wrong). in the case of xrp they plan to decentralise by giving nodes to trusted entities likely banks they do business with i suppose. Stellar im not sure on how decentralised it is. I admit i don't know all the ins and outs of BFT, so id like to know what people think about BFT, pros / cons etc.

I don't like dPoS for one. 

see Vitalik's thoughts on dPoS, his comments came true with the extremely low particpation rate in voting for EOS mainnet. I believe they barely scraped by with the 16% vote to get mainnet live. However that said, EOS did make it difficult and unsecure to vote, using your private key to vote was odd to say the least. perhaps they could have used the public key signed with your private key of the wallet. 

Original post was about eth vs eos Vitalik responds there:
/r/ethereum/comments/6qm0y2/is_the_ethereum_team_defending_their_ground/

&gt; On ""100k transactions per second!!1!1""

&gt; Dan's EOS achieves its high scalability by relying on a small number of what are essentially master nodes of a consortium chain, removing Merkle proofs and any other protections that would allow regular users to audit any part of the system's execution unless they want to personally run a full node themselves. See http://vitalik.ca/general/2017/05/08/coordination_problems.html for why I think this is undesirable.

&gt; On DPOS

&gt; To try to ensure decentralization, DPOS allows all coin holders to vote on who the nodes running the consortium chain are. This, together with the lack of in-protocol economic incentives for these master nodes to behave correctly, and the lack of client-side validation capability, mean that there is an extreme reliance on the voting mechanism. Voting has the following problems:

&gt; Low voter participation (the DAO carbonvote, the current EIP186 carbonvote, the DAO proposal votes, and even Bitshares DPOS votes in 2014 all had &lt;10% participation)
Game-theoretic tragedy-of-the-commons vulnerabilities: because each voter only has a tiny chance of influencing the result, their incentive to vote correctly is thousands of times lower than the socially optimal incentive. This means that situations like everyone putting their coins on exchanges and exchanges voting on users' behalf, with users not really caring how exchanges vote with their money, are likely to happen.
Coin holder interests are not perfectly aligned with user interests, and so proposals that increase coin prices at the expense of making the system useful may get implemented.
Basically, those arguing in favor of coin voting are arguing in favor of the same process as the DAO carbonvote deciding who runs the blockchain and all significant protocol decisions.

&gt; On fees

&gt; EOS has a mechanism where instead of having transaction fees, there is a rule that if you hold N tokens you can send a maximum of N * k transactions per period (see Steem whitepaper). This has quite an undesirable consequence for usability: it means that users have to buy N tokens, and have to be exposed to their volatility. This is especially bad for:

&gt; The poor, who are not interested in putting the entirety of their often very low savings into a funky new cryptoasset in order to be able to use a blockchain.
Anyone who wants to use the blockchain only a few times and then go away (they would need to buy coins and then sell them again)
Anyone who experiences prolonged unexpected spikes in demand (ie. pretty much eveyone); users will have to buy enough coins to cover perhaps the 99th percentile of their expected usage, so that they don't get stuck being ""out of gas"" and having to go to an exchange.
In Ethereum the latter is also true to some extent, but because you have to pay fees, the values involved are much smaller, so buying an extra few dollars of ether just in case is not a big deal.",NA,"92x05n",NA,0,NA,"false",1536680045,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/92x05n/overview_of_consensus_mechanisms/",NA,"Enthusiast","false","","",0,0

I started a research project regarding encryption and it's use on blockchain. I know that the blockchain is transparent, but I've seen some articles regarding Hyperledger where there is a way to have an end to end encryption. Now, I've been researching this for the past few days (well weeks if you count finding out Ethereum is a bust) and I was wondering if any of you have encountered something similar or have an idea or a helpful resource. 

The project would be encrypting something simple as a time stamp string that would be passed on to the blockchain, and it could only be seen after it was decrypted by multi signature authorization.

I know that this isn't the primary use for blockchain, but as i said its a research project just to see if an implementation would be possible. 

Thanks in advance for your help! ",NA,"8vkymp",NA,0,NA,"false",1536473865,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/8vkymp/multi_signature_encryption_on_a_blockchain/",NA,"New to crypto","false","","",0,0

Prior to doing this I had no practical knowledge of Raspberry Pi's or Linux whatsoever. It has been a steep learning curve!

I looked at lots of different PoS cryptocurrencies and for a number of reasons decided to use Denarius to illustrate the example. While the primary goal is to help an absolute newbie build their own stake box, the guide may also encourage more people to get involved with Denarius, which has a very bright future in my honest opinion.

One thing that has come up for me is a question others may have asked (feel free to link that thread and I'll delete this one if you want): why create a whole new ""currency"" for financial transactions on a blockchain?

I use the scare quotes because I'm a BTC skeptic from day one and it doesn't actually seem to be a real currency--it has no intrinsic value, it's a terrible store of value because of its volatility and as yet it's a very poor medium of exchange because so few vendors accept it. It seems to me that it's an ideological/political imposition onto an otherwise neutral bit of technology that has monopolized the space for using blockchain as a means of concluding financial transactions. Wouldn't be just as easy for me to use blockchain to transfer dollars or euros or whatever without having to engage with the conceit of a new bankless currency? 

Maybe I'm missing something, and I'm sure there are BTC believers who can argue otherwise--I'm eager to hear that. I don't need an ideological debate about whether central banks or the government are good things, just a better understanding of the technology here. To me it seems like someday people might laugh that they thought you'd need a whole new currency to spend money to people with the blockchain. Why am I wrong?

I had some success asking a pretty elementary question here a week or so ago (I also got some shitty replies, but that’s Reddit for you); I wanted to do that again if I may. Pardon me if this is wasting the sub’s time.

So here’s where I’m curious. Cryptocurrency believers/supporters/whatever get excited when the price of their currency goes up--we’ll just stick with Bitcoin for the rest of this since it’s the granddaddy of them all. Bitcoin prices go up and y’all all get excited, and the more it rises, the quicker it rises, the better. This is all presented as a good thing.

But if Bitcoin is actually a currency and not some sort of security why is this a good thing? If it’s a security that’s a problem since there’s no underlying asset here being valued in money since it is money itself, right? It would be a purely speculative instrument, which is what skeptics claim, and subject to the same forces of gravity as tulip bulbs or Beanie Babies or dotcom stocks or mortgage backed securities. The difference is that unlike tulips or dolls or companies/securities that don’t do anything there is some inherent utility to Bitcoin--you can use it for cash-like secure, anonymous transactions in a virtual environment or IRL without needing to rely upon any bank, including central banks.  

This utility, however, is only as valuable as the extent of Bitcoin’s adoption as a means of exchange. Who wants a currency you can’t use anywhere? Thing is, those big price increases everyone loves are tantamount to massive deflation of the currency, and deflationary pressures favor hoarding and discourage spending. If I had reason to believe that the dollar would double in value in the next month I want to hang on to as many dollars as I can because whatever I spend them on now I’ll be able to get twice as much in just a month. This is even more important for capitalists, because few investments will be able to match the return I can get just by hanging onto my money, especially since they’ll have a hard time selling anything with everyone hanging onto their dollars. Deflation is seen as a really bad thing for economies because it can bring economic activity to a halt.

So the more Bitcoin keeps going up or promising to go up the less Bitcoin holders want to spend them on mundane products, which means fewer vendors have any reason to take them, which stunts their utility and makes them operate more as that object of speculation than a real currency. It also seems like these deflationary pressures are baked in with the cap on supply and the POW algorithm keeping block production steady at every 10 minutes. 

Wouldn’t an effective cryptocurrency designed to actually be used as money seek to keep value fluctuation within certain boundaries? They could speed up block generation when value gets too high and throttle it when it’s getting too low. Then folks holding the currency could treat it like money, saving it only because they might want to buy things later, not because they think someone will pay them more money (which is a sign that it isn’t actually money itself, right?) for it later. Vendors would be encouraged to accept it because their customers want to spend it, thus giving it real value. Bitcoin clearly isn’t doing this, are there other altcoins that are seeking to keep their values relatively steady? Is this all old shit that everyone already knows and talks about? 

Note that I get that this would involve a form of centralization (there's an oracle problem here, right? how does the algorithm know what the value is?), but it seems like there’s an inherent tradeoff within cryptocurrency between the desire for decentralization and its actual efficacy as a currency. Effectively there’s a contradiction between the politics at the founding of this project and its actual function, right? 

Interested in hearing what y’all think. ",NA,"90w0o1",NA,0,NA,"false",1536645493,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/90w0o1/why_are_big_price_increases_for_crypto_a_good/",NA,"47985 karma | Karma CT: 108","false","","",0,1

Because of this noise it is complicated to concentrate on real problems and current challenges for Crypto World and community.  

So here is what I mean:

\- \~ 600 BC Metal Coins appeared.

\-&gt; 2009 Bitcoin p2p Electronic Cash System, which operates without any central authority, was launched and allowed to make transactions without banks and removed government monopoly on minting, distribution and control of money.

\-&gt; 2010 Mt Gox appeared, allowed to buy and sell Bitcoin.

\-&gt; 2012/2013 Peercoin/NXT appeared trying to replace PoW with PoS.

\-&gt; many altcoins appeared, 2013 Mastercoin launched, which allowed to create coins on top of Bitcoin layer.  

\-&gt;  this idea was elaborated and in 2015 Ethereum was launched, that widely introduced smart contracts, ability to create own tokens and develop dapps on top of Ethereum blockchain. ICOs became trendy.

\-&gt; 2017 Lightening Network launched that enabled fast transactions for Bitcoin and micropayments.

Of course I mentioned not everything, a lot of things seems to be done, but more to come.

What's next for crypto industry? What are the most important Challenges now, what problems/weaknesses should be solved? Who is trying to solve them now and how?

PS please don't post in comments shitty projects - ""copies of existing services but on blockchain"" it has nothing to do with bright future and development of Bitcoin's and cryptocurrencies' World.

What if we could make the computers inaccessible? In a local network, one wouldn't have to worry about consensus or double spending. A network of satellites could host a ""cryptocurrency"".

A very ambitious project to say the least. But is it possible? How could you trust that the satellites were constructed in a fair way? Perhaps there could be several independent teams monitoring the construction. The entire process could even be broadcasted on a live stream if needed.

Making transactions and checking account balance would be the only type of input a satellite could receive. Updating the code from earth would therefore not be possible.

You would need to be able to verify that nodes work as intended. Each satellite could have sensors and circuits that registers the state of the machine. Before making a transaction, one could download a proof that everything is still operational.

The satellites would need to synchronize somehow. Preferably in a way that does not open up any attack vectors from earth. Perhaps a special receiver that could only communicate with nearby objects. Or a header with a cryptographic proof that a signal is coming from another satellite.",NA,"93j4hl",NA,0,NA,"false",1536690587,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/93j4hl/hosting_a_cryptocurrency_from_space/",NA,"Karma CT: 10 BATProject: 463 ETH: 261","false","","",0,0

From the top of my head I could only think of Decred and Aragon for strong governance approach, but am sure there are many more, with new and interesting takes.

As an aside, does anyone know of a project that would allow the formation and organisation of small communities through a smart contract which they could govern, but would link to a larger smart contract governing a larger community and so on... I thought maybe Aragon but was interested to know others/ other takes on this - do people see a project like Decentraland heading in this direction?

It would be difficult for a test to cover a lot of subjects because this is a very dynamic and fast-moving space.  For example the reward structure or hashing algorithm of a coin could be changed within a month of the test being created.  However, there are established concepts, standards, and cryptography used across most projects.  These could include BIPs, HD wallets, merkle proofs, proof systems, or even the blockchain structure itself.  And certainly knowledge of the root concepts like those in bitcoin explain a lot about almost all other projects in the space.

We know jobs are opening up all over the place for this industry and it seems like this would be a useful cert for employees and employers to determine a baseline skill level.

/Quote:

Our discussions so far have focused on what are known as fungible tokens across a range of platforms. Bitcoin are fungible because each Bitcoin is the same as any other Bitcoin. They can be used interchangeably because they are identical. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), however, allow for characteristics to be added to create unique tokens.

## What can we do with NFTs?

Although[ not the first](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks), NFTs shot to prominence in late 2017 with the rise of[ CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/), an Ethereum based game featuring thousands of digital kittens. Despite the seemingly simple premise it exemplifies many of the reasons why NFTs are exciting:

* **Uniqueness**: Each CryptoKitty is unique, with NFTs able to be imbued with a distinct set of characteristics. In this case, it includes colour, facial expressions and fur
* **Digital scarcity**: NFTs retain the scarcity associated with Bitcoin but amend it from 21 million (the maximum supply of Bitcoin) to as low as one. This scarcity (proved by the blockchain) means we can create both unique and irreplicable digital goods
* **Interoperable:** Because they remain blockchain based tokens ([ERC-721](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md) tokens as opposed to the more usual ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum) owners can utilise NFTs in different ways e.g. ‘breeding’ two CryptoKitties to create offspring with new distinguishing factors
* **Platform:** This interoperability provides the potential for third party services to build on top of NFTs. For example, CryptoKitties became the basis for other games such as HyperDragons - by ‘eating’ a kitten, players could increase their dragon’s strength
* **Composability:** Whereas the ERC-721 standard allows for tokens with unique characteristics, the[ newer ERC-998 token proposal](https://medium.com/the-notice-board/erc-998-the-new-token-on-the-block-f3f6cbebdffc) would see ERC-721 tokens able to hold accessories e.g. ball of string for your kitten

## How can NFTs revolutionize the gaming market?

The gaming market is an obvious use case for NFTs, which be used within the digital collectibles market, to improve the gaming experience and ultimately drive mass adoption of cryptoassets.

People love to collect items, even those with seemingly no intrinsic value. This is borne out by the recent success of[Fortnite](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/), a free to play game which posted[ revenues in May of $318m](https://www.recode.net/2018/6/26/17502072/fortnite-revenue-game-growth-318-million) purely on the sale of non-essential ‘cosmetic’ items. They pay substantial amounts – often in the thousands of dollars -  for rare items. How much would gamers pay for provably one of a kind items? How much fervor would be created by a popular streamer selling off their weapons? This wouldn’t be using the same weapon as your favorite streamer used, this would be owning and using their actual weapon - something no-one else could ever say or do.

This would also lend itself to branding opportunities, as companies could provide unique in-game items tied to their own services (e.g. just as luxury car manufacturers limit physical scarcity, so too could they create a limited number of digital cars).

These digital collectibles would also tie into other collectible markets such as trading cards, which remains a large market. For example, Major League Baseball recently announced its intention to[ create an Ethereum based game](https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/13/17568766/mlb-cryptocurrency-baseball-game-summer) to capture a younger and digital first market for whom physical cards may feel slightly outdated.

## Improving the gaming experience

NFTs can also remove the centralized services upon which gamers currently rely. For example, gamers must currently sell their items through either opaque over the counter deals or through fee taking centralized services. NFTs, however, could be transferred freely with selling items becoming as easy as sending a normal transaction.

What’s more, these items would become the property of their owner. At present items can be arbitrarily taken away from you; items are leased, not owned. With NFTs, however, the items cannot be taken from you. The whole world can see which accounts owns the NFT and full transaction history. This will give people more security and confidence when buying.

NFTs also offer the ability to create new gaming experiences. Items and avatars could be combined. Your avatar could become transferrable – along with all its earned accessories – from game to game. Instead of items being designed to be used within games, we may find situations where developers are designing games around items. Third party services will spring up to service and augment these new possibilities, and this will bring forth new ideas.

## Driving mass adoption

Gaming, a global and digital first environment in which microtransactions are increasingly frequent, may prove to be the area to drive real usage of cryptoassets. Cryptoassets are generally cumbersome to use for the average person (albeit this is improving), but we will see games and platforms begin to install crypto wallets within the games themselves, enabling players to hold NFTs without realizing they are using the underlying DLT.

This newly installed consumer base offers the potential to drive new business models and increase player interaction. For example, it would enable users to buy unique digital objects as gifts for their favorite streamer, which the recipient could then sell on, a means to earn their income. Games could do crossover events, with items from one game duplicating in the other - a simple airdrop. Consoles could create ‘home’ environments to replace the current static dashboards in which players could wander around personal museums that display their rarest items, with other players allowed to visit, marvel and bid to buy the digital artefacts.

It would also allow users to bet items, with PvP gaming taking on a whole new dynamic as players wage their wares against one another, driving new forms of competitive gaming. They could be used to monetize skill and loyalty, as players could be rewarded with items by developers for a whole host of activities including in-game success, being active members of the community, birthdays/anniversaries, length of service and ultimately money spent in-game.

These developments would serve to drive the already large but still nascent e-sports scene. Rather than a few superstars taking home the bulk of winnings, the professional gamer market would change to enable hundreds of thousands of players to earn their living inside digital worlds.

We already spend increasing amounts of time cultivating our digital profiles. Although games such as CryptoKitties may seem basic, they hint at a future where digital objects increasingly resemble the value of physical ones. NFTs will become another building block in the ‘Internet of Value’, where items that were once consumable and replicable become valuable owing to their scarcity. Bitcoin introduced scarcity to a decentralized digital currency, but NFTs may be the means to introduce the concept to a much wider audience.

The code has been written and in a couple days (once we pass our specified block height for the rules to go into effect on our testnet) the testing will begin. Below is a clip from page 14 and 15.

\----

In short, Lynx business rules discourage mining for profit and this differentiates Lynx from most other cryptocurrencies currently in production. By rendering mining unprofitable, the electricity needed to mine and run the global Lynx network is minimal. Ultimately, this is an eco-friendly solution because it supports environmental sustainability. And, because of the redundancies in the network design and the enhanced coin parameters, the coin is secure.

\----

... and

\----

## Hybrid Proof of Work Rules

1. A single miner can’t win a block more than once every 30 minutes.
2. The miner’s reward address balance must be greater than or equal to a required fluctuating minimum amount of Lynx to win a block.
3. By using random selection, the fastest miners are not always guaranteed to win the block reward.

Lynx implements a series of business rules that must be met by the miner to successfully get a candidate block accepted by the network. Taken together, the three business rules result in “Hybrid Proof of Work” (HPoW).

I'm interested in critical feedback and thoughts by other developers interested in this design.

As far as I can tell, it's a permissioned chain with public read-acces.

I think this might be a great solution for usecases where you only want certain actors to push information on the network, but also some public transparency (supply chain with consumer end user).

Does anyone know technology (Hyperledger or other ooen source technology) that can provide this kind of services? Do you see some glaring problems with these types of chains?

*Helix* is a **scalable** and **Byzantine fault-tolerant** consensus protocol for ordering transactions that ensures the resulting order is **fairly** determined. A key element in the *Helix* ledger is a source of **common and verifiable randomness**, which is used in helping obtain both scalability and fairness.

Helix assumes two types of participants: Nodes that take part in the consensus and users issuing transactions of the nodes. It randomly selects nodes to propose new blocks of transactions which are verified through a bounded-size committee of nodes. Thus it reduces the number of nodes that actively participate in a costly consensus.

Fairness is also obtained in this regard. Nodes are selected in an unbiased manner to participate in committees or to propose blocks, based on a unique reputation instead of PoW or PoS. *Helix* also aims to assure fairness on transaction confirmation time and throughput by having the users encrypt their transactions prior to publishing them.

Overall, this consensus model sounds pretty promising.

#The Implications of Bitcoin - Deciphering the Enigma


Money is one of the oldest technologies; it's older than writing; we know this because the first writing we find is keeping track of transactions. Money has held many forms (rock, bone, metal, paper, cloth, plastic, etc.), each generation of token ideally being more portable and harder to forge. Portability, (ease of moving around the tokens) increases what you can do with it, while forgeability describes how secure it is against counterfeiters. Modern banking is essentially impossible to forge, and is vastly more portable than physical tokens because it exists solely on banking networks. For those with access to modern banks, money has never been more free to move around. Enter Bitcoin; it is no less forgeable than its predecessor,but it's portability is exponentially increased, and being decentralized it introduces a new feature, it's open to everyone.

##What is Bitcoin?

At first glance bitcoin appears very similar to how we already transact in the developed world; it's ""just"" digital money. We have paypal, venmo, online banking, and credit cards that allow us to move our money around. However, to call bitcoin similar is making a huge mistake and vastly misunderstanding its concept, philosophy, and power. Modern banking services are exclusive to the developed world  and only accessed with the permission of for-profit, private institutions, the gatekeepers of local and global money transfer. In the developing world there are billions of people without access to any bank, and many more have limited access to even basic services. Often there's little competition which stifles innovation and increases monopolistic practices. It's these citizens of our global society that stand to benefit most from this technology in an immediate sense.

Bitcoin is a decentralized, open, and immutable means of exchanging value. There are several layers to this concept alone; most significantly, that bitcoin is fundamentally different from anything we have ever contemplated. This makes it difficult to understand the implications or benefits of such a revolutionary technology. It's an epochal shift in how we can transact and store value.

This system can be accessed by everyone, anywhere, anytime. It is neutral, trans-national, and facilitates the freedom of money. Bitcoin itself requires no personal information or account creation through a business, nation, or organization. One simply generates keys and is free to transact with anyone. There isn't a central authority to dictate who can and can't use the network, no gatekeepers, no one to freeze payments or hold funds.

#How is Bitcoin Secure?

I think people are well-justified to be skeptical of bitcoin's security, it's often touted as ""unhackable"" or ""immutable"". I try not to speak in absolutes; so I simply state that it's not worth trying to hack because its security lies in cryptography and game-theory.

If you guessed my private key you could spend coins associated with that address. Computers can guess many times in a a second, but even with every computer on the planet it would take much longer than the universe has existed to guess the private keys to a single bitcoin address. This is still true even with 1,000 earths worth of computing power. This is cryptographic security. 

Game theory sounds daunting but it's easy to understand, it's ""the study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers."" In bitcoin this manifests through ""proof of work"" which amounts to ""miners"" using computers to do lots of math problems, the results of which get embedded in the transaction record (the blockchain), and they receive rewards for their effort of mining a block. Miners are incentivized to contribute to the system.

##So what if we try to cheat? 

The amount of money and resources required to assemble enough computing power to even attempt to cheat the system (the ""51% attack"") would cost more than any benefits of doing so because the attack has no guarantee of working, and it would be obvious to anyone looking at the transaction record. In some cases the cheating transaction could be routed-around, essentially erased, negating all the work put in by the attacker who still had to pony up all the computing hardware and electricity. It's simply more profitable to take those computing resources and just mine bitcoins instead of attempting an attack. Game theory at its finest.

Many criticize the computing power and electricity ""wasted"" on bitcoin mining. Another perspective is that all this computational expenditure is quite intentional because it maintains the security of the system. It's analogous to mining gold; gold ore is just a pile of rocks that require significant extraction and refining to yield highly valuable and useful gold.  Bitcoin's proof of work is so-called because the blockchain is evidence of massive computation, that computation equals security. The security is what makes bitcoin valuable. The proof of work is the proof that energy and computing power were expended in securing a history that can never be altered. Furthermore, renewable energy can increasingly provide electricity for miners mitigating environmental concerns. Not to mention the environmental impact of continuously replacing paper currencies in hundreds of countries, gold mining resources ""wasted"" on gold just to sit in vaults, or all of the concrete and steel poured into thousands of banks across the globe.

#What can it do?

Right now citizens of Venezuela are losing purchasing power of their money by 25,000% per year. Their failing government continues printing more money robbing constituents of their savings. When this happened in Zimbabwe and people needed wheelbarrows full of money to buy a single loaf of bread the residents had little recourse. But some Venezuelan locals are turning to crypto-currencies to flee the currency crisis, escape the inflation, and protect their ability to acquire food and shelter. It's capital flight away from a national currency without having to even leave their neighborhood because their $20 cell phone can now act like a global bank.

Global remittances account for over 500 billion dollars a year. International money transfer services require physically being near the local office during business hours. A fair amount of coordination is required to find an institution with local access in both countries. Transfers can take days to clear, and fees vary wildly and make it difficult to transfer small amounts. Bitcoin can send a transaction at any time from your phone to anywhere on the globe in seconds with negligible fees without any intermediary. It's not hard to see why in some places this industry is being heavily disrupted.

Credit cards are a ""pull"" system, meaning you give out your card number and anyone can pull money from it, this model is the cause of credit and debit card fraud. If your card info is ever compromised you will need a replacement card and sometimes have to fight with institutions for weeks, months, or years to get your money back or have your credit restored. Bitcoin is a ""push"" system, only you can spend your money. No fees or extra charges can ever be added without you manually sending them. Automatic payments can be set up on your end, but never ""their"" end.

Bitcoin is programmable and flexible, allowing money to flow around the world as easily as cat videos and memes. It can mimic the way we do business currently when we desire, but, so much more is possible that will never be viable with our current systems. In fact, we haven't even figured out what yet is possible because innovation has just begun. Until now the only ones that could innovate in the financial space are those with the connections to permissioned worldwide banking network. Now, a 19 year-old has created a global computer whereby the programs can never be silenced and money itself can be programmed. Ultimately this enables anyone to write the next killer banking app without permission from anyone; it's a free market of money.

I plan to use it in pools, but I am not sure about the rewards system. Here what I have in mind, please tell me if you think it will work or suggest a modification.

Whenever a miner finds a better hash, he will send it to the pool. The pool will remember the best hash from each miner. In case the pool wins the block here how it will reword the miners:

There is **N** miner in the pool, each of the miner's hashes is a number, **Hi** between **0** to **2\^32** where **i** is the miner id from **1** to **N**.

The pool will pick some High number **K** such that it's bigger than all the **Hi** numbers and will calculate: **k / H1 + k/H2 + k/H3... + K/hi = P**

Oh dear!  


My confusion is over that last part, why would anyone (who values their stake in the block-chain) ever do this; its literally destroying the core integrity of the PoS chain in question by preventing consensus.  
I've seen these fictional fork minters described as 'rational' becasue they can do this and not miss any block rewards/transaction fees; but its utterly 'irrational' to risk destroying 100% of the value of your stake, in exchange for a marginal gain until a temporary fork is resolved.  Essentially, in PoS, if you are minting blocks, you always have something at stake...  


If an attacker tries it then that maybe something that I dont quite get.  
Maybe that attacker has a pretty decent amount of stake, in which they can just try classic double-spend, no?  
Or the attacker is very very very lucky in that they are the small holder who will prevent an otherwise exactly matched 50/50 pair of forks (destroying the same coin weight over the same blocks) from ever resolving.  


But in both of those bad actor scenarios, we come back to an attacker with stake at stake, and they must be willing to risk destruction of their stake, via destruction of consensus, to do the attack.  A wealthy vandal perhaps, but then that isnt unique to PoS, a determined wealthy vandal can attack other protocols.

Basically this is just recreating the original gold standard the US dollar had but in digital form, with the privacy features of cash, the permission-less capabilities of cryptocurrency. And yes the speed and stability of a centralized system. Say it was pegged to 1 dollar worth of bitcoin or X amount of sats that could be exchanged at anytime without question. 

Would a nation ever adopt such a system? How would the internationally community react if it began threatening their economies? If for example large percentages of their citizens started using the foreign privacy coins to conduct commerce and evade taxes.

Obviously the main central point of failure, the people/gov who maintain the network, would have to be protected by an army and be committed to non-censorship but lets assume that's covered in this scenario

"1026280",1532376727,"CryptoTechnology","superbleester","self.CryptoTechnology","https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/91aike/a_new_generation_of_erc20_tokens_and_their/",15,18,NA,NA,"A new generation of ERC20 tokens and their implications inside and outside of the EVM","Until recently, the only way to obtain ERC20 tokens was through means other than PoW. There is a reason Satoshi chose PoW over anything else, letting anyone mine their fair share of whatever they wanted. The EIP 918 token standard has changed Ethereum tokens forever. This protocol allows users to submit work and receive tokens through the [mint()] function utilizing EIP 918 within the token. Using EIP 918 anyone can create ERC20 tokens that are distributed purely through PoW. Now if that doesn't intrigue you, this next part will. The creator of EIP 918 also created his own token, 0xBTC. 0xBTC is the same as BTC, but on Ethereum. I know we are all tired of clones and forks, but this is a technological breakthrough. It isn't a clone, it was built from the ground up in solidity (https://etherscan.io/token/0xb6ed7644c69416d67b522e20bc294a9a9b405b31) and utilizes the solidity-SHA3 (keccakSHA-3) algorithm for distribution. 0xBTC was the first ever working mineable ERC20 token to utilize EIP 918 and is a huge milestone for Ethereum technology as a whole. Pure mined currencies have shown to be good stores of value and having this within Ethereum now is really cool.

Due to the nature of ERC20 tokens, they can be interfaced an infinite number of ways. One recent implementation of this factor is merge mining with 0xBTC. How this works is that tokens can be distributed based on a users work done on mining 0xBTC (or any other token ,this is the only one it has been made for so far). For example a token called 0xLTC was created and is given to users mining 0xBTC on a 4:1 scale. 4 0xLTC for every 1 0xBTC mined (on the mike.rs 0xBTC pool). This is huge as that means anyone can fairly distribute their own tokens through merge mining anything or from 0xBTC. Use cases like this are of infinite number due to the nature of ERC20 tokens. Since PoW is fully integrated. Since any Pow ERC20 token is, well, an ERC20 token this means its functionalities are endless. ERC20 tokens can already atomic swap with other currencies on any number of DEX’s.

Pow distributed coins usually have a huge issue. It plagues them all. The dreaded 51% attack. Now here is the thing; with EIP 918 distributed ERC20 tokens, they inherently do not have that issue. Security for EIP 918 tokens is given by the Ethereum network, meaning a 51% attack on a PoW token would require a 51% attack on Ethereum (nearly impossible). This means that for say 0xBTC that PoW is used PURELY as means of distribution. Another awesome benefit of a token running on Ethereum is that it also scales with Ethereum.

Another recent development involving this protocol is Lava Wallet. The creator of 0xBTC also the creator of EIP 918) has almost finished (in my opinion) one of his biggest projects yet. Lava Wallet will allow users to use 0xBTC with no Ethereum, emulating it having its own chain. You will pay no gas to send 0xBTC only 0xBTC as the fee. This may not seem as huge as I make it out to be, but hear me out. Due to the nature of ERC20’s, Lava Wallet will work for any ERC20 token. This is big because right now sending ERC20 tokens isn’t as easy as most cryptocurrencies. You have to enter contract addresses, set gas prices, and it’s not easy for most. Lava Wallet will change that. A network of packet relayers will be paying the gas and receiving the fees. This will also create a new economic sphere of competition to profit off being a relayer.

Even more recently is something called “King of the Hill” was created. I cannot explain this well enough, so here is an article explaining it (written by the creator): https://medium.com/@admazzola/a-revolutionary-new-ethereum-smart-contract-pow-king-of-the-hill-5b68e6d9a51c In the creators words when asked what KoH is they replied with, “Hey so basically KoH is simply a system by which there is a global address variable called 'the king address' It is only a single variable in a single specific contract Anyone can call the method to change that variable , but they are only allowed to change it if they are minting a 0xBTC block at the exact same time With me so far ??? (don't ask how this is possible, read the contract - it's slightly confusing) (it's just possible) That it literally all there is to it...... So don't overcomplicate it too much”.

Anyways I hope you guys found this interesting, if you have any questions I would love to answer them! Thanks for your time and have an amazing day!

Better than relying on 10 different wallet apps, but worse than using a real hardware wallet.

* Both iphones and most new androids support hardware Trusted Execution Environments (google for ""TEE android"")
   * That means it's incredibly hard for a malicious app to read the data

So I was thinking of making (or contributing to) a Key Store app that used that. The app would pop up with a notification with the amount and address when you used a different wallet app to make a transaction, just like on a Ledger S, and you'd have to click ""accept"" or ""deny"" which would require a pin or fingerprint. And that's **all it would do**.

* The app would also try to close the biggest security hole that exists with app wallets (imo): **updates**. When you launch the app it would pop up with information on how to disable automatic updates to the app through the app store, and it would only push out updates extremely rarely (yearly?) which were peer reviewed. And only to close security holes or to add new signing methods (just like a Ledger S).
   * rare updates give tech savvy users a chance to review the subreddits before updating, like I do with my Ledger
* The code would try to be as minimalistic and readable as possible, with the fewest features manageable for the sake of auditability.
* You could only see the private key phrases once at the start to write it down on paper (just ripping off Ledger here).

What do you all think? Personally I believe an app like that would would greatly improve security for users who don't use hardware wallets (moms and pops), and improve usability (no more having to manage per-wallet security)",NA,"91bcgy",NA,0,NA,"false",1536652740,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/91bcgy/app_idea_a_keystore_app_that_acts_like_a_ledger/",NA,"17563 karma | Karma CT: 70","false","","",0,0

DGX claims to be backed by physical gold and is thus linked to its spot price (1g of gold = 1 DGX)

On looking at its [website](https://digix.global/app/#/provenance/assets-explorer/assets-list) I see that it claims to [charge a 0.6% demurrage fee per annum](https://i.imgur.com/nAZQBuZ.png). This seems logical as there are costs associated with storing, insuring and moving physical gold.

My question here is is this even possible with an ERC20 token? I'd assumed that if I had 1000 of an ERC20 token behind a private key there would be no way someone could take 6 of them leaving me with 994 outside of me sending a transaction. Is there a way to build in such a method in an ERC20 or are Digix accomplishing this demurrage fee in another way?",NA,"91q91t",NA,0,NA,"false",1536659819,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/91q91t/can_erc20_tokens_deduct_a_holding_fee/",NA,"Karma CT: 19 CC: 1698","false","","",0,0

i'm trying to compile a list of eco friendly cryptos.

Here are 5 Eco-Friendly Crypto Use Cases I know of:

5) BitcoinClean - claims to be the first eco friendly crypto, but i can't confirm since afaik, there have been others before. Can anyone confirm their claim?

4) Burst Coin - claims to be the most eco friendly crypto because they use ""Proof of Storage"" rather than other proof types, and they claim that Proof of Storage is the most energy efficient way of maintaining a cryptocurrency. What i'd like to know is what will be the next best way to mine efficiently?  Will we eventually plug devices into ourselves to mine using our own bio energy?  I know it sounds far-fetched.  Then again, pacemakers once sounded far-fetched. So did electric cars. So did going to the Moon. 

3) EcoCoin - claims to be a living currency, asset-backed by real trees, and the cryptocurrency slowly deteriorates over time, and dies, just like real trees, in a process called ""demurrage"". 

2) Electrominer is a Solar-Powered Mining Platform. This is just a straight fuel-type play, where they remove as much traditional fuel as possible from the mining process, and replace with good ol' sunshine. Of course that means any location that does this, is limited to hours of actual sunshine, which is at best about 12 hours a day on average, and in reality it's about half to two-thirds of that in most places. 

1) EMJAC is a Wasted Tires to Crypto Token Platform. They basically recycle old tires and as part of that process, they create EMJAC cryptocurrency tokens, which are based on ERC20. Their use case is primarily in rapidly developing countries like in SE Asia, which means the financial incentives are potentially even greater for the tire recyclers. It also means that the impact may be seen and felt faster and larger than in some other global regions. 

While I like them all, I love to cyle and drive a lot. So I have a great deal of personal attachment and interest in the EMJAC token. Also, they're really solving a huge, visible problem (piles of slowly polluting tires), and addressing real value to a massive market need (acquisition of more asset-backed money by the people for their ecofriendly contributions in developing nations). They're literally removing a blight from the face of the Earth that we all live on. And they're giving people who might otherwise not have a compelling reason to do anything about it, a genuinely valuable way to participate in the process of cleaning up the environment locally, which does affect the global quality. this goes right to the heart of doing something Glocal.

Also I like the ecocoin idea, because saving trees is a good thing. We do need them to survive. But I'm not sure I like that they decay their currency over time, even if it is a brilliant idea .. i don't think most people will fully appreciate it for quite some time, if ever.  Even if we all know that the money we all use day to day is decaying anyway.  We still don't want that to be part of the declared way the money we use, works. i think people would prefer that it's not said, even if it's true. Still, it's worthy of being included on any ecofriendly crypto list, I think.  Anyway I'm rambling.   

What other ecofriendly cryptocurrencies or crypto projects or initiatives do you know of and think should be included in such a list?  And what, if any, thoughts do you have about the 5 I listed above, or others that are out there?

Thanks!",NA,"980hrm",NA,0,NA,"false",1536767566,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/980hrm/ecofriendly_crypto_tech_use_case_list/",NA,"4 cmnt karma | New to crypto","false","","",0,0

Nano uses Proof of Work (PoW) to prevent spam instead of fees. Since PoW can be precomputed, it's not a big deal for peer-to-peer transactions, but it is a huge bottleneck for services that need to send a large amount of transactions (e.g. exchanges).

To solve this, /u/jayycox is developing a service that allows anyone to contribute their spare CPU/GPU cycles to pre-compute PoW and get paid for it.

---

This is a pretty interesting idea to me, because it could turn into a good way to promote adoption by allowing people to ""mine"" for the good of the Nano ecosystem. This also allows people to obtain some amount of Nano for ""free"", which is particularly useful to countries like Venezuela. Part of the reason Banano has taken off there is because you can still earn it by playing simple games.

My main concern is that this could turn into a vector of attack for the network, kind of like renting Nicehash for 51% attacks.

The other day [someone asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/938iwl/integrity_of_the_dag/) if anyone has done research on the reliability of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Here is a pretty recent research paper about this topic. The third part of the paper, where the authors discuss the mathematics of DAG, is quite math-intensive and can be overwhelming. Nonetheless, the first two parts of the paper are very interesting to read. They first propose some applications of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) in cyber-physical systems. Then in part 2, they discuss basic DLT's desired properties, Blockchain, DAG, and Blockchain vs. DAG from a cyber-physical perspective. Please treat this paper as an advanced introduction to the DLT paradigm.

&gt;*Abstract*—This paper describes how Distributed Ledger Technologies can be used to design a class of cyber-physical systems, as well as to enforce social contracts and to orchestrate the behaviour of agents trying to access a shared resource. The first part of the paper analyses the advantages and disadvantages of using Distributed Ledger Technologies architectures to implement certain control systems in an Internet of Things (IoT) setting, and then focuses on a specific type of DLT based on a Directed Acyclic Graph. In this setting we propose a set of delay differential equations to describe the dynamical behaviour of the Tangle, an IoT-inspired Directed Acyclic Graph designed for the cryptocurrency IOTA. The second part proposes an application of Distributed Ledger Technologies as a mechanism for dynamic deposit pricing, wherein the deposit of digital currency is used to orchestrate access to a network of shared resources. The pricing signal is used as a mechanism to enforce the desired level of compliance according to a predetermined set of rules. After presenting an illustrative example, we analyze the control system and provide sufficient conditions for the stability of the network.",NA,"947g8d",NA,0,NA,"false",1536702649,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","","noflair","false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/947g8d/distributed_ledger_technology_cyberphysical/",NA,"Student","false","","",0,0

Lately I have been struck by some sort of realization I had. That even if all the challenges blockchain faces right now (scalability, privacy, proven use cases etc) are solved, still the technology may be broken at the core. 

After witnessing the way the majority of the population is behaving in various states of the world, there is something upseting to me about the idea that our money, information and all other things people think of putting on the blockchain should be secured by the masses. Even if they are independent, they can easily be manipulated by some machiavelic genius to go against the idea of imutability(as an example lookup the DAO). Can we really trust the masses (masses that for example can elect someone like Trump for president) with everything we have precious?

this was posted on bitcoin about making PoW deal with the issues of fees when blocks get full, esp when block size is fixed and too small to handle the the transactions. tx prices went high in the jan dec boom for btc for example. 

thread title is misleading as its more about keeping tx fees stable. lower when they are higher and higher when they are lower. 

he also addresses a potential problem with miners when the reward of a block is gone, thought that was pretty interesting

&gt; Instability of blockchains with no block reward: in the long run, blockchains where there is no issuance (including Bitcoin and Zcash) at present intend to switch to rewarding miners entirely through transaction fees. However, there are known results showing that this likely leads to a lot of instability, incentivizing mining ""sister blocks"" that steal transaction fees, opening up much stronger selfish mining attack vectors, and more. There is at present no good mitigation for this.

The long term vision is that the function of the contract would be a 3d representation of an object, with the individual units of crypto being pixels/voxels of a specific material.

For example, making it possible to create a digital necklace of gold, silver and copper, comprised of bitcoin, litecoin and vertcoin. It would be arranged into a necklace by a designer, who would have to work within the constraints of the amount of ""raw material"" that he has. He could then sign his work of art and distribute it. Transferring the token would effectively be sending all of the crypto within it as well, giving it concrete value - and it may have additional value created through the configuration/art of the creation, the rarity of the item and or the identity of it's creator. One could of course always ""smelt"" this digital item to collect the crypto in it's elemental form and spend it. This could then create a market of digital objects and artists, with the longest term vision making them digital objects that can be physically manipulated and transferred in AR/VR. Anyone would then be able to look at the object and literally see the value of it, just like real jewelry. In the exact same way that we know a gold necklace is worth more than a bracelet, because it simply contains more gold.

Like imagine the Oscars in 2050, where an actress is walking down the red carpet wearing a necklace of pure bitcoin designed by Versace, which unequivocally cost millions of dollars to produce and was unequivocally designed by Versace, and is unequivocally unique - these are all verifiable facts on public blockchain(s). And if she wanted, after having ""worn"" it, she can sell the necklace in whole to someone else for far more than even she paid for it, because it is now *the one and only* necklace that this famous actress worn to the 2050 oscars. This rich person could then display and show it off, and again because everything is publicly verifiable on blockchains, everyone who saw it would know it was the real deal. 
 
In theory I know its possible to create such a thing - I suspect it doesn't exist yet though. What are the biggest roadblocks standing in the way of creating something like this?",NA,"98lb3d",NA,0,NA,"false",1536777518,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/98lb3d/possible_to_wrap_multiple_cryptos_in_a_single/",NA,"46640 karma | Karma CT: 110 CC: 1714 BTC: 1057","false","","",0,0

To my surprise stamp.io seems abandoned, the proof isn't coming through and competing services seem to have disappeared off the internet.

Did people not use blockchain notarization? Is it simply dead as a technology?


To go a little into the topic blockchain notarization is a tech that deals with putting hashes of documents on public blockchains. In this way the hash is forever stored there and you can honestly say ""at this time we had this document with this signature"". It's legally binding too.

Putting a hash on a public blockchain can be done in many ways but the most common one is including it as info in the transaction block.

[Stampery](https://www.ccn.com/blockchain-notarization-stampery/) gained notoriety because they partnered with microsoft to provide free notarization of documents on the blockchain. They even offered the notarization for the estonian e-residency application. But the service seems inoperational and so do all the other ones. 

Last year everyone was cheering that this will be one of the biggest blockchain applications allowing public trustless notarization. Now it's a big empty hall.

One of the miner's made what I thought was an interesting point: right now it is hard to attack the Ethereum network because you literally can't get your hands on enough GPUs or other hardware capable of doing it. By reducing block rewards, you make more hardware available to would be attackers by:

1) Forcing a bunch of miners to turn off their rigs, making their hashrate available ""for hire"" or making their GPUs available cheaply on eBay, etc...
2) Reducing the cost and availability of GPUs across the board, which is especially true with nVidia's new lineup of powerful GPUs releasing soon

Given this, it seems naive to think of a block reward reduction as linear to the hashrate reduction. It's more complicated than that, thanks to these second order effects.

To my disappointment, no one engaged him on this point. Maybe it's not actually big deal, but it seems at least worth discussing. I transcribed the exchange here, if you're interested:

Can anyone explain these claims?

1. Lightning nodes must keep track of the full history of channel states themselves. If they lose this, they are vulnerable to attacks and may lose coins.
2. Attackers may randomly lock up funds anywhere along the chain of channels for extended periods of time(many hours) at no cost to themselves.
3. Refilling every channel will be at least one onchain transaction, possibly two. If this happens twice a month, 1mb blocks + segwit will only be able to serve 4 million users. Some estimates are that Bitcoin already has 2-3 million users.
4. The Lightning Network will centralize towards banks having the most power in the network again. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYHFrf5ci\_g&amp;t=308s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYHFrf5ci_g&amp;t=308s)

How do exchange wallets really work? They have an entire wallet that contains a large percentage of all of their users funds, and they need to track every single one. I understand that they have internal databases that track amounts owed to users, but how do they set up the address generation system? I thought one wallet had a specific private or public key that corresponded to the same address every time.   
   
 How do exchanges provide an individual address to each user each time they deposit?    
    
How do they have the infrastructure to track those events on the blockchain that change a users balance?   
    
This is all interesting technology to me, and I don’t know much about it.

I'm /r/CryptoTechnology's newest mod and I'm here today to inform the masses about our new user flair bot. You may have already noticed it next to your name, so today I'm going to breakdown  what each attribute means.

#Flair attributes:
* Low comment karma - any user with less than 1,000 comment karma will have their comment karma in their flair
* New account - accounts that are less than 1 year old will have their account age listed
* Karma breakdown - this section will always include the karma for /r/CryptoTechnology along with the top few subs that the user has &gt; 500 karma or &lt; -10 karma 
* New to crypto - if a user has &lt; 15 posts and comments in crypto related subreddits, this flair will replace the karma breakdown
* Positive/Negative sentiment - this one's a bit complicated, so I'll explain more in the FAQ below

#FAQ:
* **Q: Positive/Negative sentiment? What does that even mean? Who are you to judge me? That's God's job!**
* A: I am your god now puny user. Submit or perish. Jk allow me to explain. The bot goes through (at most) a users last 1,000 comments and uses [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org) to preform sentiment analysis of the comments that are in crypto subs. Each comment returns a score which represents how positive/negative that comment is. These scores are aggregated and used to determine a users overall sentiment. If you have questions about how this is done, please refer to the source code which I will link at the bottom
* **Q: My karma stats don't seem right. What gives?**
* A: Due to limitations on Reddit's API, the bot can only fetch the last 1,000 comments and 1,000 posts from a users history. This means that users with over 1,000 posts or comments may see some inaccuracies in their karma breakdown. This does not affect a users total comment karma
* **Q: My flair says I'm negative, but I think I'm a pretty nice guy! How do I change it?**
* A: Sentiment analysis is far from an exact science and I'm no expert, so there are bound to be some cases of incorrectly flaired users. If you feel that you are one of those, please contact the mods who can manually review your account and add you to the whitelist. I specifically set up the bot to only flair extreme cases, so maybe some of you should just try to be a bit nicer instead. Your call...

##[Here is the source code for the bot if you are curious](https://github.com/disasterpiece9000/SentimentTool)

This paper is not block chain per se, it's about a new form of democracy that results in decentralising government to voters, keeping democracy in tact and in fact, improving it. It's called Issue Based Direct Democracy (IBDD)

The people who authored this article are developing a blockchain based voting application. which can implement the ideas of IBDD, at the moment it's just used for facilitating voting. Max was on the original Ethereum team and contributed on the scalability and smart contract side. Nathan is the CEO of SecureVote. The way the protocol works is quite novel. 

I'd also like to mention this is not a shill post, as the only way to gain exposure to this company is to invest in it. there are no tokens to buy unless you want to buy Ethereum (this will be explained)

The paper looks at our current democratic system, notes its flaws e.g. corruption. looks at the 3 main types of democracy and grabs the best ideas from all of them. Which gives us IDBB.

Since this is a cryptotechnology sub, ill divulge what i know about the blockchain implementation of the protocol. I was briefly involved with https://secure.vote/ in Sydney.

I was able to chat to Max and discuss the protocol. Privacy of mine was a huge concern with this protocol so I wanted to know more about how it worked e.g. homomorphic encryption, zeroproofs, ECDH etc. When I first heard about it, I figured it was just a dApp running on eth, neo etc. which highlighted other concerns. The implementation is nothing like that.

It's been a while since I discussed this with Max, and i do not have a white paper, it was him speaking to me, telling me how the protocol worked. Max is brilliant at what he does. The conversation was basically a white paper explained to me in an hour. its hard to remember everything from a conversation. He speaks fast and is very knowledgeable. 

**High level overview of how this blockchain protocol works**

- The protocol is made of a few components, the blockchain layer is called the Blockchain Agnostic Scalability Layer (BASL). The component which provides privacy of who votes for whom is called Copperfield (double oblivious shuffle for voting) which is the anonymisation algorithm. Here's a high level diagram: https://i.imgur.com/FmODTH0.png

- A high PoW chain is used to anchor off, in doing so, this protects their own blockchain. BTC was used in their  architecture/anchoring stress test /r/Bitcoin/comments/5xkvc1/psa_were_running_a_stress_test_of_our_blockchain/ - only about 6 months later swapped to Ethereum because it's a much nicer dev experience and confirmation times are more reasonable. I asked about casper as Eth is moving to PoS, he said he can just use another PoW chain.

- Block hashes downloaded from PoW chain (either stored in OP_RETURN with a tag on BTC, or in a smart contract on ETH) and then used to get blocks and sync the chain. It is then represented as data to facilitate voting. a DAG is spun up for each election, These DAGs form their own blockchain and the consensus algorithm is permissionless (public) so there's no centralisation needed.

- As for Copperfield, privacy is maintained with a protocol Inspired by coinshuffle, the idea of an oblivious shuffle was extended and Copperfield was created. The coin shuffle protocol can actually be baked right into BTC right now if the developers agreed on it: https://petsymposium.org/2014/papers/Ruffing.pdf. The paper should give some context with how Copperfield works along with this diagram posted above https://i.imgur.com/FmODTH0.png

- Depending on the type of vote/democracy a DAG might be thrown away if it's not needed for future consensus. Since all the block hashes of that DAG were committed to some public chain it can be archived and re-validated at any later point, but the data doesn't need to be actively maintained.

The stress test was 18k votes / sec (able to be audited live from a desktop pc) but they claim it could be bumped up to 150k votes / sec on a desktop (though that requires 10 mb/s downlink consistently)

The https://voteflux.org/ party in Australia is trying to promote the ideas of IBDD.

**I asked Max if he would like to do an AMA on this subreddit and he is interested. I certainly am, i hope you all are also.**

**EDIT:** If you have any questions for Max in his AMA, please list them here. it will give him some time to prepare. /u/Allways_Wrong already asked some good ones, so you're not always_wrong ;)

e.g.

- What happens if SecureVote the company goes bankrupt / disappears? Will the protocol live on? This concern was raised with ripple, but the ILP lives on without the company behind it.

- Another of course is fleshing out this protocol works, how are public keys assigned to voters

- i forgot to mention but voting is done in an app, or a website, so following on from the point above, there would need to be some know your voter (KYV) protocol? so that there is no fraud.

- How to prevent users voting twice e.g. identity fraud",NA,"98x7ku",NA,0,NA,"false",1536783255,"false","self","t5_9ptg6","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/98x7ku/redefining_democracy_by_max_kaye_nathan_spataro/",NA,"Enthusiast","false","","",0,0

Zk-STARKs is also theoretically secure against a quantum attack. However, in order to achieve transparent privacy along with quantum resistance,  ZK-STARKs’ proof sizes are estimated to be “a few hundred kilobytes” relative to zk-SNARKs’ 288 bytes. Vitalik argues that the tradeoff may be worthwhile “in the context of public blockchain applications where the need for trust minimization is high,” and most certainly will be “if elliptic curves break or quantum computers *do* come around.”.

So in short, zk-STARKs will be an improved version of zk-SNARKs in terms of trustless privacy and quantum resistance. The downside? Zk-STARKs is much more computationally expensive than its cousin.

Since I have limited time to manage it and play around and only a couple friends who might be interested to play with me in this kind of esoteric game, I think it would be beneficial to run something that doesn't *have* to be online constantly and where offlining can be managed easily and without a risk of forking. I understand bitcoin and many others can be managed like this as long as you know what you are doing, but they aren't made to be used that way.

I'm not very good with the technical side of blockchains (yet) but hopefully what I'm saying makes sense to someone.

What I'm asking here is whether anyone here knows of a blockchain project with open code that already has some of the features I mention.

**Features I 'm looking for:**

* Offline blockchain where, assuming consensus isn't a problem (since small scale and private) it is easy to spin up without having to manually check nodes for conflicting node data- essentially agreeing which block you go offline on and to then resume from that block.
* Requiring a transaction to generate a new address, either block reward or a transaction from previous adress. When an adress is exactly 0 upen block generation it will not be included in following blocks and any adress not included in blocks is always agreed to have a balance of 0.
* Node that can run under linux or windows where mining is done on cpu and mining is **always done by a full node**
* Securely private chain, meaning that either a consensus of nodes or of top holding adresses is required for a node to mine a block (might use dPOS??)
* Address follows same rule- either node requests to mine a block and generates a new address with reward, or some system where a pre-existing node generates the block and rewards the new user with the reward. How to ensure that the credentials for the new adress are never revealed to the friendly node might be tricky in this case though.
* An algo where you can *restrict* hashrate to stay within a target so that high performance nodes don't skew the difficulty / don't take all blocks. This way you could agree that for example target block time is 45 secs, target hashrate is 1Mh/s per node and that this resource calculation scales with number of active nodes, not individual node hashrate.

**Nice-to-have features**

* Easy to set up scripted online events- for example having all nodes offline and agreeing on one date where they will all online and allow 48 hours worth of block time for users to generate adresses, settle balances and so on- the possibility to write a script to handle irl handshake deals that you then execute on the online event.
* A basic rotating cryptographic scheme that allows a user to, without consulting documentatino or code, telling a new user what the ""phrase of the day"" should be for them to succesfully request to mine a block in order to generate an adress. It doesn't have to be extremely hard crypto, just enough that the scheme can't easily be inferred from just a few datapoints. Optimally it would be set up so that it increments after each use, so a malicious user couldn't generate many adresses in a bid to gain control but realistically you could also offset that risk with PoS so that in now way could the user gain a high enough balance to be a threat.
* dAPP capacity that is opt-in- for example if we decide we want to run a dAPP the high-performance nodes could opt in to run a turing machine whilst low-tier nodes could opt out.

I''m guessing I'll end up looking at Ethereum or one of its contenders but you never know, maybe there is a great project right under my nose that I've missed in all the noise.

#What’s Holding Bitcoin Back

Money should be a good store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account. There are a lot of barriers preventing bitcoin’s widespread use by the aforementioned criteria, let’s take a look and see how they might be solved.

##Lack of Understanding

Bitcoin is complicated and unfamiliar. This is a huge barrier to entry because people distrust what they don’t understand, and ease-of-use and simplicity is what usually sells a new technology. If you have read this series from the beginning though, you may now see some potential upsides to such a drastically different system than what we are used to. Many resisted smartphones for a time (and a few still do). The benefits have to outweigh the costs of adoption, so we may see niche cases being the early adopters (like citizens of Venezuela or remittances payments). Also, when a new complicated technology rolls around, it sometimes takes a generation before it becomes widespread; young people are particularly adept at adopting new tech.

##Volatility

The tendency of bitcoin’s price to change rapidly or unpredictably is what comprises volatility.

When you search for bitcoin you may find that most of the results you get (and the discussions happening on forums) are about it’s price. This is understandable, it has seen some crazy moves both up and down over the years facilitating the potential for huge gains (and huge losses). Still, over time the price certainly is increasing. Unless you bought in a single 2 month period in 2013, holding bitcoin for longer than 2 years at any point in its history would land you in a better position than when you started. And, when viewed on a logarithmic scale (used in long-term stock charts), the trend is quite clear:

([Bitcoin Price 2012-2018, Logarithmic Scale (bitcoincharts.com)](https://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#tgCzm1g10zm2g25zl))

There is a risk/reward to adopting new tech, and this is no exception. But, my goal is absolutely not to “sell” it to you as an investment by any means.

###This is not financial advice. We’re simply looking at the pros and cons of this space, and I encourage everyone to do their own research and come to their own conclusions. Never invest anything you aren’t prepared to lose.

This meteoric rising (and crashing) of the “price” (which, I’ll point out, might just as well be considered an exchange rate) understandably makes it pretty difficult to use bitcoin as a currency. If it moves a few percent in a day, and can move a few hundred percent in a month, purchasing a car or a house could cost you significantly more by the time your finished closing. That’s just not viable, and certainly not a good unit of account.

However, I see the volatility in price simply as growing pains. It is the market that dictates the price of bitcoin, quite literally, it’s traded like a stock. This is referred to as speculation (“the purchase of an asset with the hope that it will become more valuable at a future date”). Speculation happens between national currencies already, but they are generally stable in comparison so it’s not lucrative. People are unsure of how this whole bitcoin thing is going to play out. It’s not like anything we’ve ever seen, it’s difficult to understand (and use), and it’s not accepted at every corner store or online business. Many in the space are just here for a quick buck, and they sell it when the price rises to get back “real” money we are used to, that is “stable” in price against other currencies, and can predictably buy goods and services.

The way I see it, all of these will concerns diminish in time.

Though Amazon or Target don’t yet accept bitcoin, Microsoft and Overstock.com do. Some cities and towns across the world are embracing it a lot more than others. It’s not surprising to see San Francisco accommodating the new technology. But, other cities like Portsmouth in New Hampshire with numerous cafes and shops accepting bitcoin (and “Dash coin”) might surprise you. There are maps available to see where crypto-currencies are accepted at locations near you, and the amount of them are increasing, albeit slowly. It’s a bit of a chicken-and-egg situation, but that hasn’t stopped revolutions from happening before.

Consider when cars first came about, roads were dirt and mud which cars didn’t do well with. It took building massive infrastructure before cars could ever become mass-adopted, but we spent the time, money, and effort because we saw the potential advantages. It will be trivial for businesses to accept bitcoin compared with pouring hundreds of millions of dollars in asphalt to connect our world. Other parallels include train tracks, phone lines, electricity lines, communication satellites, etc. Each of these replaced or iterated on previous functional technologies, and required massive upfront costs before the benefits were available. It’s clear now that we made some good choices there but there were doubts at the time.

Despite some pretty major setbacks, bitcoin’s trend is up. Interest is growing and more businesses and individuals are actually using it. But due to the trading mentality, the uncertainty with regulations, uncertainty in the technology itself, uncertainty that the price will not drop, and other factors, emotion and greed encourages people to sell in flocks if the price climbs high enough.

Furthermore, right now with a large enough stack of money one can influence this market in drastic ways, and cries of manipulation of the price are not unfounded. So-called “whales” can buy and sell huge amounts of coins and the price can jump a bit each time. Coupled with uncertainty in the space, and so many “investors” trying to time the markets, we end up with a pretty volatile landscape where the price is not stable. My argument is that this is diminishing as it gains in popularity, and it is gaining value because its utility is growing (see the network effect”) and the utility itself is slowly becoming more apparent.

##Volatility is actually decreasing.

[Bitcoin Volatility Over Time(bitvol.info)](https://bitvol.info/index.html)

In the period from 2011 to 2014 bitcoin’s volatility often spikes into the 15% range. But from 2014 to the present, volatility has only just spiked above 7% twice, spending most of it’s time below 5%. Even the large boom and bust in price at the end of 2018 seems tame compared to the early years.

The trends show the price going up over time, and volatility going down. The more actual use the coin has (people saving and buying with bitcoin), the percentage of people entering the space to use it the way it was intended increases, the percentage of “stock traders” declines. And as more capital enters the space, the less influence whales have (because the current against which they swim is getting stronger). And as the price stabilizes, traders will become less interested.

There is a critical point where this becomes a negative feedback loop. I could be wrong, but the idea is at least founded in reality, and it would solve the unit of account issue if the price could stabilize to within a few percent per year.

Similarly, as a store of value, bitcoin becomes more viable in this scenario. This is coupled with the fact that although bitcoin is somewhat inflationary now as the supply is increasing (bitcoins are “discovered” as rewards for mined blocks), the amount of discovered coins are cut in half every few years. This “halving” is logarithmic, meaning eventually the amount of coins discovered is infinitesimally small, and total supply will asymptotically approach 21 million coins (the maximum supply that we will ever see).

This model of supply is actually meant to mimic gold because it’s a well-known store of value and monetary device throughout history (though it is not easily divisible, and not as portable as bitcoin). In both bitcoin and gold, mining is more fruitful in the beginning, and as we extract the low-hanging-fruit, mining requires greater effort and yields less return.

World population is increasing which leads to bitcoin becoming deflationary in the future if demand continues (the supply won’t increase beyond 21 million). And, I argue that it will become more valuable in time due to the network effect as bitcoin use becomes more widespread (the value of being able to exchange with more people anywhere, any time, and without permission from anyone).

This is a positive feedback loop, and shows how bitcoin is deflationary long-term. While deflation is generally considered negative by economists, the main reason is based around debt which isn’t possible in the same way with bitcoin because bitcoins cannot be created out of thin air like fiat currency.

The discussion of deflation vs inflation is an important one, and bitcoin’s monetary policy is an outlier compared with national currencies which are typically inflationary. The US dollar for example averaged 3% inflation since the year 1900. That means that over the last 100 years, a dollar has lost over 95% of its purchasing power. You could buy 95% more stuff with $1,000 last century, or, saving $1,000 from 100 years ago would buy you 95% less stuff at present. Put another way, purchasing power is cut in half after about 25 years, a concern for anyone retiring for over 20 years with a fixed retirement sum.

Some other national currencies have higher inflation rates, and there are numerous cases of inflationary spirals over the years. A few examples include Germany 1923, Hungary 1945, China 1947, Vietnam 1988, Peru 1990, Yugoslavia 1992, Zimbabwe 2008, and right now in Venezuela 2018. Entire countries of people have lost essentially all of their money, and it keeps happening over and over. A wise man would tell you it’s dangerous to say “it could never happen here”.

*UPDATE: Turkey is also now in financial crisis.
This is our money with which we hold and exchange value, our earnings, our savings, our livelihoods. Maybe it’s time we had, at least, another option outside of government control. An option that governments can’t destroy through mismanagement. A neutral option that ignores all borders, is open to everyone, and can be accessed anytime from anywhere.

##The Fear of “Hacks”

It’s a very real threat to have all your money stolen, if your bank was robbed you are protected by FDIC (in most cases only up to $100,000). The vast majority of coins that have been stolen have come from hackers attacking “exchanges” and getting away with millions. These exchanges are websites where you can trade bitcoin for other crypto-currencies (or “alt-coins”). You can also buy and sell bitcoin on them, and subsequently people end up storing a lot of coins on these exchanges, and the exchanges hold the “private keys” so they can execute trades.

Cryptographic private keys are analogous to a key that opens a door, or, a key that locks a message in a box before it is sent to the recipient. In our case the door opened allows you to sign your message and spend coins, and the message is your transaction on the bitcoin network. Anyone with your private keys can spend your coins. Exchanges are a honey pot of thousands of private keys that represent a lot of money. If a hacker can break into the exchange and steal the keys all at once, their work will pay off.

This is why any crypto guru will advise you not to store large amounts of coins on exchanges, and rather transfer them in your own wallets where you hold the private keys. The mantra is “your keys, your money; not your keys, NOT YOUR MONEY!” Of course your own computer can be hacked, but you are not as big a target as an exchange which may hold vast sums of money. There are also some pretty safe ways to store your coins if done right.

Centralized exchanges are a necessary evil for many people because they facilitate acquiring and trading coins easily. But decentralized exchanges are becoming more common because they allow you to trade while keeping your coins in your control at all times. They need some work and more users, but it’s a promising solution to this problem. Summarizing the above, the big hacks you read about are virtually eliminated if your keys are in your control and you keep them safe.

##Fees

Transaction fees are generally negligible in a bitcoin transaction, but in many ways “fees” are holding us back. Interestingly, this is a symptom of being in the very early days.

Firstly, there is a lot of work on “scaling” crypto-currencies (making fees even lower than they already are and increasing transaction speeds). This is just an engineering problem, and many people are working on solving it in many different ways. Other currencies like NANO or IOTA have different underlying tech and have zero fees and instantaneous transactions.

In fact, most fees people encounter aren’t fees from bitcoin transactions; instead, they get hit with fees when exchanging between national currencies and bitcoins. In order to electronically trade USD($), EUR(€), or YEN(¥) with bitcoin, we need to hook into the closed-off for-profit banking network and we need third-parties to do so (and they take their cut).

But even these fees could be avoided in time. For example, you can buy bitcoins with cash directly from a person (localbitoins.com). And, it might seem distant, but in the future you may end up receiving bitcoins as your salary, from a friend, or from accepting them in your place of business. Likewise you can spend your bitcoins directly to other bitcoin users. Getting coins directly eliminates all the exchanging and associated fees because once your money is on the bitcoin network, fees will be negligible (especially as these networks evolve).

##Usability

Right now it’s easier than ever to acquire some bitcoin. People can download “Coinbase” or “Square App” on their smartphone and purchase some using a credit card in a few minutes. Depending on which service you use and how much you want to buy, you may need to send a picture of your license for KYC regulations. However, as I mentioned above, there are risks to storing all your coins on exchanges, especially with large amounts. I always recommend transferring them to a wallet where you control the private keys.

But using wallets and storing private keys (and “seeds”) securely, is not as straightforward as we would like. This is a major factor holding back adoption, because if it’s not easy to use, people will consider it too much effort.

The next post in this series digs into wallets and storing your coins.

This causes the post to appear to me, but to everyone else its been deleted. Now, why would they undertake such an underhanded tactic?

**End EDIT**


There's a lot of talk about anonymity and privacy as it relates to blockchains. Recently a report surfaced mentioning that cryptos are basically bad news for criminals: 
https://dailyhodl.com/2018/09/16/bitcoin-is-actually-a-money-laundering-tracking-device-that-catches-criminals-report/

**TL;DR is at the bottom**

Why? Because they're easy to track. Once they've got a single piece of identifying info that's linked to an address (say that coinbase transfer to an exchange) then all transactions are linkable to that id. But, privacy coins are different because they obscure this history (or in some cases 'delete' it all together).  However, it can be a little difficult to decide which privacy coin offers the best privacy, along with the best combination of fees, security and usability. 

So with no further ado, here is your simple guide to evaluating privacy coins! Like daily tx throughput is a key metric of btc/blockchain adoption and usage, privacy coins have their own 'key metric' to determine their ability to hide your tx history: the size of their anonymity set. This is basically the number of other people with which your transaction is plausibly 'mixed' so at to sever the link between your address and that coin. The greater this number is, the more difficult it is to associate a coin with your address, thus making it more private. 

To make this easier to understand, it helps to know the following:
**All privacy coins do the same thing, just in vastly different ways.** What is that thing?
Obscuring/removing your linkage to a coin by mixing it with a similar coin denomination from another wallet. Monero is a slight exception to this, since transaction amounts are hidden in the blockchain as well, so there's no need for denominations. Also, your coin is mixed with fake coins that aren't real, instead of coins from other wallets, but no one can tell that from the blockchain so it works.

##PIVX
In PIVX, for example, ~10-20% of all pivx held in wallets is 'gathered' by the accumulator (note it never leaves your control) in a central pool of zpiv using standard denominations like 10 zpiv, 1zpiv, .1zpiv etc. This is a configurable setting in the wallet so some may wish to turn it on/off at their discretion, but recent research has shown that 24% of all PIVX held in wallets is private/zpiv, see u/turtleflax's comment below. 

After all of that, by using a zero-knowledge proof which cryptographically proves you owned whatever zpiv was minted from your wallet without any linking information to you, zpiv is 'sent' to your wallet and shows up with no transaction history. So the anonymity set is ~~10%~~, ~24% nowadays, of all PIVX held in wallets, which is obviously huge.

##ZCoin
ZCoin and PIVX uses the same strategy as both implement the ZeroCoin protocol, which itself is just a specification, PIVX and ZCoin are implementations *of* that spec. Same idea with the denominations. PIVX's implementation is much more advanced however. ZCoin doesn't have an accumulator or anything and its privacy is optional. 

However, its not possible to break a Zerocoin/ZCoin/PIVX transaction because there is nothing to break. It would be like trying to guess someone's password just by them logging in and proving they know their password and it works. That doesn't give you any information that would help. Furthermore, the total anonymity set is around 6.5% of the total supply which puts it comfortably in the same region as PIVX.

##ZCash
ZCash is an implementation of the ZeroCash protocol which is an improvement on the ZeroCoin protocol. The cool thing about ZCash is that it also hides the amount of the transaction. ZCash's privacy is optional and the blockchain is split between t-addresses and z-addresses. t-addrs are transparent and contain visible balances just like Bitcoin, which ZCash is a software fork of. z-addrs are shielded. ZCash appears to have two kinds of shielded transactions (shielded and fully shielded). 

I'm not sure of the difference between them, but according to this handy block explorer: https://explorer.zcha.in/statistics/usage, shielded txs are far more prevalent than fully shielded ones. The difference between them may be that fully shielded txs are transactions between two z-addrs while a tx that is 'just shielded' may be one between a z-addr and a t-addr and possibly a t-addr and a z-addr, but again, I'm not sure.

The developers claim that the anonymity set is very large in comparison to coins like Dash, and since it is based on the ZeroCoin protocol like PIVX and ZCoin, it is reasonable to assume its anon set is similarly large and based on a proportion of the supply, though where among the three it stands is of course up for debate/verification. Perhaps as large as the shielded value colume for any time period, also note that is a lower bound, so for the past month: 394989 ZEC would be the total shielded ZEC, so this seems a reasonable lower-bound on the Anon-set. Its hard to Tell between this and PIVX which is larger.

##Dash
In Dash, it depends on how many rounds you mix. Each coin is once again broken down into standard denominations like 10, 1, .1 .01 Dash. Each round involves a minimum of three different wallets. So take the number of participants and raise it to the rounds you mix-th power, and that is your minimum anonymity set. So mixing four rounds gives you a minimum anonymity set of (3 participants)4 rounds = 81. Eight rounds gives you a min set of 38 = 6,561.

 Could be more if more than three wallets were involved in any single mix, which is possible.
However, it could be less if the same participants are used per round, which is unlikely. This is still a HUGE anonymity set; however, its probably at least an order of magnitude less than PIVX and ZCoin unless you were to get 4-5 wallets mixing per round. Still, even 81 could be rightly considered overkill, especially since considering the nature of privateSend and the random separation between 'minting' and spending makes Dash immune to timing analysis attacks. The determination of which coin to use will come down to your anonymity needs. How private do you need to be?

##Monero
In Monero, the anonymity set is the number of mixins used at the time of your transaction. Which is currently 7. Monero originally had optional privacy where the min mixin was 0 and those transactions were transparent like btc's. However, having these 0 mixin transactions together with the higher mixin transactions allowed for higher ones to be deanoned, that and 3 forms of timing analysis attacks forced the min mixin to be raised to 3, then 5 and now 7. 

#TL;DR

#So in short, if you want to rank privacy coins by their anon-set size (which is the only thing that matters) the list is as follows:

##1. **ZeroCoin and ZeroCash implementations: PIVX, ZCoin, ZCash**
##2. **Dash**
##3. **Monero**

Note: Each tier represents a range of at least &gt;1 order of magnitude greater anonymity set. So ZCoin, ZCash and PIVX are all grouped together, even though PIVX may have an anon-set 10-50x greater than ZCash or ZCoin (just an example, not a real figure), all three of them are still going to have anon sets 1-4 orders of magnitude greater than Dash, and like 6-7 greater than Monero. Monero's default min mixin is 7 and the max definable in the gui wallet IIRC is 26. Be aware however that using higher, rarer ring sizes causes your transaction to stick out.

Due to the nature of how they are selected, there are wide ranges for the anon sets of these coins, except for monero. But especially so for that of Dash, which may on occasion cross into the grey zone between numbers 1 and 2 due to uncertainty around the number of wallets participating, and the fact that an attacker will never know how many rounds a tx is going through. 

And because Dash doesn't rely on encryption for its privacy, if you don't catch/trace the transaction when its happening, i.e. by buying up 70% or more of the masternodes, you can never deanon it. If you use encryption, especially for the entire blockchain, you paint a large target on your blockchain. If your encryption is ever broken, then all past transactions will be deanoned at once, so not good. This is a benefit of steganography over some encryption based privacy schemes.

i see this as a downside for its use in btc long term, or do i not understand how the lighting network operates?

The team here is currently talking behind-the-scenes on some changes on how we handle moderation, new moderators, filters, content quality, and our core values. With that said, we'd like to know a few things from the community in order to better direct ourselves to the future policies this subreddit will start enforcing.

In a nutshell, we want to provide quality content revolving around technical discussions for cryptocurrency / blockchain technology. We want to be the place where folks can come to avoid shilling, spam, hodling, pricing, predictions, recommendations, fomo-ing, and so on. The only content you should see here is users participating in pure technical discussions revolving around coins and their real-world use, something you simply can't find anywhere else.

A vision like this requires intense scrutiny and moderation, so this means it might take a while for us to figure out how we can achieve these goals properly, for example, creating a structure that can help us decide approvals/removals (is this person shilling or is he genuinely trying to have a technical and productive conversation revolving x coin?), ect.

**We'd love to get your feedback:**

1. Why did you subscribe to us?
2. What did you expect to see?
3. What did you end up seeing?
4. What can we do better?
5. Any other comments for us?

Thank you so much for your participation, if any.

Wall Street’s adoption of Bitcoin could change Bitcoin immensely though—and depending on who you ask, perhaps not for the better.

For those who would like to see Bitcoin achieve more mainstream adoption, this is a huge development. Besides NYSE, Intercontinental Exchange owns [more than 20](https://www.theice.com/publicdocs/ICE_at_a_glance.pdf) (PDF) exchanges, market services, and clearing houses. It is, to put it mildly, very influential in the world of finance. Its move into Bitcoin will likely entice institutional investors—hedge funds, family offices, sovereign wealth funds, and other entities looking to invest large sums of money—to follow. Many of these firms have been interested in investing in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but have been hesitant due to the lack of conventional market infrastructure.

There may be reason for Bitcoin boosters to be concerned, however. According to [Caitlin Long](https://caitlin-long.com/about/), a longtime Wall Street veteran turned Bitcoin aficionado, the financial industry’s embrace could have negative repercussions, particularly if Wall Street firms choose to treat the currency like they do most conventional assets. The potential problems arise from the fact that Bitcoin and Wall Street operate based on “fundamentally different systems” for handling assets, says Long, who spent 22 years working for various Wall Street firms and most recently served as chairman and president of Symbiont, an enterprise blockchain company.

The difference boils down to two key aspects. First, whereas Bitcoin’s assets (bitcoins) are directly owned and controlled by individual holders of their corresponding cryptographic keys, in most cases if you buy a stock or other convention asset, you don’t own it—a centralized institution like an exchange, a [custodian](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/custodian.asp), or a [clearing house](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/clearinghouse.asp) does. What you actually “own” is an IOU from your broker or another financial institution.

Second, whereas Bitcoin’s blockchain is engineered to prevent more than one person from owning a single asset, Wall Street firms routinely use their clients’ assets to back their own transactions and trades, for example by using them as collateral in order to borrow from another firm. This type of practice is “standard operating procedure” on Wall Street, says Long, who adds that as a result, financial markets systematically “create more claims to an underlying asset than there are underlying assets.” The ledgers used to track these claims can get out of sync—shareholders in Dole Foods, for example, once went to claim their rewards after a successful class-action lawsuit against the company and found [they owned 33 percent more shares than there were actual shares](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-02-17/dole-food-had-too-many-shares).

This kind of situation is “antithetical” to Bitcoin, [argues](https://www.forbes.com/sites/caitlinlong/2018/08/13/the-r-and-c-words-enter-the-vocabulary-of-bitcoin-enthusiasts/) Long, since it would offset the currency’s algorithmically-enforced scarcity. (New bitcoins are created at a controlled rate, via the system’s [resource-intensive mining process](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610833/explainer-what-is-a-blockchain/), and the total supply will never exceed just over 21 million.) That could suppress its price, and it’s why Long is convinced that if Wall Street firms choose to treat Bitcoin as “just another asset they can trade” using their existing models for doing business, they’ll be making a big mistake.",NA,"9dpg8t",NA,0,NA,"false",1540087332,"false","self","t5_9ptg6",NA,"","","false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/9dpg8t/how_wall_streets_embrace_could_undermine_bitcoin/",NA,"Crypto God | MIOTA | CC | CT","false","","",0,1

* What is the main innovation of Babble consensus mechanism?

Babble combines the advantages of an asynchronous DAG protocol with the benefits of a blockchain's linear data structure. The former makes it possible to achieve low latency, high throughput, asynchronous, and leaderless consensus. The latter enables Babble-powered blockchains to interface seamlessly with any application and to communicate with other blockchains via Inter-Blockchain Communication protocols.

&amp;#x200B;

* How is Babble related to Hashgraph?

Hashgraph is a form of Directed Acyclic Graph that cryptographically records the history of gossip. Gossip protocol is in the foundation of Babble. However, Babble takes this data structure one step further and maps ordered transactions into a blockchain format.

&amp;#x200B;

* What are the key advantages of Babble consensus?

Key advantages of Babble consensus are speed, throughput, fault-tolerance, absence of leaders, and pluggability.

&amp;#x200B;

imo dai is the best stablecoin on paper because it uses on-chain collateral in a DAO, which is decentralized and solves the transparency issues people have with tether. but i don't love that it can be destablized for reasons outside of its control when eth randomly goes to shit like it does today. 

i think that privacy is really important for cryptocurrencies as well, because privacy in this world just gets you to where normal cash is in the sense that people can't randomly snoop around in my finances if they have my wallet address. are there any private, decentralized stablecoin projects around? this is pretty much the holy grail of cryptocurrency to me. 

i was prompted to make this post after finding a project that claims to do this, but it hasn't even icod yet and i don't want to be a shill so just asking if there's anything else out there.

This is the idea: there are two classes of user: (i) transactor, and (ii) relayer. A relayer takes a set of operations from transactors, and combines them all into a transaction and makes a ZK-SNARK to prove the validity, and publishes the ZK-SNARK and the transaction data in a highly compressed form to the blockchain. A relayer gets rewarded for this by transaction fees from transactors.

(The nuts and bolts are further discussed in [this thread](https://ethresear.ch/t/on-chain-scaling-to-potentially-500-tx-sec-through-mass-tx-validation/3477))

The downside of this approach is the big computational cost that will burden the relayers. State-of-the-art SNARK/STARK algorithms are still too computationally expensive at the moment, so more research needs to be done in this area. But at least that's a relatively new and exciting approach worth looking into.",NA,"9k32pf",NA,0,NA,"false",1540194738,"false","self","t5_9ptg6",NA,"","noflair","false","true",NA,"/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/9k32pf/ethresearch_onchain_scaling_to_potentially_500/",NA,"Student","false","","",0,0
