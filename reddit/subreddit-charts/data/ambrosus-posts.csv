I will support in whatever way I can, but I would like to encourage the team to seriously consider the following message:

I fear for your personal and physical safety. A lot of the current intermediaries in the food supply chain stand to lose out from this technology. The world is an ugly place, and if someone's wealth is threatened, they will want to protect it by all means necessary. 

I am in no way threatening the team at all. I am a family-loving man and have no wealth to speak of to protect, especially in the food industry. I just hope you spend time to think about and implement some security measures for yourself instead of just thinking about the security of your network/product.

[VERY LONG]","Hey all. I want to preface this by saying I am a crypto investor and Ambrosus is now my 2nd largest portfolio holding (behind Ethereum). My full time job is research/analysis (I do not do this for anyone else or a wage; my own portfolio is my skin in the game and yes this keeps me plenty sharp &amp; motivated). I’ve been doing this for quite awhile since when I first bought BTC back in very early 2013, and then later in early 2016 became one of those early people who got deeply into Ethereum before it rocketed mid 2017. My investment philosophy is deeply rooted in fundamentals &amp; not hype/marketing/coin-of-the-week with quippy one-liners &amp; Facebook ads. You won’t see me discussing short-term price movement, technical analysis, FOMO/FUD, or any of that in this post. It’s long because, to be frank, the scope and vision of Ambrosus is very ambitious. Yes, this takes time to read but I hope you’ll find it educational as you read along.


**I wanted to make this post for two reasons: 1) Begin to walk you partly through my analysis &amp; thoughts on why this is now my 2nd core holding 2) For educational/awareness purposes in order to help other people in this community further understand why Ambrosus’ vision is so unique &amp; why I believe it has a bright future.**


This post will be quite long and comprehensive. The second &amp; possibly third part which I’ll write in the next few weeks will dive deeply into competition, why Amber being (or not being) on exchanges doesn’t really matter as much as you think right now, price discovery thesis, Ambrosus business development/key partnerships moving forward, KYC/regulatory compliance in Switzerland, why this project above all others needs investment patience and why I believe the wait will be worth it, and of course anything else that people are curious to hear about based on feedback from this post.


I put a lot of time into this - if it makes sense to you I hope you’ll follow through on some of the links &amp; relevant research you find interesting and please feel free to use parts/all of it as your own or leave comments or questions if I might have made something unclear. If you’d like me to expand on anything please let me know &amp; I can likely go into much more technical or business detail. This is my way of giving back to the Ambrosus community - I have no hidden motives other than once again plainly stating and making it clear to all readers that yes, I bought a bunch of Amber and plan to hold it. If you find it valuable the best thing you can do is share it with others who might also share an interest in this project. I once again want to state this analysis was based on having done over 60+ hours of research on Ambrosus (as well as its closest substitutes) before making any financial decisions with my own Ether. It will begin to tell the story of Ambrosus and I’ve broken it up into 4 main parts to begin. So let’s get started:


**Due diligence 101:**

**Q1)** What is the problem they’re trying to solve?

**Q2)** Is the blockchain even a good solution to solve these issues?

**Q3)** What is Ambrosus doing that is so unique to tackling this problem?

**Q4)** Is this a team likely to make it happen?



**Question 1) What is the problem they’re trying to solve?**


At a high level overview, Ambrosus will be the first company to tell the complete story of Food/Pharmaceuticals as they go from farm to fork or as they’re made from the lab to the time the medicine is consumed. How this story unfolds can be called supply chain logistics and management. 

Let’s first start with why Ambrosus wanting to do this even matters. To answer that we need to know why current supply chain solutions/logistics fall short and whether Ambrosus has a solution to these shortcomings. Right now current supply-chain solutions are ultimately built on a foundation of “trust.” I use the word “trust” loosely because generally speaking there is absolutely no way to verify what it is they’re doing unless you take the supplier's word as gospel. Plainly stated: supply-chain solutions are currently fragmented, opaque, and suffer from multiple places of friction and corruption. 

As an end consumer we are supposed to trust what businesses &amp; suppliers say because they present us with information. When they say they’ve done what they’re supposed to do, we put whatever we just bought in our mouths and hope for the best. In a 1st world country this might translate to food poisoning (a $55B problem in America: http://fortune.com/food-contamination/)  or maybe some medicine that is missing ingredients or has been transported in poor conditions that perhaps if you’re lucky won’t really do much to you. However, in 3rd world countries this affects millions of people daily and for hundreds of thousands of people this can lead to death (source: http://www.bbc.com/news/business-37470667). Once again, it may depend where you may live &amp; products you consume, but it’s a global issue affecting many.

And let’s make sure we understand this: supply-chains logistics are very complex; many stakeholders along the way interact with a product/material. Even if 99% of them are well-intentioned, all you need is one morally corrupt stakeholder to cheat the current system intentionally or inadvertently (which is quite easy and commonplace). This is shown due to fraudulent products (in medicine) alone being a $200B dollar industry and climbing. source: https://www.strategyand.pwc.com/reports/counterfeit-pharmaceuticals. 

A brief bit about me: I live in Vancouver Canada (1st world country, liberal leaning culture) and there is a huge market of unmet demand for food transparency. Even if you personally don’t care whether something is *‘organic’* or what ingredients are in what you’re eating, I promise you there are people/businesses/governments who do. 8 in 10 people want a better understanding of where their food is coming from (source: https://www.newfoodmagazine.com/news/42541/8-10-consumers-labelling/ &amp; you better believe big businesses are noticing this trend and paying attention to what Ambrosus is doing. 

**Very relevant:** Angel (CEO of Ambrosus) mentioned in the Ambrosus discord channel that 50+ businesses have already approached them with interest. That’s proof there is a *‘problem’* and these businesses see Ambrosus’ vision as a viable solution. Make sure you understand that these business reached out to Ambrosus and not the other way around. This isn’t even hyped, but it goes without saying that it’s extremely promising when businesses seek out Ambrosus as a solution. They’re working on those relationships behind the scenes now, but more on that in another post. The point I am making is that the *‘real world’* is noticing. Collectively, these use cases are easily $1T+ industries Ambrosus is looking to disrupt. 


**Question 2) Is the blockchain even a good solution to solve these issues?**


Before I ever part with my Ether the first thing I look for with an ICO is: Does this *‘problem’* they’re solving actually need a blockchain? (In other words: Is this ICO a solution looking for a problem/money grab or an legitimate usage case) For blockchain -&gt; supply chain -&gt; Ambrosus the answer is unequivocally yes. Listen to minute 52-53:30 here https://vimeo.com/232316774 where Vitalik describes Ambrosus’ business model (To be clear: he doesn’t use the word Ambrosus in his description, but I’m betting he clearly knows of Ambrosus because he described its vision perfectly, so much so that it can’t just be a coincidence). What he says:
 

*(….and in the end ideally you could have the consumer be able to check on their smartphone through an app the whole [complex] supply chain history and ensure its authenticity every step of the way)* 


How cool is that??  Because that right there is exactly what Ambrosus is doing. Bingo! (PS - Ambrosus, be sure to introduce yourself to Vitalik whenever you ever get a chance!)

So let’s briefly recap and elaborate a bit more on what the current supply-chain solutions are and why they’re falling short. Supply chains &amp; logistics greatly vary industry to industry. But generally speaking for high-value goods, the current ‘best’ solutions are RFID tags. RFID tags *‘track’* a product. You know how your phone can show you via GPS where you’ve been? Think of NFC/RFID tags like that. Now why isn’t this a good-enough solution? For some products it very well may be, but for many others (food/pharmacy amongst others) we can easily say just because you can track a crate that doesn’t actually tell you what actually has happened to that crate from point A-&gt;B. Think about it: Did someone in the supply chain switch the ingredients for lesser quality to save on costs? Were they stored properly to industry standards? RFID is just *‘one’* piece of the story told in supply chains and once you understand that you can begin to understand how it is gameable by the current system. It can be a necessary part of the story, but it’s never the complete story. That’s why I said earlier it’s based on *‘trust’*. Gee, I hope this Olive Oil I just bought from my boutique grocery store in North America isn’t among the 70% of them that are basically a $26 dollar bottle of Canola oil. source: https://ambrosus.com/assets/Ambrosus-Olive-A4-v4.pdf  This post will already be very long, but to keep it from being even longer if you’re still not convinced yet just spend 10 minutes reading about Pharmaceutical industries here https://ambrosus.com/assets/Ambrosus-Pharmacy-v2.pdf and I promise it’ll help you understand how dysfunctional the status quo is and how ripe it is for disruption.

I could go on, but one of the biggest takeaways is how this problem needs to be solved. It can only be solved through an end-to-end solution that captures the full supply chain and holds it accountable, otherwise it’s pretty much useless (due to now being gameable &amp; thus removing any future data integrity): https://www.cips.org/supply-management/news/2017/august/investigators-hired-as-fake-food-incidents-rise-in-china/ with relevant quotes of *“In most food supply chains, there is one or more unreliable data providers,”* he said. *“This means blockchain is likely useless for protecting against food fraud unless every piece of data is scrutinised to be accurate.”*  - (Mitchell Weinberg founder of Global Base Food Supply Chain Investigator Inscatech speaking about skepticism on blockchain solutions to uncover food fraud). **I cannot stress enough that Ambrosus is the only blockchain/start-up that seems to really understand this and has built in solutions in their vision and roadmap to address these very concerns.**


**Question 3) What is Ambrosus doing that is so unique to solving this problem?**


Simply, their approach and introduction of disruptive technology. It’s brilliant. Once again remember supply chains logistics as being extremely finicky &amp; industry dependent. Each industry/corporation/business, whether it’s Pharmacy, Baby food, Olive Oil, have their current approaches &amp; needs will all be different depending on a variety of different factors, such as frequency of sensor readings, pH levels, level of light, temperature, RFID/NFC requirements, etc.

So how do you go about solving all these different needs? You can try to make tailored solutions to niche industries from the ground-up (briefly the problem with this approach is that it's extremely time consuming, expensive &amp; not scalable and only a single usage case that is rigid for each supply chain) or you could take the Ambrosus approach and design a protocol approach through building up an entire ecosystem. If you want, here is the technical post on expanding on the ecosystem concept: https://blog.ambrosus.com/ambrosus-roadmap-whats-next-by-vlad-trifa-eb3acc88a759 or scan page 7-9 here https://ambrosus.com/assets/Ambrosus-Vision-Paper-V.2.3.2-EN.pdf  for what the 6 core technologies are in this ecosystem. In my own words I’ll explain this because it’s where I get really excited and it seems most people have fallen short on understanding why Ambrosus is truly so much different than anything on the market or currently being built. 

To begin, great examples of protocol tokens are 0x and Ether. Think of them as a foundation layer where software implementations can then be easily built on top of.  Ambrosus is also a foundational protocol layer that allows related software to be easily built on top of it. This allows industries to easily create and integrate their specific supply chain solutions on the Ambrosus architecture. Hard to wrap your head around? Think of Ambrosus as the Ethereum network and AMB as ETH (the gas that runs these *‘Dapps’*. The *‘Dapps’* in this example will be the supply chain solutions for each industry/business/corporation, etc).

Let’s make sure we clearly understand from a business perspective why it’s so much better to build your supply chain solution on Ambrosus rather than somewhere else. The brief business case for why a corporation would want to build on Ambrosus is you’ll save money (overhead), reduce friction, will have more data than you’ve ever had before to analyze and improve logistics further (and stored for cheaply on Ambrosus private blockchain which will be tied to Ethereum public chain), can leverage existing synergies with others in this ecosystem (network effect - much like 0x and Ether), will integrate with existing IT solutions and infrastructures &amp; tested smart contracts to streamline your processes. You’d also have the possibility of quickly leapfrogging your competitors and become an industry leader in your field for supply chain transparency. The cherry on top is of course that it’s extremely good press for said company.

To be fair, let’s pretend you wanted to build your own ecosystem and cut out Ambrosus? Well you’d first have to build a technology stack similar to Ambrosus, so step 1 go hire some developers &amp; engineers. Then you’ll need to create a private blockchain that is scalable to your exact needs so you’ll need some blockchain developers. Then you’ll need to do groundbreaking innovative R&amp;D into hardware sensors much like Stephan Meyer in the first half of this article is doing (https://blog.ambrosus.com/progress-report-15-oct-17-sensors-new-hires-activities-future-events-86984665a8d9) so you’ll need more scientists/PhD’s in relevant fields of expertise. Then you’ll likely need to create a test lab to run these experiments before scaling it (meaning you’ll need a CTO &amp; more guys with lab coats). You’d have to code and create smart contracts that all properly facilitate the recording of data along the supply chain. Then the CTO would have to explain to the CEO why they’re taking this huge unproven risk &amp; how it’s going to integrate perfectly first try with their existing solutions. Haha yeah, I know…that CTO clearly has ambition.

**Even after all that it also doesn’t solve the biggest problem - trust.** Why? Back to what Vitalik said and why the blockchain is so perfect for this usage case. Who’s watching the watcher? You employ your own solution, no one can see whether you’re actually meeting industry standards. It could all work and you could have all the information and still game the system because you’re the only one who can check-up on it. Let’s once again play devils advocate: What happens when you mess up your medical delivery during the shipment because it was exposed to excess heat? Well who’s going to know except the corporation who holds all the power in a centralized manner &amp; hides this data from those who want to see it?

Ambrosus is ungameable and meets this stringent criteria. Any solution that doesn’t is incomplete and worthless (comparatively speaking) as we can understand from part two. In another post I’ll do a competitor analysis, but I can tell you right now they’re the only company whose vision &amp; scope is looking to tell the *complete* story from farm-to-fork and lab to the time medicine is consumed and that’s why what they are doing is so unique. The Amber token can be tied to the incorruptible hardware sensors and records real time data that is securely uploaded on an immutable blockchain. This private blockchain that they’re building will connect to the Ethereum blockchain. Those parties who need to see certain information will be to do so, but what this solution ultimately entails is no one corrupt stakeholder is above the ecosystem and will ever be able to re-write history or tamper/trick the sensors even if they tried their hardest.

For us as an end-consumer, the vision is exactly what Vitalik described. You look at your smartphone and you can see the full digital story of this product/material you’re buying. This offers a elegant and superior solution for all stakeholders, especially end-consumers who want to know it’s immutable &amp; trustworthy.


**So briefly to recap this structure what is it they’re doing?**


**1.)**  They’re creating new R&amp;D into hardware sensors that expand scope of any existing solutions.

**2.)**  They’re building a foundational layer (protocol) layer that makes enterprise solutions easy to build on top of (scalable, multi-usage cases in the future)

**3.)**  They’re building an R&amp;D lab for food product testing

**4.)**  They’re creating a private blockchain to store data uploaded from the sensors

**5.)**  Building smart contracts to streamline payments, quality control (supply chain monitoring) that will all talk to each other to remove friction on supply chain logistics

**6.)**  Building developer tools for supply chain management &amp; a P2P marketplace

**7.)**  More key hires &amp; expansion of team

**8.)**  Forging new strategic partnerships with blockchain/software/IoT businesses that will allow them to integrate their sensors into existing hardware solutions to build scalable solutions quicker

**9.)**  Forging new business relationships behind the scenes with corporations to help onboard them


**What is it they’re not doing?**


**1.)**  Wasting money marketing towards the crypto community to build awareness (instead they’re putting these resources into enterprise &amp; corporate partnerships)

**2.)**  Driving consumer awareness for mass adoption (at this point - it’s still too early)

**3.)**  Announcing behind-the-scenes discussions for quick pumps &amp; price speculation


*’What is it they’re doing?’* can be stated as building a robust, proper ecosystem. I call this planting seeds for the harvest - much like Ethereum did all through 2016 before it exploded in popularity mid 2017. These things matter so much more than *’What is it they’re not doing?’* which is just white noise &amp; a waste of time from a long-term business strategy perspective (at this stage - especially #2, but when they’re ready they will do this). I care about the fundamental growth in this ecosystem, not the price of Amber tomorrow, if you’ve read this far you’re probably like me and know this is ultimately what matters when measured in months/years. If you want more details on 1-9 click here: https://blog.ambrosus.com/ambrosus-progress-report-24-oct-2017-4b71850c082


**Question 4) Is this a team likely to make it happen?**


Start with the *‘About Me’* of each core member. Check their LinkedIn, Github, etc and see how they read here: https://ambrosus.com/#team

That’s pretty lazy research on my end if all I did was plug a link. So let’s go deeper.


**Matthew** was the one of the main developers behind Storj and is a great hire. I’ve spoken with him on some developer issues and he’s quite logical and has well-thought out positions including making an extremely strong token usage case for Amber being the heartbeat of this project. I wish I could find his exact words (they’re buried deep in the Discord channel), but I remember being very satisfied about him taking the time to explain thoroughly the Amber token utility and how it will fully capture the transfer of value functions within the Ambrosus ecosystem as applications are being built on top of the protocol layer.


 **Vlad** penned this blog post here: https://blog.ambrosus.com/ambrosus-roadmap-whats-next-by-vlad-trifa-eb3acc88a759 and you can see how deeply he understands this field. He’s dropped into Discord, answered questions on the fly and my impression of him is he understands the hurdles &amp; realities that must be overcome for mass adoption down the road. I get the feeling he undersells and over delivers (which in my personal opinion I really like). 


I haven’t spoken with **Dr Joseph Wang** yet so I can’t comment beyond his biography, but this article reads well about his expertise/resume: https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/former-jp-morgan-vp-dr-joseph-chen-yu-wang-joins-ambrosus/


Next up I wanted to touch upon **Oliver Bussmann**, an advisor to Ambrosus. What people may not also realize is that Oliver is a boss in the crypto world. This is extremely underrated and it seems quite overlooked. Of note, he’s also a top advisor to IOTA.


The other advisor I wanted to touch upon is **Parity Technologies (and by default Gavin Wood)**. Parity Technologies is the company founded by Gavin Wood and Jutta Steiner. Their whole team is the core technology partner to Ambrosus. From my understanding of asking in chat, they’ve already helped hash out, in a collaborative process with the Ambrosus team, some of the questions regarding underlying protocol development and I believe they will continue to have face-to-face future meetings. My own speculation is the true value of this partnership is in the bouncing of ideas from all of Parity Technologies they collaborate on as Ambrosus continues to scale and grow its ecosystem. If you’re curious, you can see Ambrosus Github, where you can see Gavin’s commits to the Token Generation Event for Ambrosus page here: https://github.com/ambrosus/tge-contract/graphs/contributors and from his twitter account an endorsement of their partnership here: 
https://twitter.com/gavofyork/status/906555627526410240 


Now for the CEO, **Angel**. I suggest you start by reading about the CEO here: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/unwanted-in-russia-excluded-from-cambridge-2309511.html

The bottom line is this guy is a fighter, who above all else gets shit done. I could talk about why he strategically turned down over $30M of money during the ICO (and why as an Amber holder in a later post this makes very good sense strategically once I understood the bigger vision) but that is a digression from the main points I want to speak of, which is that I’m pretty sure his spirit animal is a honey badger. What I can definitively tell you is through these last few months I’ve spoken to Angel more than a few times on Discord. He doesn’t bullshit you by only telling you what you want to hear. He’s extremely determined, but pragmatic at the same time and when I’ve pressed him on certain issues he’s come back at me sometimes with answers that I wasn’t hoping to get, but I can follow his sound logic/business acumen and respect why he sees it differently. I’ve been a business owner myself and have talked with many project leads/CEOs (for research/analysis) and I haven’t been more impressed by anyone else. He’s struck me as someone who has integrity and a long-term vision &amp; knows to focus his time and effort on building true fundamentals and not glittery stuff that doesn’t move the long-term needle. Many times there were questions I wanted answers to and I’d see him replying 3am his time (4pm my time).  Or here he is penning this blog post here https://blog.ambrosus.com/ambrosus-progress-report-24-oct-2017-4b71850c082 at 4:01am Swiss time when it seems most CEO’s would be out popping bottles after raising ~$35M. You don’t win medals for doing stuff like that, but you know what that tells me? He’s out there hustling like any good honey badger would and working towards making this vision a reality. 

The biggest compliment I can give him, after having spoken with him on Discord &amp; email and hearing his level of detail on how he plans to build Ambrosus and his approach to solving problems, is that I’ll back his project with my own money. I’m now a professional investor, having invested in cryptos for ~4+ years now and I’m of a mindset where I need a very good reason to part with my Ether.  I look for any small reason to pass on projects nowadays. I genuinely believe in the roadmap he’s laid out and the team’s ability to execute it and hit their deliverables - and in turn plant the seeds for an extremely ripe harvest. So let's end Part 1 of why Ambrosus is my second core holding here. If you read this all, thanks and much appreciated.

HitBTC only trades futures for AMB currently so you can't actually purchase AMB through them (although futures are trading above ICO). Currently, the only people who are accessing the EtherDelta exchange for AMB are those who already know about the project, and who could be bothered hunting down the ED address on reddit or CMC. This means pretty much the only people selling/buying it at the moment are people who already own AMB from ICO purchases. 

Is it any surprise that there is a lack of buyers? People who have already bought in ICO probably don't need that much more. The only way to market it is to be officially listed on an exchange. Look at Modum, there is no reason to justify why their market cap blew up so fast and AMB hasn't moved, aside from the fact that they've been officially listed by ED. That's why I think that AMB will make a decent run when we hit exchanges - all we're lacking is exposure. 

I think we all need to do our part in trying to get AMB listed.

Reading between the lines and doing research on Swiss Laws (this came out less than 30 days ago: https://www.finma.ch/en/news/2017/09/20170929-mm-ico/) it is obvious to me that Ambrosus is not allowed to actively seek out and solicit exchanges. Doing so would strategically be the dumbest short-term move ever, and this is a project with a long-term vision. Because they take law/compliance serious, Ambrosus is extremely restrictive in what they can't or can say. That's why some people FUD when Angel gives blanket statements that don't tell you as much as you'd like to know. He's not oblivious, he's following the law. This is Swiss compliance law and it's extremely prudent of them to think long-term and not risk regulatory compliance -- especially when they plan to work with governments &amp; corporations with reputations to uphold. This will also help them down the road for adoption and such.


Because I don't work for Ambrosus I can speak freely. I'm trying to read between the lines and personally I believe it’s in the Ambrosus communities interest to give them a lot more patience than what some people are showing. Getting on proper exchanges that are compliant/with a good reputation takes time. For those who don’t know, exchanges don’t even want to begin these conversations until your ICO is over, and once these conversations start it may takes weeks at a minimum. Lucky for us they have 3 driving forces which makes the likelihood of these listings to eventually happen:


**#1 Their advisors:**


Here's what I've found when looking at Ambrosus advisors (3 names stand out)



**1) Jaron Lukasiewicz.** He built Coinsetter which was a NYC based bitcoin exchange that Kraken acquired. So yes, the exchange that he was CEO of was bought by Kraken. Yes, that Kraken.


**2) Jehan Chu.** Has an incredibly good reputation in Asia. Founded Ethereum HK community, co-founded BTC HK community, advisor to QTUM and is a gateway to Asian connections. He's a co-founder of a blockchain investment firm Kinetic Capital. If you look deeper at Kinetic Capital here is something of note:

*Kenetic Capital is among a slew of firms that are lining up at the new frontier after soaring prices and proliferation of initial coin offerings -- sold by corporates to raise money -- boosted demand for digital assets. Chu, whose fund is advised by ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, says he isn’t interested in speculation, but rather in tokens sold by companies with strong fundamentals and long-term potential.*

and

*When we make a call for what we think is a good investment, it’s not because we think it’s a speculative play,” Chu said in an interview in Hong Kong. “It’s because we’re looking at the fundamentals based on years of experience.*

source: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-23/bitcoin-winner-looking-to-ride-crypto-wave-seeks-100-million

This is a great guy to have on Ambrosus team for all the obvious reasons.


**3) David Drake.** He's a VC/Hedge fund guy who has a lot of money/connections behind him. He's been in crypto for a while and has connections everywhere for investment/finance.


**#2 Followed stringent KYC/compliance during the ICO.** 


They KYC’d every single Ether they took into their project. Some projects are lazy and only do that for Pre-sale. I believe for those that do this, it may haunt them down the road as regulatory issues could come crashing down on them. Ambrosus didn’t take this chance, so KYC issues should be crystal clear


**#3 Token usage case makes it clearly not a security.**  


It is not a ‘share’ in the company. It’s a protocol/utility token and there is no grey area to think otherwise. It was stated in their TGE event, and along every step of the way as well. That’s why there’s no need to worry about legalease announcements coming from their social media - they’re ensuring utmost compliance. This is great for us as holders as it allows Ambrosus to maneuver without fear of a regulatory crackdown on a global scale. If you don’t believe what a difference this makes, just look at how quickly(~1 week from ICO&gt; they were able to launch a cross-continental pilot project here: https://blog.ambrosus.com/increasing-quality-coffee-trade-between-africa-china-ambrosus-pilot-project-6e5ce43814d4 


All 3 of these are extremely important, but the token not being a share in the company is critical. Some tokens are now being de-listed from many exchanges because exchanges themselves are worried about which tokens they list and what regulatory issues that may expose them to. Those 3 things I mentioned every exchange that is trying to operate legally must review comprehensively before ever deciding to list a new token. Remember, even the larger or more compliant exchanges are overwhelmed with demand for listings, hence why this all takes time. If you want to be proactive and do your part, I'd imagine writing to exchanges (just tweet them) or even messaging these advisors asking them can only help. But yes, once exchanges scrutinize Ambrosus, I believe they'll understand how clean the token usage case is and in time will list it. For now, just relax everyone and realize everything takes time :)

Even myself, holding over 100k AMB on Binance exchange didn't sold it even single token. (I'm just scooping)
Not much token dumped, but there were very few buy orders.
So price goes down hardly.

During price going down, there were no bad news.
Actually, there were good announcement, progress report that convince me on this project long term view.

Market reacts, however, right opposite to me.
Yesterday progress report was very nice. But after that, price rather tanked.
I wonder how it can happen?
Am I dumb not seeing reality?
Or majority market is irrational? or simply AMB project is under radar?

It is a ‘bonded’ token that collects data as it passes through the supply chain. Hence, those that use the system the most will inherently need the largest amounts of AMB to track large volumes of information. Whilst the end user will not have to pay anything to access the information those that create heavy traffic on the Ambrosus system will, and this gives the AMB token an underlying value (1)

Can somebody tell me how the Ambrosus team will provide enough liquidity for potential customers that want to use the platform?

I've only just discovered Ambrosus, so I'm getting my feet wet by starting to look through the documentation - and there is a lot of it!

The first thing that came to mind for me (being from the UK) is how this could have helped prevent the ""[2013 Horsemeat Scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_horse_meat_scandal)"". It was a huge deal over here and would probably make an interesting use case to add as a historical example. 

I was just wondering where I could find out more about about the sensors being developed? From what I've gathered, the sensors are going to play a critical role. I wondered if there was information about patents, and the types of sensors being developed? I also wondered, especially when every item in a batch is going to be ""tagged"" if there is any consideration to the ecological impact. Can the tags degrade, be re-used etc.

Any help pointing me in the right direction would be really appreciated :)

Huge News!","For those of you that don’t know, Ambrosus is combining high-tech sensors, blockchain protocol and smart contracts.  They are building a universally verifiable, community-driven ecosystem to assure the quality, safety &amp; origins of products (primarily food and pharma).  Ambrosus successfully raised funds and completed its Token Generation Event (ICO) about 2 months ago.



[Ambrosus AMA w/ CEO Angel Versetti](https://www.reddit.com/r/ambrosus/comments/7jkman/ama_with_angel_versetti/)



**I combed through the AMA and for those that haven’t read it here is a list of the BIG takeaways IMO:**


-[Ambrosus current marketcap is: $46M](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/amber/) meanwhile Ambrosus raised 109,500 Eth 2 months ago worth $75M today.  Therefore trading for less than their book value.


-Ambrosus is *NOT A SECURITY* and *FOLLOWED ALL THE RULES* allowing them to be 100% onside with regulations and allowing them to form *MAJOR* partnerships that otherwise couldn’t happen. People criticized Ambrosus for their TGE (Kyc’ing every single Ether) but now it’s seen as a competitive advantage.  Compliance provides an advantage to Ambrosus to get the right partners on board (established corporates, banking partners, governmental and public institutions). Other Swiss ICO’s have yet to announce partnerships most likely because they are not FINMA compliant (Swiss version of SEC).  So yes, this is super important because Ambrosus now has first-mover advantage specifically because they DID the proper compliance legwork earlier during Ambrosus TGE.


-Ambrosus is primarily working with producers / manufacturers in food &amp; pharma:


-**Talking/seat at the table with with Migros (Huge Swiss Grocery Store: 160 million customers &amp; 1,156 stores, 8th largest Swiss Business and 40B+ Annual revenue)**


-**Talking/seat at the table with Nestlé (Largest food company in the world, 335,000 employees, $90B+ revenue)**  Ambrosus has some feedback that Nestlé may be more interested in working with them over IBM.


-20 Non-Disclosure-Agreements in place with other companies including: Producer of chemical / commodities w/ $100B+ in annual revenue, Manufacturer of cosmetics w/ $4B+ in annual revenue, Food manufacturer w/ $30B+ in annual revenue, Food producing retailer w/ $25B+ in annual revenues, Food processing equipment manufacturer w/ $2B+ in annual revenue)  **That’s companies totaling $161B+ in annual revenues**


-Already confirmed partnership with Trek Therapeutics (PBC) a US-based manufacturer of antiviral drugs

-Already Working with Biofirm AG on hardware testing for factories producing meat in Italy

-Angel mentioned ""significant partnership"" with public authorities in several countries and said he hopes to share something more on this in early February

-Working with smaller companies as well.  These will be announced in 2018 Q1 and possibly other bigger partnerships as well.


-Very close to releasing v.0.1 of the platform for Ambrosus


-Have a solid plan to scale as need that could involve staking w/ masternodes (will be figured out by 2018 Q1)


-Solid economic use case for token that involves building a open and frictionless ecosystem around the token which is bound to data which represents/tracks products in the real world.  Also, there are a limited supply of tokens available forever. 


-Their most common *complaint* from their community was lack of marketing/communications (They didn’t hype themselves at all). CEO addresses this by acknowledging need for building community awareness (before he only focused on Business/Enterprise relationships) and just hired Chief Market Officer For January 2018 + 3 people for content creation + firm working on PR so I expect awareness to grow about this project



**In conclusion:** Up until this AMA done on Dec 16th 2017 95% of this was NOT public knowledge and the market has yet to properly price all this in Up until now the Ambrosus community was not aware they had this much traction/adoption already flourishing in a project that did its ICO just 2 months ago and this pretty much blew everyone's expectations.

At the same time I just want to share some key thoughts on my side here with the reddit community. My takeaways from the last few months, and reasons why I am optimistic about Ambrosus are as follows (not ranked in terms of importance):

1) **So much bullshit in the blockchain industry**. This is not a rant, this is pure bewilderment. At first many statements seem bold and revolutionary, and you may seem daunted. You look closer and dig deeper, and smoke and mirrors start becoming obvious. While we do have a few worthy adversaries (whom I will not name) as competitors, most companies that offer similar solutions are not a big concern for us. We thus focus on what matters internally and externally.

2) **I only hire dedicated operatives.** Here I am highly inspired by Elon Musk's quote ""the general understanding is that if you’re at Tesla, you’re choosing to be at the equivalent of Special Forces"". This is the philosophy I apply at Ambrosus. We don't take in average people, and if we do, they either step up their game, or they leave. We have applied high standards of work and delivery to everyone joining us, irrespective of their rank and reputation. I will continue pushing everyone to deliver. Over the last few months I have battle-tested several people and I am absolutely confident in their professionalism, autonomy and resourcefulness. I have a big plan in my mind for Ambrosus, and I am happy that our team has grown from 8 to 24 people, and soon several more highly-capable and hard-working people will join. Watch out for announcements.

3) **Product Strategy for 2018 is well defined**. Full, detailed updates will emerge around mid-January, but during the last few strategic meetings with team and partners, I have been pleasantly surprised by the quality of architecture and development for 2018. Importantly, we focus on hard-core cases where we focus on long-term adoption.

4) **Solid relationship with governments and public authorities**. Blockchain and Crypto are under heavy crackdown worldwide for a variety of reasons (both good and bad). Whether we like it or not, we do have to count with the powerful institutions (i.e. governments and corporates) and Ambrosus from the beginning has had solid relationship with them, as part of our strategy. Ambrosus has been interacting with governmental officials and the first results of this favorable relationships will be visible over the forthcoming times. I want to underscore that Ambrosus is not a puppet of any government or corporation, but nor is it opposing them. Blockchain is unleashing transformative developments upon the world, and working with existing stakeholders at a level of mutual respect and collaboration will be important for success.

5) **Virtuous circle will come into action next year.** Ambrosus has sailed during very turbulent times in the crypto-space, having gone through multiple external shocks (bans of ICOs, cryptocurrency crackdowns, regulatory crackdowns, troubles of our Technology Partner Parity, etc.). And things are still not easy for us, there are still many things for us to sort out. Importantly, however, we have taken time to create solid foundations for Ambrosus, and now upon this foundation new solutions will thrive fuelling our ecosystem. I do believe in that sense that 2018 will be a year for Ambrosus when all our individual elements and pieces will start reinforcing each other and create a positive feedback loop, a virtuous circle and make our ecosystem blossom.

And that makes me optimistic (despite the fact that I am generally in a mildly-pessimistic camp on most things).

I will say that I have huge faith in the project. I support and own WTC, VEN, AMB, and MOD. I think the project has great potential and am looking forward to what it can accomplish.

I know that many of you guys are extremely happy about the sudden spike of attention AMB is receiving. Just understand that many times, these types of spikes are done as PnD. For example, look at the most recent PnD's that occurred this week from XVG to RDD and etc. These these things happen. I have invested in several coins that have similar situations happen to them like Iota, XVG, and so many others. When coins go parabolic, thats when you need to start being wary.

Now I don't know if this is an organic growth or just a coordinated PnD but always prepare for the worst. If you sell, remember to sell high. A coin will never go up and forever go up. Look at earlier this month with BTC- hitting 19k and falling down to 10k.

This is Part 2 of a continuation story about the Ambrosus project. Before you read any farther -  for those who haven’t read [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ambrosus/comments/79a6no/why_is_ambrosus_amb_so_valuable_and_why_after_60/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) - I highly recommend reading it first as a prerequisite because the information contained in this post is assuming the reader has that foundational knowledge discussed in Part 1. I wanted to note quickly I wrote Part 1 more slanted towards the consumer and why Ambrosus is great for them; this article’s focus is explaining the business case for why businesses will adopt Ambrosus and what in turn makes it so much better than current existing solutions. And for those not yet aware, Ambrosus has been expanding their team and have two new Content Managers: Aneesh and Nataliya. I stole time away from them and they helped answer many questions I had along the way - so yeah, thanks. They’re as much responsible both for this and any future articles I write about the Ambrosus Project.


Once again, please feel free to share/use any/all of this as your own; my only goal is to spread awareness about the gravity of this project and you sharing, commenting, does just that. So thank you as well for helping me do just that. So now that you’ve refreshed yourself by reading Part 1 and have a better understanding on the problems of current supply chain solutions, let’s now unwrap what this post will cover.


**Article Start:**


The best imagery of Ambrosus to me is a 4-layer cake. There are 4 main layers to creating the best cake ever known to supply chains, and it’s important to understand each part has different influencers/drivers (for example: business, R&amp;D, developers, even marketing etc) but that’s getting ahead of ourselves. For now, just keep open to the idea that Ambrosus protocol is much bigger than just a “blockchain”. **These 4-layers are (top to bottom are):**


Developer tools / SDK

Marketplace

Sensors

Blockchain Protocol / Storage


In this post I’m going to touch on 2 topics: **[1] We’re going to dive deeper into Blockchain Protocol / Storage (#4 - the foundational and deepest layer of this cake)**. By the end of it you’ll understand why they’re allocating teams of developers to build this layer and in turn what this means for the larger ecosystem of Ambrosus. And spoiler alert: It’s pretty cool and you’ll understand exactly the value proposition to larger businesses is and why they’ll start onboarding with Ambrosus 2018 and beyond. I promise I’ll do cake layers 1,2,3 justice in another post. **The second half [2] is general market/investment sentiment** presently and how I feel about where we’re at right now and my investing mindset moving forward. This part is more OP-ED where [1] is grounded in research. Think of this as optional reading/skip over if you’re only interested in the development because it will only be opinion based - and mine at that. However, I do get DM’d quite regularly asking me how I feel about this being my second largest holding so I’ll take that as a cue to make myself feel way more important than I actually am by writing about just that in the second half of this post :)



**First half: Blockchain Protocol / Storage**




I know I just said to imagine Ambrosus ecosystem as a cake. Before that I referred to it as a supply chain protocol solution. So what’s going on? Both these are true, but perhaps *the best way* to think of it is as a comprehensive data management system that is organic and ever-evolving. Honestly, they all make sense. But more importantly, why do I think like this? Conceptually, at its core element Ambrosus is building an entire ecosystem. For this ecosystem to be robust/useful, it needs to capture all useful data and be able to present it in a way different stakeholders require. A blockchain with incomplete/unverifiable data or incomplete data flow, is of course incomplete/unverifiable with incomplete data flow. And a blockchain that can capture, store securely, and easily access this useful data on demand, will become intrinsically more valuable over time as the repository [blockchain] grows. In building this, I see Ambrosus as having to do two equally important things here: Present a convincing architecture solution that show skeptical enterprises that yes, it will accumulate, store, secure, transmit, access, and manage their data and thus will fit all their “real world” requirements for less than their existing solutions. And secondly (but equally important) further cement their intrinsic value proposition and differentiate themselves from others on what makes their solution most elegant.


We need to be critical here and realize that building a blockchain protocol that does anything less would hinder its initial adoption and become a bottleneck/achilles heel towards mass adoption down the road. Ambrosus understands this and will work with businesses to ensure it meets their requirements instead of just coming at them with technology saying: *“Use this!”* In a business sense, an approach to such a complicated project is extremely critical and cannot be overlooked: *Building the core of your ecosystem to solve reality based problems vs your imagined hypothesized problems.* I won’t touch on it in this post, but yes, the plan will be to then further be able to customize to their specific industry enterprise needs through sensor specifications &amp; developer tools built to interact seamlessly with this Blockchain protocol layer.  Different supply chain stakeholders will then be able to massage/use this data in a way that is revolutionary as we’ll get into a bit farther down. So what is all this data they’re trying to capture with this blockchain they’re building...and why do we care (stay with me on this, we do care!)


The first kind of data is called static data and there are three types. We’re going to use an iPhone for this example.


*Master Data Management:* This is product catalogue/class (ex: iPhone 8 Version 2.0 made for European Market).

*Serialization:* This would be the serial # of every single iPhone made.

*Product Batch:* This would be say you made 5,000 iPhones, you document the parameters used in this specific batch you created.


Well first off, what are enterprise companies doing right now to track these? I kid you not, but in ‘explain it like I’m 5’ terms they’re basically running big excel spreadsheets for Master Data Management. These spreadsheets have both analog (which means input is always the same as output) and manual (which means you must enter this every time something occurs) properties. This of course makes it a huge pain in the ass to update as you can imagine. Stop for one moment and read [1/2/3 from Vlad here](https://blog.ambrosus.com/ambrosus-roadmap-whats-next-by-vlad-trifa-eb3acc88a759) to better understand why enterprise businesses have not yet been able to take that step and jump to IoT and Digital properties in these systems. 


So right now in 2017 let’s say Apple wants to open up a shop in Switzerland and start manufacturing iPhones. They’d find someone within Apple who has access to the right spreadsheet (ex: Switzerland iPhone, or create this one) and then update it with these new static [1,2,3] points above. As for Serialization, it’s not stored on a blockchain either and instead on an old and obscure/closed database. Then, why is it expensive if it’s old technology?  This is because the government [we’ll take this to mean European/Swiss law] requires you to declare every product you make, so you can imagine when they update it for regulatory reasons how inefficient a system like this would be. You would require more resources needed to do this and thus higher costs. There are no economies of scale at work here when it has manual/analog properties. On top of that the more data you have, the more complexity occurs. It’s a law of entropy. Throw in government compliance/certifications depending on your industry’s/country’s needs you must abide by, and you’re left drinking a cocktail that will leave you with a huge hangover.


Now this is where I introduce you to something called called: [GAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_automated_manufacturing_practice). Make sure you read the first two paragraphs in that entry. In my own words, Gamp is a certification basically saying: *“Yup, this all looks good”* [from a legal/compliance/quality of product point-of-view]. This is especially important because industries like pharmacy state that quality cannot be tested into a batch of product, but instead must be built into each stage of the manufacturing process. Let that sink in for a minute on what that means for a major drug manufacturer and supply chain systems running with analog/manual properties. To help, switch iPhone static data example with manufacturing a common drug, say, Ibuprofen. The pharmaceutical company must ensure GAMP covers all aspects of production, hence the huge costs in compliance/storage/documentation in these fragmented systems. Hopefully by now you’re convinced why enterprise businesses would think a blockchain [an immutable ledger] would be a good usage case for static data - it serving as a secure and private data repository is already a huge value proposition. And yes, I still haven’t tied this to the Ambrosus Blockchain protocol yet (I promise I will!), because I now need you to keep your brain turned on as I introduce you to something called events data. 


This is what I really touched on in the first article. It’s the “story” of a product from a blockchain perspective. Let’s continue with an iPhone example. You just created one and you’re looking to put it in a box to get ready for shipment. Well we need to first link the newly minted iPhone being created to this box. The box will have different data than the iPhone as well (iPhone has those static data points we just went through: For simplicity let’s say its iPhone #77. Box in this example for simplicity let’s say it’s Box #22 carrying just this one iPhone). This event happens @ 1:25pm and this linkage (iPhone into box) is uploaded as Event 1 onto the Ambrosus blockchain (think of this like a tx to the blockchain; the tx has this event described [iPhone #77 in box #22] stored forever now in programmable language). The blockchain stores this data as it happens in real time (this upload may have happened through QR code, scanner etc if you’re wondering) and we’ll now continue this story. It’s now 3:54pm and the box #22 is now being put on an airplane. We create Event 2 when this occurs and it uploads to the Ambrosus Blockchain. It arrives in Paris 7:43am by plane and Event 3 occurs when the box is opened once the plane lands and the middle-chain supplier picks it up and verifies it’s there. You get the point.


Why does event data matter? You’ll get a different answer depending on who you ask. Maybe you’re a customer who wants to know the origin of your product and the materials [events data] it’s made of and the businesses you support can now provide you that data? What about a forward-looking food manufacturing business who knows that [regulatory law is steadily trending](https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/labelling_nutrition/labelling_legislation_en) towards clearer and more stringent labeling of ingredients and knows that European law specifies that you must soon put that information online for consumers to see? What about a head of marketing manager in a large grocery store: Someone who wants to say *“Hey look at how green our supply chain/product is, we can verifiably prove how clean/organic it is!”* Or the businesses internal logistics expert? Looking to reduce costs on IT and management of this data in accordance with internal processes or external ones imposed on you by GAMP? Or here’s a huge one: Or what about built in auditing processes? Well this saves remarkable overhead from hiring KPMG or Ernst &amp; Young accounting who until now have had to sift through analog/manual static data systems that have been used over the years. Or one we hear about everyday in supply chains: tainted batches (ex: e coli? salmonella?) You can quarantine/track them immediately by looking upstream from the data recorded and isolate where it happened within the different events logged, allowing a company to quantify consequences quickly. We haven’t even yet touched on 3rd parties and how valuable this could be: A 3rd party logistics provider who can build an app to optimize these shipments by air or sell any extra unused space for better efficiency on any steps in any given supply chain. Or a 3rd party developer who tells Coca-Cola they can build them an App where every time the consumer scans their QR code under the label they the consumer collects another magic coke Crypto Kitty that’s forever immutable/theirs to own (enhancing product/brand loyalty) I’m just rambling now as you can tell, but if you tried you could likely think of 50 more usage cases right now as there is infinite reasons why events data is so valuable in this day and age. This paragraph scratches only the surface and lets you begin to imagine. 


Ambrosus blockchain will ensure all this data is secured safely, accessible to only those who need to see it and properly organized. In other words, I as an end consumer, won’t be able to see Static Data - Master Data Management (unless the business wants me too, which I doubt it would, but as a consumer I don’t really care about this specific data anyhow). But for example, they could let me see the provenance of products/materials very easily through building an app where I could scan the QR code of a product (This is layer cake #1 which I’ll get into on another post). I know I haven’t even touched sensors (layer cake #3) but once again you can imagine briefly how sensors would be applicable here too to the Ambrosus story. Anyway, assume all this data, it will be documented and stored in a way where it’s on this single repository (Ambrosus Blockchain) but the protocol allows it to be compartmentalized to ensure only the proper parties are privy to it; this is especially important for businesses and a huge selling point because otherwise they’d never give you (Ambrosus) access to their data if this wasn’t the case.


If you’ve made it this far and can follow the laid out narrative, the billion dollar question becomes: Well okay, I now better understand the different kinds of data, why it’s valuable and useful/necessary to track, but why won’t businesses keep this internally? Why would they ever share this precious data with Ambrosus? Let’s roleplay this as a monologue (I’ll be Angel, Ambrosus CEO) where we’re in a boardroom with a bunch of 60 year old skeptical frosty corporate personas.

**Frosty CEO:** Hmm.. yeah errmm.. So can you remind me again why I should give you this data Angel? It sounds like I should just hire a plethora of PhD scientists and create this “blockchain” thing you speak of myself!


**Angel:** This is because we’re not the ones making the margins and our long-term incentives are aligned. This technology I described, we’ve made it to easily integrate your existing solutions. Our interest is in making AMB token gain in value and we do this by ensuring our solution is cheaper and offers a stronger value proposition than current SAP/IBM/existing solutions and thus you buy the tokens as fuel to our system. What this means from an operating cost perspective is a comprehensive, cost-saving solution that will allow you as the CEO to massively reduce your IT costs and you’ll now for the first time ever be able to store all this data in an immutable, secure single repository for eternity. 


**Frosty CEO:** Hmm.. interesting. So I’ll save some money. Sounds alright I guess, but meh I’m not sold yet. What else can this magical ecosystem do for me?


**Angel:** Built in auditing. You’ll be able to save even more money, because once again storing your data in our ecosystem will allow you to easily do this. Just ask your CFO Finance guy and….


**Frosty CEO:** Well more money saved? Cool. This seems to be a theme. You got anymore reasons why?


**Angel:** Yes, as you know you have to abide by GAMP certification seeing how you’re a major pharmaceutical company. This is tied to principles and procedures in your manufacturing process. By using us as your solution, your data will now be GAMP certified through our procedures because we built this in such a way to ensure we meet these requirements. We’ll do all the legwork and ensure our processes ensure compliance on every regulatory issue both present and in the future. We will be fully certified, both in Switzerland/Europe/globally; thus not only giving you a completely streamlined solution with verifiable documentation ensuring your Standard Operating Procedues (SOP) are compliant/easily auditable in the future, but also help your bottom line in that you’re literally going to save millions and we’ll make you look like a genius &lt;drops the mic&gt;.


**Frosty CEO:** Oh jeez.. Hmm wow ok… and umm one more thing before I sign up? You said something about digital crypto kitties? Does it come with crypto kitties too? I get these too?


**Angel:** *dies a little inside but keeps a poker face* &lt;bends down to pick up mic and questions the meaning of life in this moment&gt; Uhh yes, talk to your IT team, but yes, you could have apps built that access this data that in turn could tie product ownership and kitten ownership together.


**Frosty CEO:** *rushes over to sign papers*

	




**Second Half: General Market/Investment Sentiment**



 
Let’s just go straight to the crux of the question: Am I still choosing to hold Ambrosus right now? And why or why not? After all, there is always the opportunity cost (being in Eth, or the “next best thing”) and any investor should always consider these. I definitely do.  As of now, I’m currently offside on my investment so let’s talk about this given the current reality. I’ll begin with my thoughts on why I feel it’s underperforming thus far.


**1** The projects scope and vision is very technical and very high level. Since it is such an ambitious project with many dynamic parts, it is *very hard* to explain the scope and vision to the [crypto] audience. This takes tremendous effort and because the team is mostly scientists (seriously, just read the biographies on the team page), it wouldn’t surprise me if their skills are just that: science and not transcribing their science/tech vision to a page of paper in ways non-scientists can read. In fact, the only reason I became so bullish on this project in the first place is because I spent way too much time engrossed and read all of these tech documents and then followed up with any questions I had. There hasn’t been much documentation/literature in place yet to reach these non-scientists; moving forward my expectation is Ambrosus will better consolidate and collect bodies of work that us mere mortals can also read/understand.

**2** The lack of marketing/communication so far. This one is obvious to anyone else who has been here the whole time too. The project *“seems amazing”*, but that *“amazing”* needs to be flow to the community in a way that resonates with them. We can’t intuitively be expected to know just how much traction has been (or is) happening right now without a clear voice from within the project. I believe in August/September the project slipped into the position as *“let the tech speak for itself”* and *“our technology is our marketing”*. That alone does NOT work anymore and it’s a dangerous mistake for any team or project to make. Yes, I know there is technology here, but everyone needs to understand marketing/communications (updates even on this technology) are oh-so critical. They’ve been OK at *some* of this, but they need to get *much* better overall. While I do think this is a top 2% project as far as tech/team/roadmap goes, there is so much noise in this environment that you need to learn how to brag and market yourself. Another thing I think about: I am just one voice (who took the time to read everything). I want their strategic goal not to reach someone like me, but instead the thousands behind me who would also love this project if given the chance. And that chance will only happen if it is transcribed in an easier to follow narrative. 


**...So am I still hodling?**


The biggest reasons in my thesis on why the project hasn’t popped is obviously a mixture of **1 &amp; 2** above. On an actual technological, roadmap, and team level, these *“fundamentals”* are extremely sound on my criteria; they always have been and are improving every day. I’m going to make more of an effort moving forward to write about just those too, so you can then decide for yourself whether they make sense. 


On a *“marketing/communications”* level, that has been the achilles heel thus far. The good news is the technology/roadmap[traction]/team are the things you really need the most *no matter what*. The marketing of a project is basically telling the story of these three things to a larger audience. Because they have yet to truly do this well, if and when they do, my own beliefs is the price will reflect more of the fundamental traction of this project. If you want imagery for this idea: Lack of fundamentals but good marketing can make a project that’s built of sand look like a stone castle and a lack of marketing with great fundamentals can make a stone castle look like it’s made of sand. However, what that casual observer sees as a sand castle is still actually solid stone underneath. Wash away that layer of sand, and all of a sudden narratives can change overnight. A large part of investing in cryptocurrencies to me is targeting pricing inefficiencies in the market. Right now my belief is that this project is stone yet priced as if it’s comprised of sand ($32M).


So is Ambrosus on the road to fixing this? Yes, and I believe this for several reasons. One, I have DM’d the new content managers (Aneesh and Nataliya) and spoken at length to both of them and they’re exactly what Ambrosus needs. You’ll see in a minute a recurring theme here that I’m kind of annoying to projects. The cliffs on my conversation with them is they seem to understand everything from the perspective of a token holders point-of-view and are working extremely hard to change begin bringing content to our community that will begin reflecting the internal traction of this project. Neither of these people were here a month ago, and now they’re ingrained in the project and I imagine playing a crucial part in steering the project communications into the right direction. It’s a very reassuring signal to me they’re both helpful and accessible and I’m planning to give them the patience and support they need to be able to do their job. Let’s remember though this is a long road and I know what you’re thinking right now: what about Angel (the CEO)?


I reached out to Angel on Discord and let him know that I wanted to chat with him about some of these concerns. *“This”* being **1 &amp; 2** and the disconnect I could feel in our community. Let me be clear: Our community is awesome and in my opinion has the right sentiment: patience, understanding the professionalism of this project, less *“moon”* talks and actual in-depth discussion. These are all amazing things, but the disconnect I am talking about is Ambrosus’ ability to connect with them and share with them their ongoing traction that’s been happening since the ICO. And there *has* been a lot. I digress, so back to Angel: He actually responded and then took a Skype call with me. He listened for over forty minutes to me explaining what I thought the problem was, asked me very good questions I hoped someone in his spot would ask me and then we talked candidly about it. Think about that for a minute: I’m just an investor, he already has my Eth and frankly could have told me to shove it or been extremely defensive or even played the power card; instead he listened to my concerns with an open mind and acknowledged me. My own feeling is if he wasn’t serious about this, he wouldn't have spoken to me as long as he did, nor would he have been receptive to my concerns or picked my brain the way he did. From talking with him, I didn’t learn anything you guys also don’t also know, except that very important bit of information (my own feeling on him) that he actually cares deeply about us token holders and many times is limited by what he can or can’t say by law. 

Interesting anecdote: He took this call at super late local time on his end and never once cut me off when I was talking; the guy really is working 15 hours a day 7 days a week and I can tell you right now that’s more than 99.9% of these ICO’s are doing and in my books that counts for a lot. And yes, that’s always been my read on him since I first badgered him pre-TGE with questions about the project (check my public post history if you care to see about what) and yet another very strong reason I think this project will have a bright future.


Let’s make sure we understand something here too: Him or Ambrosus, they’re never legally going to say “This token price must go up! I’m going to pump this token to make it happen!” I get that and hopefully everyone here does too. I understand law and compliance and know you cannot say stuff like this - and frankly if as an investor if you’re focusing on that alone you’re likely missing the forest through the trees. The most important thing to me is not whether a CEO is perfect, but when things go offcourse can they adapt and get us back on course. He hasn’t had a perfect record thus far, no CEO ever will, what I I’d rather do is evaluate him on is whether he is working hard *right now* behind the scenes to turn and pushing Ambrosus towards a bright future. That future is made from building blocks in the present - *those right now*. 


And my impression is he is doing this. To point to two external factors: One, we now have two new content managers (who seem very on-the-ball) and two, Angel just announced he’s doing an AMA Saturday. To me these are clear data points to the narrative that we’re moving in the right direction and if they keep continue placing these building blocks we should of course give them patience and our full support to do just that. So let’s not waste this opportunity by asking unanswerable questions like “Why are you not soliciting exchanges?” (Answer: Swiss law prevents him; they have government partnerships and can’t risk compliance) and instead ask him questions that really matter to us (or should). I’m going to participate in that AMA (I hope you all do too if these things matter to you) and will further evaluate Ambrosus on how he answers our questions as a community.

The last thing I want to point out is just how inefficient the market seems overall and how it’s still maturing and converging towards pricing assets more accurately. That’s just my opinion, but we can all look to this last month for examples where we saw random junk pump 400-900% while in this time solid projects went sideways didn’t *“pop”*. I’m not a big believer in chasing after a win and instead look for true value.  That’s because when there is true value the market price will be pulled towards the intrinsic price until they converge (like gravity); although it may not happen today or tomorrow, eventually it will happen. Those gravitational pushes: team/tech/roadmap execution in this project - I think they’re only getting stronger every day. All that needs to happen is for Ambrosus to *‘brush’* that metaphorical layer of sand off their castle and let the crypto world understand that value. I will be giving them time to do just that.


**Lastly, since I love lists, here are some more bullet points that people may not be aware of yet or thinking about in this moment but should likely be taken into consideration:**


**1.)** **Ambrosus is fully KYC compliant (Kyc’d every Ether) and with clear utility token case.** Yes, I do expect them to get listed on major exchanges (Bittrex, Coinbase in 2018, others) moving forward in 2018 for that reason and the fact that the path to getting listed on exchanges isn’t as hard as most people think (assuming the token usage case is as clear cut as Ambrosus; and good news we’re talking about Ambrosus here).


**2.)** Took in over 109,000 Ether (Market price today = ~$80M). I asked after TGE, and one of the community managers at that time told me they’re looking to *“sell as they need it, while ensuring we have enough to complete our roadmap at all time”*. In other words, **they’re sitting on a pile of Ether (likely 2.5-3x their marketcap as of time of this posting)** and I trust Angel to be able to use this extra gift well (roadmap acceleration, hires, external resources, business development, marketing, etc). This is a hidden catalyst &amp; market inefficiency often overlooked and extremely relevant they raised at the prices they did (Eth was ~280-320 IIRC).


**3.)** Marketing/Communications leading to a proper reflection in token value. Honestly, this project (assuming no major market crash) has no reason why it can’t be many multiples higher than where it is now in starting as early as Q1 2018. The reason I think that as well is:


The project makes sense. Honestly, not many do.  The *“real world”* proof is Angel has mentioned they have literally dozens of corporations/MOU’s/NDA’s underway as we speak. The market has not reacted to this news yet (nor has it been marketed well yet), but I believe anytime, even as early as Q1 2018 a partnership could easily double+ Ambrosus’ marketcap overnight. From there, other investors will *“google/research”* Ambrosus and realize how much merit this project has. I see this a spark that can be lit by many means: Ignited by either stronger marketing, partnership announcements, or roadmap progress/traction transcribed properly to their community. All of these I believe are highly likely to happen in the foreseeable future.


Everything that is *“currently”* a problem is entirely fixable. There are zero terminal illnesses in this project. The fact the market has priced it so low thus far is unfortunate for those with little patience or short time frames, but because I strongly believe for reasons listed above the token price will likely converge towards its true value in 2018 onwards.


So I’ll leave this post at that. You now have pretty much my entire thought process on why I still believe this is an extremely good investment. Time will tell whether this holds true, but I am still an adamant believer for these reasons stated and see no reason to deviate from my initial assumptions. Anyhow, I’m always around (you can DM me if you have questions/feedback but even better ask publicly because other people might be wondering the same) and I’m planning to write more about this project’s technology in the future because I believe in sharing this project with others. I’ve had people reach out to me saying they discovered this gem (Amber -  pun intended) just through our community talking about it -  so yes - if you also think this project is worth talking about too and have an interest in it, please do share/link/use this as your own and let’s just get talking about it. We can all do our part to build and grow this awesome community and I hope to share the ups (&amp; downs) with you all in its channels as this project continues to push forward into new grounds. Cheers everybody.

2017 has been an epic year for Ambrosus. We’d like to share our top 10 of the key developments of this past year, and thank you for your support. We’ll see you in 2018!

1. Food monitoring.
This year, Ambrosus has launched a demo for a blockchain-based ecosystem that uses sensors and smart contracts to track and monitor food supply chain from farm to fork. A number of new Dapps and Core Protocol is now in development, with early releases planned for Q1 2018

2. Building the future with Ethereum and blockchain.
Parity Technologies, founded by Ethereum co-founder Dr. Gavin Wood and former Ethereum head of security and audits Dr. Jutta Steiner, came onboard to guide the project as technical advisors"" Parity was created to solve the thorniest and most complex problems,” Wood said to CoinTelegraph.Thanks to this partnership, expect to see us hold workshops on architecture development with the Parity team as we will continue to work closely together in 2018.""

3. The team has tripled.
At the time of the TGE, Ambrosus had just 8 team members. We’ve grown to a team of 24 across Engineering, IT Development, Marketing, and Business and Operations verticals. And yes, we’re hiring, so if you're an experienced developer, an ambitious growth hacker, or interested in other opportunities we may have coming up in 2018, please reach out to careers@ambrosus.com.

4. First public partnerships with the private sector.
In 2017, Trek Therapeutics, Cantone Group, Biofirm AG and INS Ecosystem partnered with Ambrosus to overhaul the supply chains for food and pharma. For example,on the INS Ecosystem platform, “all manufacturers will be able to list and sell products directly to consumers, get customer feedback, and reward loyal customers,” reported Blockchain News, whereas with Trek the objective is to demonstrate that “while our drugs are affordable, they're also of the highest quality”, said Dr Ann Kwong to Business Insider

5. Pilot coffee project between Africa and China.
One of our upcoming DApps will be based on a real-world cross-continental pilot project led by Dr Joseph Wang, former Vice-President at JP Morgan and an expert in both blockchain and international supply chains. Small investors will be able to provide micro-loans to coffee farmers in Africa with the possibility of tokenization and resale of these loans, while providing liquidity to the farmers, permitting them to execute their orders. The coffee farmers will upload details of coffee produced and track the shipment with the Ambrosus data system, as well as reach new buyers in China.

6. The R&amp;D Lab.
Under the leadership of Dr. Stefan Meyer, our team is performing cutting-edge research and prototype development for the next generation of blockchain-ready hardware devices and sensors. To ensure high-quality and reliable data, we are currently talking with a variety of sensor manufacturers so that we can test and integrate their products. We are also developing gateways and protocols that will allow these sensors to integrate and communicate directly with the Ambrosus network.

7. Ambrosus partnered with the United Nations 10YFP Sustainable Food Systems.
This special programme on sustainable food production and consumption offers challenges Ambrosus can tackle jointly with partners from the public and private sector to solve the key questions of sustainable development. “Sometimes trade barriers are erected using fallacious points, such as quality over price,” we told CryptoCoin News. “However, blockchain has the ability to not only safely record food safety and provenance; its immutable nature can be used as a point of proof. In the world of food production this is very important.”

8. The NDAs.
We’re closing the year with 20 NDAs in place, indicating strong corporate and business interest in Ambrosus. While we can’t yet make the details of our ongoing work public, we can tell you that we’re currently engaging with a producer of chemicals and commodities (100 Billion+ USD in annual revenues); cosmetics manufacturer (4 Billion+ USD in annual revenues); food manufacturer (30+ Billion USD in annual revenues); retailer producing various consumer goods including food (25 billion+ USD in annual revenues); food processing equipment manufacturer (2 billion+ USD in annual revenues). Once our engagement transforms into a public partnership, we will make more detailed announcements.

9. The AMA.
Connecting with the community has been and continues to be important to Ambrosus, and you’ll be sure to hear more from us in 2018. Meanwhile, our CEO Angel Versetti did an AMA on Reddit to keep everyone informed. Please take a look at the AMA here.

10. First Hackathon
Food Hack 2017 in Geneva had Ambrosus as one of the challenge organisers. We’ve seen great projects emerge tackling food waste, tracing origins of produce to ensure sustainability, and other great ideas teams worked on during those intense 52 hours. We look forward to organising more hackathons in 2018, to discover talent and new use cases for its blockchain. Interested in collaborating? Please send us a note at info@ambrosus.com


Blockchain will transform the world in 2018
There has been no lack of controversy in technology headlines of 2017, but here’s the fact: Technology is also one of the key ways we can transform the world and foster positive change.
 
For example, in just a few years, Ambrosus aims to become a backbone for the product flows of smart cities. It could power inventories of products, intelligently deliver products to people focusing on not only the quality of the product, but also its environmental impact. Our  open decentralized data ecosystem could connect various actors across the supply chains, allow for recording of various types of product related data using sensors, and store them in scalable blockchain data management systems. We intend to help third-party developers to build apps on top of our data ecosystem, potentially helping solve a large number of consumer and business issues, and employ arrays of smart contracts that would be fully legally recognizable and widely used by companies.
 
Thank you for your support of Ambrosus. We continue to work on transforming our supply chains into healthy, efficient and transparent systems, empowering the producers and consumers in the food and pharma industries. Stay tuned for more news in 2018.
 
 
Wishing you a Happy New Year from Ambrosus HQ.
Happy 2018!

I bought my first amb today and very excited!

I have a few questions:

- is a hardware wallet absolutely necessary?

- I bought etherum and converted into AMB through binance. I don't really get the whole price thing amb/eth. Etherum price fluctations wouldn't effect my earnings correct? Only thing that matters AMB goes up? For example, I have 100 AMB and etherum is at 1000.
IF etherum hits 500 but AMB stays the same, it makes no difference to me?

With that in mind, I am trying to understand how the AMB token will grow in value in relation to adoption of the Ambrosus as a supply chain solution. This particular bit catches my interest.

&gt;End consumers can claim tokens at the end of the cycle. In this
way, tokens can be recycled and return to the ecosystem. The
value gained by recycling tokens incentivizes consumers to purchase
Ambrosus-tracked products. This cycle also benefits producers,
who receive free promotion.

The incentive to use the token and recapture it *is basically a customer reward program*. Is this correct? Now I wholly support and agree with blockchain enterprise solutions, but I am having a hard time understanding how the AMB token in particular will grow in value, except by its deflationary nature as tokens are destroyed and not recaptured - assuming mass adoption. Has Ambrosus explained how customers will reclaim this token and be rewarded for it?

Is there something else I am missing? Some of you are probably much more versed in the technology than I am, I read the whitepaper a couple of times and everything looks very solid from a business standpoint, but I am mostly concerned about the long term potential of the token itself. 

My ultimate question is: **why should I hold AMB as anything other than a speculative asset?** What incentive is there for anybody to hold this token, so that Ambrosus can enjoy the benefits of a distributed ledger and offer it to their customer? I don't really 'get it'. So please help me out.

Essentially, I'm sold on the idea that supply chain solutions are going to lead the way in terms of a real-world use case for blockchain technologies.

However, in terms of the specific AMB project, it would be good if those who have been involved for some time could speak to any areas of concern or potential pitfalls, as these exist for all projects and I am struggling to see them here. Perhaps it is the utility of the token itself?

I'm not very clear on this. I read https://blog.ambrosus.com/instructions-on-adding-amber-to-wallets-84fecb13f107 but I don't use these wallets not desktop/web wallets. eg myethwallet

I plan to hold for 18 months

As Ambrose is not on a Ledger Nano (actually I think it is, but I don't want to put it there for now nor have a clue how to do it). I'm thinking of putting it with some others on a dedicated mobile I have for crypto. I generally save the seed and delete the app. Keeping the mobile seed safe and restoring it as need be. 

I'm seeing a lot of wallets for ETH but I don't recognise the names nor trust these.

Does AMB work with Coinomi for example? 

I tried https://steemit.com/crypto/@libert/how-to-manually-add-any-ethereum-tokens-to-coinomi-wallet-2017811t1128971z but it looks a bit sketchy - AMB is showing up under ETH - Do I just send AMB to my ETH address? I tried https://checker.ambrosus.com/ and got ""Sorry, this address hasn't been validated by our KYC process."" before any transaction. 

What is the scenario of an app going bust, how to restore AMB in this case? 

I was going to buy this morning but will hold until I know/understand the above.

Finally: Binnance or Kucoin and why? I read here Binnance was charging a lot for transfers.

Ambrosus successfully raised funds and completed its Token Generation Event (ICO) about 3 months ago.


Ambrosus is a project that has tons of potential, has a rock solid team, has already gained major traction and is sorely needed in the world. Recently they hired a [Chief Market Officer](https://blog.ambrosus.com/say-hello-to-elena-yunusov-cmo-at-ambrosus-cc846169cf20) to help bring awareness to this project (In 2017 their focus has been heads down developing their protocol layer). Other big news is [V.1 of their platform + their first Dapp](https://www.reddit.com/r/ambrosus/comments/7ntns6/what_are_the_differences_between_ambrosus_vs/ds53zlp/) are coming up in the next few weeks too! 

**You can learn about some of the major takeaways about the project from the latest AMA with the CEO** [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ambrosus/comments/7k9jiw/key_takeaways_from_ambrosus_ama_w_ceo_angel/)

Question...do these high-tech, anti-tampering sensors already exist, or are they in development? I believe this is far better and more advanced than RFID chips that some other projects are using...not knocking the other projects

Are these sensors being created within AMB, giving them proprietary ownership of the sensors/technology?

Also, AMB looks to have a decent sized, very educated team!! Based on the website, they sound like they’re super knowledgeable and capable of achieving this great task.

I have read the whitepaper and it seems to me that IOTA would be the perfect fit for this project, offering zero fees and unlimited scalability for data transactions. Using the Ethereum network there will always be transaction fees and complex token economics that may not be attractive for potential customers. 

I know that IOTA is still in its infancy but in my view embracing it in an early stage could give Ambrosus the edge over other supply chain projects. Seeing that Oliver Bussmann (President of Crypto Valley Association) is an advisor to both IOTA and Ambrosus and that both are members of the Crypto Valley Association, the founders must be aware of IOTA.

Could someone explain to me why they have chosen Ethereum over IOTA and why they did not go for an economic model like Modum?

Ambrosus presented at the Unlock Blockchain event at Dubai; our Chief Product Officer Dr. Vlad Trifa explained how blockchain technology can provide transparency and accountability, offer verifiable way to track products through supply chain, and reduce costs.

“Blockchain adds a new layer - before blockchain came along, monitoring quality of supply chains was much more difficult and required significant infrastructure and financial investments,” he said during his panel at Unlock Blockchain. “And now we’re about to see supply chains change, introduce efficiences, and at the end of the day, influence products pricing, from diamonds to food. There’s a huge potential for companies and governments to collaborate and innovate in this market, and introduce new solutions.”

In his keynote address, Oliver Bussmann, a technology thought leader focused on large-scale transformation at multinational organizations also spoke about the problems and and opportunities companies like Ambrosus are now solving.

I'd like to start with Waltonchain, as I already posted in the Ambrosus discord about this. The difference between Waltonchain (WTC) and Ambrosus is quite clear: 

Walton provides mere RFID-based position tracking. That's of course useful for applications such as logistics providers, but it's a far cry from the integrated sensor suite as proposed by the Ambrosus team. 
Simple use case: Your company is tracking their shipments of storage-sensitive produce using either chain, imagine cocoa beans, tobacco, coffee etc. At one point in the chain, there is a problem - a crate gets left standing in the tropic sun for hours, it gets stored in a very humid place, maybe it gets dropped off a forklift. Whatever you have in mind, let's say the content goes bad. Using WTC, you can tell which facilities the crate went through after discovering the problem. Of course, if the problem persists and if you investigate further, you might get a good idea which part of the supply chain might be to blame - but actually, WTC gives you no idea at all at which point in the chain the problem occurred before you noticed there was something wrong, and gives you no way of attributing responsibility to a specific facility or logistics partner. 
Ambrosus on the other hand would give you the exact time and position where the problem occurred, and could even automatically alert the logistics manager responsible to prevent the problem from ever occurring, for example immediately when the temperature reaches a pre-set threshold. Just as well, it could be used for automatically charging agreed-upon penalties for shipments that were subjected to less-than-optimum conditions by external partners along their way. It's a completely different ball-game to simply tracking the position of your shipment using RFID tags. 

What position do you guys have on the differences between Ambrosus and the rest of the competition? Any good usecases?

So my suggestions would be to put the AMB logo for our sub, maybe add flairs for users, and perhaps create both a daily price discussion and a general daily discussion. We may not need those now, but we will before long. What do you guys think?

I understand AMB tokens will be used by it's customers and is pretty much the only token that can work with AMB blockchain's protocol. 

So if for example a customer requires 500 tokens in a month, the higher the price of the tokens, the worse off that customer is. A significant increase in AMB price would effectively price out certain customers and infact discourage new ones from adopting, I think.

Since the supply of AMB tokens is fixed, and I assume no tokens are burnt, doesn't the above effectively put a price cap on AMB token? I know it sounds counterintuitive that something with a fixed supply and increasing demand should (in theory) increase in price. But wouldn't a higher price start to drive away existing customers - assuming all customers HAVE to buy AMB tokens to use?

Also, how does AMB as a company make money? Again, if it makes money by selling/issuing AMB tokens to customers - this will have to be done at a price close to market price. If any lower, then that is undercutting existing investors. If any higher, then the customer thinks why not buy from the open market. However, if the market price is too high, there aren't that many customers so lower adoption and hence lower token price.

Phew .. I suppose I'm trying to get my head around token economics and whilst I have read kazuya's posts (the one who writes long research posts - appreaciate all your efforts and many thanks for your research!!) I can't quite visualise how AMB ecosytem along with AMB tokens are supposed to work and create value, not just for investors but also customers.

Appreciate any thoughts/explanation.

The idea of tracking provenance and supply chain is very appealing to many industries but why is Blockchain the way to do it?
For each transaction there will be a need to authenticate it and therefore a need to run the algorithms through the blockchain network. With all the discussions out there about how much computing power and energy is needed to validate each transaction, is Ambrosus doing anything to reduce or better yet drastically minimize those burdens?
Also speed of transaction will be important, with the blockchain bottleneck as it is now (in its infancy) how can someone guarantee that this delay does not continue to increase exponentially without having to pay higher fees?

I would love to learn more about what this company is doing in this space.

Also while we are at it, is there someone (some other company) that is working on these issues. I know the Etherum community is doing something to address the single chain/node need, and decouple some of the blockchain transactions (sharding for example) but I am not sure this really solves the problem of computing power and delays with mass adoption.

After reading a bit about Ambrosus, I picked up some Amber via Binance today. Not a ton; I only buy in small increments, so it's nothing I can't afford to lose. But I like this project and think it's a good long-term use of blockchain. 

Here's my question. Since this a long-term hold, I'd like to transfer my Amber to a paper wallet for long-term storage. As I understand it, you can use typical Ethereum wallets with Amber (MyEtherWallet, Parity, etc.). Does anyone know if that extends to Ethereum paper wallets?

If no one knows, I'm willing to test it out on my own &amp; report back. Just thought I'd check here first.

EDIT: I tested sending Amber to a paper wallet from Binance. It worked perfectly (despite my backwards method of doing so).

I started loading up Parity Wallet. Unfortunately, it installed on my SSD and rapidly began to fill it up with the ETH blockchain. So I halted the download, copied out the wallet JSON file, and loaded it into MyEtherWallet. It recognized the file at once, and prompted me to print a paper wallet for my address. I did so. 

Then I ran a withdrawal from Binance of just 10 AMB, sent to the now-paper wallet's address. Took a few hours, but then, pop! I rechecked the wallet in MyEtherWallet and found all 10 AMB right there.

So, if you're getting into Amber and want to use a paper wallet, you're in luck. Just go to MyEtherWallet and create a fresh paper wallet. Send AMB to that address, just like you would any other crypto. Done. The paper wallet option works!",NA,"7ofwu4",NA,0,NA,"false",1518500316,"false","self","t5_3mh72","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/ambrosus/comments/7ofwu4/paper_wallet_option/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

2017 has been an epic year for Ambrosus. We’d like to share our top 10 of the key developments of this past year, and thank you for your support. We’ll see you in 2018!


 
**1. Food monitoring.**

This year, Ambrosus has launched a demo for a blockchain-based ecosystem that uses sensors and smart contracts to track and monitor food supply chain from farm to fork. A number of new Dapps and Core Protocol is now in development, with early releases planned for Q1 2018

 

**2. Building the future with Ethereum and blockchain.**
 
Parity Technologies, founded by Ethereum co-founder Dr. Gavin Wood and former Ethereum head of security and audits Dr. Jutta Steiner, came onboard to guide the project as technical advisors"" Parity was created to solve the thorniest and most complex problems,” Wood said to CoinTelegraph.Thanks to this partnership, expect to see us hold workshops on architecture development with the Parity team as we will continue to work closely together in 2018.""
 
**3.The team has tripled.**
 
At the time of the TGE, Ambrosus had just 8 team members. We’ve grown to a team of 24 across Engineering, IT Development, Marketing, and Business and Operations verticals. And yes, we’re hiring, so if you're an experienced developer, an ambitious growth hacker, or interested in other opportunities we may have coming up in 2018, please reach out to **careers@ambrosus.com.**


**4. First public partnerships with the private sector.**
 
In 2017, Trek Therapeutics, Cantone Group, Biofirm AG and INS Ecosystem partnered with Ambrosus to overhaul the supply chains for food and pharma. For example,on the INS Ecosystem platform, “all manufacturers will be able to list and sell products directly to consumers, get customer feedback, and reward loyal customers,” reported Blockchain News, whereas with Trek the objective is to demonstrate that “while our drugs are affordable, they're also of the highest quality”, said Dr Ann Kwong to Business Insider

 
**5. Pilot coffee project between Africa and China.**

One of our upcoming DApps will be based on a real-world cross-continental pilot project led by Dr Joseph Wang, former Vice-President at JP Morgan and an expert in both blockchain and international supply chains. Small investors will be able to provide micro-loans to coffee farmers in Africa with the possibility of tokenization and resale of these loans, while providing liquidity to the farmers, permitting them to execute their orders. The coffee farmers will upload details of coffee produced and track the shipment with the Ambrosus data system, as well as reach new buyers in China.

**6.The R&amp;D Lab.**
 
Under the leadership of Dr. Stefan Meyer, our team is performing cutting-edge research and prototype development for the next generation of blockchain-ready hardware devices and sensors. To ensure high-quality and reliable data, we are currently talking with a variety of sensor manufacturers so that we can test and integrate their products. We are also developing gateways and protocols that will allow these sensors to integrate and communicate directly with the Ambrosus network.



 
**7. Ambrosus partnered with the United Nations 10YFP Sustainable Food Systems.** 
 
This special programme on sustainable food production and consumption offers challenges Ambrosus can tackle jointly with partners from the public and private sector to solve the key questions of sustainable development. “Sometimes trade barriers are erected using fallacious points, such as quality over price,” we told CryptoCoin News. “However, blockchain has the ability to not only safely record food safety and provenance; its immutable nature can be used as a point of proof. In the world of food production this is very important.”

**8.The NDAs.**

We’re closing the year with 20 NDAs in place, indicating strong corporate and business interest in Ambrosus. While we can’t yet make the details of our ongoing work public, we can tell you that we’re currently engaging with a producer of chemicals and commodities (100 Billion+ USD in annual revenues); cosmetics manufacturer (4 Billion+ USD in annual revenues); food manufacturer (30+ Billion USD in annual revenues); retailer producing various consumer goods including food (25 billion+ USD in annual revenues); food processing equipment manufacturer (2 billion+ USD in annual revenues). Once our engagement transforms into a public partnership, we will make more detailed announcements.

**9.The AMA.** 

Connecting with the community has been and continues to be important to Ambrosus, and you’ll be sure to hear more from us in 2018. Meanwhile, our CEO Angel Versetti did an AMA on Reddit to keep everyone informed. Please take a look at the AMA here.

**10. First Hackathon**
 
Food Hack 2017 in Geneva had Ambrosus as one of the challenge organisers. We’ve seen great projects emerge tackling food waste, tracing origins of produce to ensure sustainability, and other great ideas teams worked on during those intense 52 hours. We look forward to organising more hackathons in 2018, to discover talent and new use cases for its blockchain. Interested in collaborating? Please send us a note at info@ambrosus.com
 
**Blockchain will transform the world in 2018**

 
There has been no lack of controversy in technology headlines of 2017, but here’s the fact: Technology is also one of the key ways we can transform the world and foster positive change. 

 
For example, in just a few years, Ambrosus aims to become a backbone for the product flows of smart cities. It could power inventories of products, intelligently deliver products to people focusing on not only the quality of the product, but also its environmental impact. Our  open decentralized data ecosystem could connect various actors across the supply chains, allow for recording of various types of product related data using sensors, and store them in scalable blockchain data management systems. We intend to help third-party developers to build apps on top of our data ecosystem, potentially helping solve a large number of consumer and business issues, and employ arrays of smart contracts that would be fully legally recognizable and widely used by companies.

 
Thank you for your support of Ambrosus. We continue to work on transforming our supply chains into healthy, efficient and transparent systems, empowering the producers and consumers in the food and pharma industries. Stay tuned for more news in 2018.

Investing, I suppose, is putting money into something with a view of getting a little more back, either a regular stream or a lump sum.

Given that AMB token is a utility token, and appreciating the fact that token economics are being worked upon and will be released soon, I've been wondering are there any other ways in which we can actually ""invest"" in the company?

Buying the utility token is speculating that someone will buy it back from you at a higher price than you have bought. From the information we have so far, there doesn't seem to be any real benefit to ""holding"" (or hodling) the AMB token.

I recollect that the company said during TGE (in some interview) that buying the token is purely a way of ""supporting"" the project - and is not really a way to invest -- something to this effect.

Regardless, I have myself bought a small amount of AMB because I think the project is interesting but are there any other (better) ways of actually investing in this project/company?",NA,"7u40xx",NA,0,NA,"false",1518604817,"false","self","t5_3mh72","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/ambrosus/comments/7u40xx/investing_in_ambrosus/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,1

I just saw a documentary at Netflix, ""Rotten"". 
I am pretty surprised to how minute examination is required to verify food quality and origin. (at docu, it was ""Honey"") 
There were prestigious Laboratory that verify Honey ingredient and could know where that honey is from, how good it is. With this fact, I am worried how Ambrosus laboratory could cover all that broad food&amp;pharmarcy industry? Is there any plan to make partnership with other labs that are prestigious at each specific sector? (e.g. pharmarcy, cheese, milk, meat, wine, beer, honey etc.)

Plus, knowing food ingredients and origin is an issue about not only safety but also policy. American bee farmers wanted to prevent Chinese cheap honey import. In response to their desire, petition government exercise anti-dumping action. Chinese honey exporters have measure, however, they export via other countries. (e.g. Taiwan, Malayisa, etc.) In this situation, to make government action valid, there are needs to have exact criteria to distinct. This distinction is needed but would takes high cost if government do in real. In this regard, government would have utility to use Ambrosus net. (my guess, hope)
Is there any plan to make partnership with government authority?
regulation policy cost would be dramatically reduced!!!

Maybe I am overly hyped but I thought it is worth to discuss.

Listen: I am not trying to *“FUD”* other projects, but instead provide objective analysis on Ambrosus and help you further understand [my own] reasoning behind why Ambrosus is extremely undervalued. I read our forums and see questions come up over and over - I even read someone arguing that Ambrosus [maybe not even be undervalued](https://www.reddit.com/r/ambrosus/comments/7p7fdq/modum_stealing_all_the_attention_ambrosus/dsgri7f/) which is why I wanted to clear the air here. I have nothing against Modum and am only using them as a comparison for book value. They’re good for this example because both ICO’s were completed around same time, have also shown a lot of great traction and they’re also working in supply chain solutions and seem to get asked about a lot. I know many AMB holders also hold MOD and vice versa, so to be clear I do believe they’ve shown great progress as well and I have never said anything bad about them (and won’t here) because this post’s focus will be about Ambrosus. I just read our own forums, and see what people are saying and understand how I can help educate people to draw their own conclusions by presenting sourced facts in this analysis. Please read it, double check all my sources, and then decide for yourself if it makes any sense. That is up to you, but this post will make the business case for why I am confident Ambrosus is extremely undervalued. 


**Let us begin:**


Both projects did an ICO ending just a few months ago. Book value is a professional term which is the value of an asset as seen on the company’s books. If there was to be fundamental analysis in crypto (for the price of a token) it should trade at book value + speculative/subjective value = token price. If, for example, a company sucks or is making zero traction, it can have negative subjective value and trade below book value for this reason. If they did absolutely nothing (zero traction or future progress, while spending nothing) theoretically they should trade at book value (price of their known assets). Subjective value is of course community opinion, future potential, subjective/traction created. I think both projects mentioned have strong subjective value, but this post will focus on book value first and foremost.


**Here are all my assumptions made:**

-Both ICO’s kept all their ICO funds (both ICO’s ended a few months ago; not a hard stretch to imagine they likely have a very large majority of their holdings still in cryptocurrencies)

-Value is derived from CMC using Jan 10 2018 pricing

-NEITHER company has any “subjective"" value baked in; in other words they should trade as an entity that has done nothing/will do nothing but sit on their assets (also known as stripping away both companies “traction/subjective” value to get Book value)


**What should each be worth?**


Ambrosus: raised 109,XXX Eth. I can’t find an official source for this, so I’ll thus chop it down to 106,000 because it can be sourced [here](http://www.the-blockchain.com/2017/10/15/ambrosus-token-generation-event-tge-officially-cracks-largest-blockchain-crowdfunded-projects-history/). That article was printed during TGE/ICO and I know they raised 3K more, but because I want this post 100% factual with sources so I will use 106,000 as my marker.


Ambrosus still has 90,369,359 AMB tokens as well to use at their disposal. So when an ICO happens they receive Ether and give out tokens. For book value we must look at how tokens are dispersed. [25% goes to Partner development](https://blog.ambrosus.com/amber-token-allocation-intended-use-of-proceeds-d6a34b7a62f1). 16.8% go to team, 16.8% go to advisors, and 40% go to crowd sale (none of these matter for book value but  the partner development pool matters because it is an asset yet to be used) What this means is 25% of all existing Amber (361,477,438 AMB x 0.25 x market price today $1.13 = worth $103,117,376 will be used to fortify and grow partnerships.


Modum: Raised 2,163 BTC, 1813 ETH, 1796 IOTA [source](https://modum.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/wrap-up-graphics-01.jpg) 


Modum also has 9,000,000 tokens to use towards at their disposal. [Source](https://modum.io/modum-token-sale-legal-terms)


**Ambrosus book value calculation:**



Crypto from ICO + Tokens on balance sheet yet to be used = Book Value

106,000 Eth x $1,350 = $143,100,000

90,369,359 AMB x $1.13 = $103,117,376

Book Value = **$246,217,376**

Market Value: ~$161M.

Market value premium over Book Value= **-$85M**

The market is pricing Ambrosus’ subjective value at -$85M which is absolutely, literally insane. That is 34.6% below book value.


**Modum book value calculation:**


Crypto from ICO + Tokens on balance sheet yet to be used = Book Value

$33,492,562 + $96,480,000 = $129,972,562*

*Math shown here:

2,163 BTC x $14,350 = $31,039,050

1,813 ETH x $1350 = $2,447,550

1796 IOTA x $3.32 = $5,962

9,000,000 MOD x 10.72 = $96,480,000

Modum Book Value = **$129,972,562**

Market Value today: ~$196M.

Market Value premium over Book Value = **$66M.**


The market is pricing Modums’ subjective value at +$66M which seems reasonable. It could even be considered undervalued - and honestly it likely is as they're going great things and showing very solid traction. But just STOP and compare that to Ambrosus subjective value for a minute (-$85M) and make sure you understand these calculations and why these should matter on some level.


So let's be clear: These are just hard numbers, based on facts with sources, and you can come to your own conclusions from them. I am showing everyone this analysis because I do come from a finance background and being a professional investor this is worth being aware of because it is a true market anomaly and the only reason I can explain this is either the market feels Ambrosus has made negative traction (IMO false) or it is NOWHERE yet converging towards being efficient (IMO true)


For those who are looking to learn more about why I feel they’re “worthy” of a much bigger valuation than -$85M and why I believe in 2018 it'll be their time to shine I will give you 5 more good reasons here:


**#1 Partnerships.** [See here for an official list](https://www.reddit.com/r/ambrosus/comments/7ldioo/list_of_known_ambrosus_partnerships/)

Big ones here are: Trek therapeutics are already doing pilots, as is Wageni technologies, as is Bitquant labs. Swiss Canton of Vaud Government gave them money to help develop their protocol (Government of Switzerland). Crypto Valley Association (This is the ‘Blockchain’ Silicon Valley of Europe) their president Oliver Bussman is an official advisor and gave Ambrosus an endorsement. Parity Technologies (and through them Gavin Wood) are partners. United Nations 10 year food programme are partners.


**#2 NDAs with 20+ companies** that have combined revenue streams of 300B+ including Nestle (World’s largest food producer 160B+ revenue and Migros (largest Swiss Grocery store with 1,156 stores and 90B+ revenue) [Sourced here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ambrosus/comments/7jkman/ama_with_angel_versetti/drc18kg/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ambrosus/comments/7jkman/ama_with_angel_versetti/drc2bx2/)


**#3 The CEO’s own words as seen** [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ambrosus/comments/7mp7lj/i_am_overall_optimistic_about_ambrosus_next_year/)

When he’s talking about bullshit in this industry, I think he’s talking about all the FUD/misconceptions happening in the market and just how much some projects *“go up”* based on smoke and mirrors. Putting aside *“crypto opinions”* and focusing on the real world business development it is very clear Ambrosus has built themselves a fortress with partnerships on a national level, and extremely strong and competent team [read their bios here](https://ambrosus.com/#team) and are set up not only for an explosion of growth in 2018 but designed to weather any future turbulence by being one of the elite ICO’s people can point to and know they’re solving real world issues with a clear product vision/traction shown. 


**#4 Book value calculation.** There is zero speculation and minus subjective value baked into their marketcap. What do you think a partnership with Nestle or Migros or any of those $300B+ companies are worth? Well, Modum announced a partnership with a $5B revenue company for sometime in Q1 2018 and their price doubled overnight (Congrats MOD holders it’s well earned)


**#5 A f-ing Warchest at their arsenal.** A continuation of book value. So they raised ~$35M at time of ICO. Now their book value is ~$246M. Where is that money going? Intended proceeds were: 35% R&amp;D Protocol and Ecosystem (which would have been $12.25M and now is worth $56.35M so a net gain of $44M and 25% for Pilot Projects/Partnerships and Integration into Supply Chains (which would have been $8.75M but is now $40M so a net gain of $31.25M) [sourced here.](https://blog.ambrosus.com/amber-token-allocation-intended-use-of-proceeds-d6a34b7a62f1) And of course partnership/outreach/intergration which is another whopping 109M yet to be used.


They’ve already tripled their team (and are still hiring). They just opened a research lab in Lausanne Switzerland (Jan 2018). They just hired a Chief Marketing Officer who I imagine will hire even more people underneath her. Angel has shown through comments in his AMA he is now taking marketing/awareness very seriously alongside business development (their focus in 2017 was Product Development, but now they have this war chest to also build Product Development and awareness). He’s extremely growth oriented and understands business logic. I also know he reads these forums and is likely aware of this market anomaly (but legally cannot comment on it, nor should he anyway because his focus is on Enterprise Bus Dev/ecosystem development etc).


More catalysts incoming: Clearer token economics will be unveiled to us this quarter. Partnerships will likely start to come in. Marketing infrastructure being built by the CMO I imagine will start to tip awareness towards Ambrosus in the right communities and people will follow with their money. Oh yeah, their protocol v.1 and first Dapp is being revealed very soon (Vlad their CPO is at a conference this month and I speculate it may come in then).


I am known for writing long posts, but these are the key takeaways I want you to leave this post with. To learn more about Ambrosus please visit r/ambrosus and search top posts all time. There is in-depth research/analysis and literature as all the top posts. You now know my thought process on some of this *“subjective”* value Ambrosus may have. And let’s remember, a true price of an asset SHOULD be: Book value + “Subjective value” = Price. We know their Book value is $246M and their price is $161M. What do you think their subjective value should be? -85M? Me, I think it’s a helluva lot more and these reasons stated are just the beginning. I’ll just say it because I believe it and know it to be true so the elephant in the room is this: This makes zero sense and I believe they're worth multiples higher than what the market is reflecting this moment. Ambrosus has yet to have any top posts on Reddit penetrating the r/cryptocurrency or r/ethtrader - I plan to crosspost this in both forums because I believe research and analysis that can help us all learn more about quality projects is WORTH sharing because good projects like these can get lost in all the other ""noise"" happening in this space. In other words, the overused ""cliche"" of being a hidden gem is actually applicable here. Their forum/community has started to show growth this last month but I believe this is just the beginning of a multi-year journey. So please, if you believe this to be true as well I encourage you to do your part by sharing/commenting, and of course continue helping to grow our vibrant community!

I have some questions. How do end consumers claim tokens as the whitepaper describes? That would involve the rfid being modified after scanned as purchased, which would require hardware at the stores not there yet? What about the token burn? If items aren't claimed by consumers, those tokens would be burned? So with food, you'd have alot of the tokens burned very quickly if consumers aren't participating with claiming. So the token burn would come to an end at some point less the company run out of Amber tokens?

I am being lazy not having read the whitepaper yet.
Are there nodes and any kind of staking minimums? Can we run nodes in the future?

What's the purpose of the this using blockchain? If it was open source code and still centralized, wouldn't that still be good enough? You could still use smart contracts to verify authenticity with an open viewable ledger? It's not like Switzerland is going to shut down their operation, they're pretty free over there. There planning on being used by centralized businesses and organizations, so it's not like blockchain would help if it wouldn't be used. Their wouldn't be incentive to maintain the network without them.

**Step 1:** Create an account on Binance and register with Google 2 step authenticator.

**Step 2:** Send ETH or BTC to your Binance account (I suggest using ETH as it generally has lower fees). You can find your ETH wallet address by clicking: funds &gt; deposit &gt; and search ETH.

**Step 3:** Once your ETH or BTC has been transferred to your Binance account, search for AMB in the Basic Exchange tab and put in a buy request for either the current lowest sell price (this will be an instant buy) or set your own price and wait for the market price to drop.

Two that come to mind for me:

1) building off of the coffee pilot project, I think a similar project/microinvestment program with durian farmers in SE Asia (Thailand, Malaysia) could be very successful, considering the immense demand for durian in Hong Kong and China. Could also help facilitate/further Ambrosus' introduction into Asia.

2) Vlad's blog post mentioned product recall off the cuff. I think this has serious potential too - Ambrosus has solidified the intention to track foods farm to fork, and pharma from production to patient - why not extend to tracking from factory to fully assembled machine, especially in the event such products have similar environment concerns as food and pharma (temperature, moisture, movement, air pressure, etc.). For specific products, maybe chemical production or specific, historically troublesome mechanical parts, tracking within the Ambrosus ecosystem could cut out a huge swath of inefficiency and provide increased protection in the event of product recall.

Sometimes your left with no choice but to respond, but not when its a rival pre-ICO company. Your response to them is no better than their misinformation. You make claims about them trying to sell their staff and hows its only worth 3-4mill. You back it up with nothing. Its FUD and bullshit until you can prove it, the very thing you were trying to push back against. Don't get dragged down to this level

Here is Binance CEO responding to John McAfee FUD
https://twitter.com/binance_2017/status/961666467325358081
They are polite, they don't try and bad mouth him all they do is provide the information to disprove him

Make no mistake your ONLY tool to fight against any FUD or misinformation is the facts that you can provide to the contrary 

Don't feed the trolls

On a similar note, there are no mentions in reddit about this that I know of.

As the end consumer in a supermarket, there are two things that I will care about. How can the Ambrosus app simplify/add value to my life and why should it matter to me to know all about the data?

Let us use the humble olive oil for this exercise:
1. How will I know which brand of olive oil carries the Ambrosus QR code?
2. How can I filter out which brand of olive oil uses Ambrosus so I can quickly have a reference when shopping?
3. I don't follow the news that much. How can Ambrosus be up-to-date on current food scandals and fraud in the media?

I think the first step is developing a search engine for a list of all olive oil brands that use Ambrosus. This will narrow down a lot of guess work on the consumer side. This list can also be available on the website. 

The app will also benefit from featuring a “favorites” so that me, as the consumer will able to quickly know which brand to buy whenever I go shopping. On a macro level, if Ambrosus has a partnership with a retail company, this will complement with individual suppliers. For example, an app search for a particular retailer can bring up a list of all the food and brands that use Ambrosus. 

The third point is media awareness and the why. All the data may seem impressive but as a consumer, why is this even important at all? I believe the app can benefit in spreading awareness on the cost of food fraud, counterfeiting, and safety. When searching for olive oil, for example, a little FYI section or “fun-facts” can be included as to how the industry is rife with counterfeiting and why this is detrimental to the consumer. The benefit is two-fold. A feedback loop of awareness gives honest suppliers a marketing incentive to use Ambrosus that their product is legitimate. In turn, consumers can expect a growing list of products that use Ambrosus, thereby the app will add more value to the end consumer.

But then I found Ambrosus today and I’m ecstatic! I read the whitepaper and a couple of other articles on their website right away and believe I’ve found the token I’m looking for. However, I haven’t found a good answer to the question in the title. I want to make sure I understand as many high-level details as possible before investing so here I am.

Is there any incentives built in the protocol for adopting these hardwares and use them correctly? Even if a device is approved, I imagine we still need to trust the producers to use the hardwares as intended. So there is quite some room for error and fraud? A reputation system might help but needs to be way better than just customer review. Maybe a built-in incentive using Amber token would be even more effective?

To enter the contest, people needed to follow WTC on Twitter, retweet the contest tweet, and tag a friend.

I thought this was a great marketing move for a few reasons. First, it increased the amount of twitter followers for WTC (I know it got me to follow them). Second, by having people tag a friend in the tweet, it increased awareness for the project and brought in new buyers (for example, the friend I tagged ended up buying some WTC). Third, it was a pretty fun contest that got people excited and talking about the project. 

I think in the future it would be great if AMB could do something similar.  AMB is a great project with lots of potential, so anything that brings awareness to the project is beneficial in both the short term and the long term.

Anyways, that’s my two cents. I look forward to what the future brings for AMB. ",NA,"7y3b8l",NA,0,NA,"false",1520550664,"false","self","t5_3mh72","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/ambrosus/comments/7y3b8l/marketing_suggestion/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

The initial idea I had was to embed peizoelectric gps trackers into Rhino horns and store the data on a publicly available ledger (There is already research in progress for such devices, see link below). Having this data in a public distributed ledger will go a long way towards making sure corrupt officials can not tamper with it. Rhino horns and ivory are big business and the bad guys have fingers in every pie. This makes it very difficult to follow the trail to the top of such organisations.

The same technology would also be very useul in other areas of ecology. From tracking smaller game like Lion to monitoring plankton, currents, movement of plastics in the ocean etc. The best part is that the data would be safe. With recent events in the USA where public climate data has been pulled offline it makes sense that we start storing this data somewhere safe where it cannot be tampered with.

I see good things coming out of Ambrosus and I am looking forward to seeing where it goes.

Edit: For Rhino a GPS data on the ledger may need to be encrypted or at least if the animal is known to be alive be stored at quite a wide resolution to avoid data being used for poaching.",NA,"7y76wt",NA,0,NA,"false",1520553588,"false","self","t5_3mh72","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/ambrosus/comments/7y76wt/ambrosus_for_game_and_ecological_management/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

What is the economic model AMB will use? I've researched this project a bit a few weeks ago, and one theory is that AMB will have to be purchased by customers to interact with the blockchain. I have also read that they might use a node model similar to VeChain, apperantly this was hinted at by the CEO during an ama. 

My memory is a bit blurry as I have read these posts a while ago, I apologise if im completely off base. 

Is there a concrete path that they have chosen or is it still up in the air? If they haven't chosen which direction they will go I'm sure they have people working on the economic model as we speak. Are there any hints? What do you guys as AMB investors think they will decide? I know that would be pure speculation. 

Also, has the two coin model (yes similar to VeChain) come up at all?

Firstly, I did read up on ""Condition-Oriented Programming"", that you had given in the acknowledgements. 

**Few observations** 

 1) Contract code layout and contract inheritance hierarchy definitely makes for good readability . I liked that Agreement, Insurance, Market, Measurements, Parties contracts have been organized  in their respective folders.  

**Was readability and clean organisation the only objectives behind this? Were there any other criteria for the same?**

2) ERC20Token logic is in a separate file/contract, and the main contract implementing the same invokes it with a wrapper function using ""super"".    

**I would love to know more such references to such clean patterns! Either general design guidelines or patterns!**

3) Some contracts like ""Parties"", ""Measurements"" basically define functions which ""MeasurementsOnChain"" &amp; ""MeasurementsOffChain"" implement.
Apart from obvious logical structural breakdown &amp; readability, does this style serve any other purpose?  

**I read in your blog that Ambrosus envisions that a lot of dapps will eventually depend on core network protocols. Was that the only design rationale here? I would love to know more** 

4) ** What does defining ""Agreement"" as an empty contract achieve? **

This is inherited by two other contracts ""DeliveryAgreement"" &amp; ""EscrowedAgreement"" 

5) ** I would love to know a little more on the thought process behind your contract design!! **

**Step 0 would probably be functional processes** ie,

1) User can create marketplace, create item listing, buy item
2) Item has IoT data which can be stored off-chain/ on-chain
3) Delivery handles different states of the item delivery ""progress/complete/cancelled/reimbursed""

**Step 1 could be** 

 Might be identifying that 
a) Agreements can be of different types
b)Iot statistics off-chain/ on chain needs separation

**Step 2 could be** 

Could be separating util contratcs, ERC20 contracts and changing all conditonal logic to function modifiers. 

and so on. 

**I would really, really love to know more about the thought process behind which you arrived at the final code!**

Personally, I found Modum first, Ambrosus after (by accident in a reddit comment). This needs to change if we want to gain the attention from the cryptocurrency community.




I suggest we, as current investors and as a community will propose suggestions in this thread to give the AMB board our take on this matter. Everyone has a take on the project and it would be great to centralize all of the opinions and ideas and grow as a community as well.



I'll start off with my observations and opinions, these can be different from yours, so please remain civil in the comments below. I'm not an expert by any means. I encourage you to share your observations and opinion.




Observations

- Currently marketing is non-existent, most of the communications are through channels which only investors / people who know about the project follow (ex. twitter, medium, blog, website, reddit).

- Great fundamentals: the project consists of a team of pioneers, people with a big amount of experience. A bunch of NDA's, research and development with big marketleaders, masternodes confirmed (launch march/april if no legal issues), AMB net launching (feb 26). Great involvement with the already existing community, daily update, videos, it's amazing. Unfortunately almost no communication to the outside world about all of these developments.

- Modum: I'll state it again: THIS IS MY OPINION. The ambrosus idea and team beats the modum team by far. However, Modum is targeting a specific niche so I see no reason for them not to be able to co-exist. Modum is no competition (for now).

- Vechain: Both teams hold a hefty amount of pioneers, vechain is making moves in Europe and has done a lot to market their project, in contrary to Ambrosus. Vechain is competition and currently taking all of the attention away.

- Wabi: Weak team, did not do extensive research on it yet, maybe someone else can fill me in.





Marketing ideas

- Targeted Reddit advertising (reddit ads: competition subs, general subs)

- Twitter advertising (influencers, twitter ads)

- Blogs (medium, independent websites, buy article on coindesk, etc.)

- Google (adwords, youtube vids, mailings)

- Sponsored cryptocompare mailing

- Buy top spot on cryptocompare price list

- Coinmarketcap ad (not good reputation however) - can expand to onchainfx, bitscreener, coingecko

- Educational program like RSK, independent events

- Etherscan ad

- SEO articles 

- Partnership with high ranking project 





Marketing content

- Great fundamentals (masternodes will bring in big investors, market it right)

- General fundamentals about the goal of the project. Carefully push the idea that Ambrosus is better than the competition by carefully wording your ads. Should be no issue considering the many fundamental factors at play here. NDA's, big company name like Nestle can work great in terms of marketing, even if its ""just"" R&amp;D.





Price opinion

If marketed right Ambrosus should have no issue growing to at least half the size of vechain marketcap. (13x USD value)

&gt;But the majority of Masternodes will be hosted and operated by our customers and key partners. Once the stability and integrity of the system is established, the opportunity to host a Masternode will be offered to Ambrosus’ broader community.

...

&gt;AMB-NET is a distributed network of IoT sensor software, comprised of [initially] a few dozen Masternodes. 

...

&gt;As AMB-NET adoption grows, more companies will want to host their own masternodes to reduce the cost of using Ambrosus. We plan to put a system in place that allows Masternodes to have an internal auction every year. This way there will be an open auction where companies bid in cash, how much they’re willing to pay to the network.

What does ""pay the network"" mean?  Does the money go to the Ambrosus company or to token holders?  The latter I guess in more tokens.  

It seems like the emphasis is on customer masternodes using DPA.  Will there ultimately be more token holder master nodes than customer nodes?  

The roadmap says ""the majority of Masternodes will be hosted and operated by our customers and key partners"", but I wasn't sure how long it's envisioned to stay that way.  I think a lot of tokenholders envision running their own masternode for some sort of reward/dividend system.  

Looking forward to seeing the full crypto-economic model of Amber.  Nodes, dividends, number needed for master, the prior reference to cold staking, etc....

The overall roadmap &amp; goals looks great by the way! Solid work so far.

I have two questions regarding the use of Ambrosus that are still not fully clear to me after the research I have done in the Amber token in particular. 

The first question is what happens to the tokens at the end of the supply chain traject, in the whitepaper it indicates that a portion of these token will not be claimed and ""burned"" while it comes across as if the other tokens are released to customers, but this might me my own misinterpretation. What happens at the end of the supply chain to the used tokens? 

The second question, this is more from the perspective of the users of the token within the supply chain. What happens if the token price becomes so expensive due to a high interest of outside investers increasing the value of the token, would this mean that the users are using a portion of the token or are they still using a full amber token which could be of high value. If there is a high amount of tokens moving through a supply chain with a hypothetical price of 1000 dollars, what would secure these tokens from not be sold on exchanges by users in the supply chain? 

Could anyone help me with the confused state I am in? Furthermore, I would like to say that I am very interested in the idea behind the technology and very intrigued in the potential impact on the supply chain and logistics industry.

1) Roadmap was a high-level overview of AMB-NET only.
2) There will be a separate update about tokens and masternodes. As well as a separate update about sensors from Stefan's team.
3) We are not rushing information on masternodes or token economics because it's a **very** sensitive legal issue. I hear that tokens/coins that are wandering into security realm and/or don't offer a specific functionality within the blockchain/platform have heaps of legal trouble with regulators, who are becoming quite aggressive. Ambrosus prides itself in our strong relationship with the public sector stakeholders and thus we will wait until our legal/compliance strategy is 100% solid and unbeatable and then we will share token economics. We are also doing a few things in the background to strengthen the resilience of Ambrosus, so that it would be developed and built irrespective of regulatory risks in any jurisdiction, but we have to walk carefully and we hope the community understands this.
4) the biggest tokenholders are team, partners and early backers of Ambrosus, and the tokens are locked. Everybody who participates also gets future allocation of AMB. Please take note of these facts. I cannot legally comment on the implications of this, but you can make your own conclusions about incentives mechanism and alignment of interests.
5) We are watching your proposals for masternodes, and you are welcome to send further suggestions to the team, we also monitor what the community is saying.

I don't work within the supply chain, i design the tools and components, but i do work very closely with supply chain, recently over the last few years there has been a large influx of much cheaper steel being produced by various countries. While its cheap, it has its downsides. It generally doesn't last the length of time expected, sometimes has a higher total failure rate. Now these problems generally are attributed to poor production. 

In terms of production, metals have the same high standards that food and pharmaceuticals have, they are very environmentally sensitive a few degrees in any part of the process can ruin a whole batch. It can become far too brittle or it may not have the required strength or a number of other reasons.

I've first hand witnessed cases where entire batches of products have been rendered useless due to certain people short cutting parts of the process costing millions upon millions. This is just my own experience there will be many others the same within this industry

Have you ever considered trying to branch out to these places outwith food and pharma. There are many, not just steel. I can tell you now if you can save them money they will be interested.

I am Adam and, as you all here, I am a big supporter of the Ambrosus project. They say, don't marry, to a coin but what can I do, when I see a hard-working team, so dedicated to success. I want to apology for my poor english (if you are unable to read something or understand I am sorry) but I am not a native speaker, I am constantly learning. 

For a past few days, I have seen, both on Reddit and Telegram group, a lot of fantastic things from the team. Encouraging your community to be a part of token economic is something amazing. There are a lot of smart people here, only waiting to help you. So, listening to them is a very good move. Open-source spirit is something that has been moving forward all the greatest projects. Gather together smart people and just let them think together and discuss.  

To be honest, I am not a tech guy. I learn a lot but it's hard for me. So I won't help with token economic. I also don't have any graphic-designer skills, nor video making. But what I can do is telling the stories. 

Crypto is all about people's believes. Their convictions about: how big the project is going to be, how much price would go up, etc. Sentiment. 

Ambrosus is facing some problems. As some guy mentioned, we are still belove ICO price, our competitors (or other similiar start-ups) have bigger communities. Well, now think about it - what is the best way to interest people? Tell them a good story. 

In a few months you (amb team) will be posting about things like masternodes, token economic and other things. It will probably be done in a very proffesional, interesting way. But, what if you would do something bigger. Something that will really interest people. And do it better than the others. Better that Ven, better than Mod etc. New level in crypto marketing (and also it would give a lot of fun!).

**Introducing: Prometheus Project**

I really like the idea which stands behind Ambrosus name. Ambrosia was a food of greek gods. We should stick to this theme, becouse it's very good. Expand it as much as we can. I divided a whole project into stages. Prometheus, the Greek's Tytan, created the people from clay and gave them a fire, so they can prosper and develop. So as him, Ambrosus will give humans a better solutions to live longer by eating better products. 

**1. Introduction:**

* This is the beginning. Stage in which we do a lot. We need to create a whole story.

* Promotion videos (good examples of the form of the films: [TedED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_u91SjrEOE) and [Kurzgesagt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ)

* I also thought about creating some riddles for community to solve or something, but I need to think more about it

 *Story (the most important thing of our project) - creation of something we want to present to the community, it can be a fictional history about Ambrosus, Prometheus, greek gods, legends etc. Good examples of creating stuff like that (good stories): [1st link](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_PL/region/mount-targon/) [2nd link](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_PL/champion/annie/) [3rd link](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_PL/region/ionia/)

* Also some hype would be needed :P

**Stage 2 - Creation of the man**

Stage in which Ambrosus team will reveal a whole token economic, and migration to their own blockchain.
Also: more stories, riddles, mysteries, and more to come with that.

**Stage 3 - Fire for human kind**

This is an idea about second token (if you decide to make it) - Nectar (or Nektar). Ambrosia is a food of gods, Nectar is a drink of gods. You create another story, marketing around it, previews and so on. Also: need to think more about it. 

**Stage 4 - Progress of civilization**

In this stage you present masternodes. Idea is the same, a lot of mysteries, riddles, stories, greek gods, graphics, videos etc. Present it as best as you can. 

**Tiers** - only an example 

* First tier: Artemis - goddess of the trees, animals, hunting, forests (it goes very well with AMB vision) - 50 k tokens for MN

* Second tier: Demeter - goddess of agricultur and harvest - 25k tokens for MN

* Third tier: Gaia - personification of the Earth - 10k tokens for MN

I thought about numbers of tokens for each MN for a while. Now' it isn't a lot of money, but when AMB will go even 100% up, it would be a lot of money. So maybe even less tokens should be needed?

**Stage 5 - Atlas system**

Simple dividend system for all Hodlers of the AMB token. You can deploy and lock-up your tokens into network for a period of time to get a reword in future (good example is a NEO system with a GAS or Metaverse system of token lock up). 
Atlas held the whole world on his shoulders - so as a small hodlers and investors keep network and project on them, and are a big foundation of AMB-NET

Okay, that's all for today guys, I will write a lot more about it in the future, right now, after a few hours I am freaking exhausted, I have put a lot of effort to write it and translate with a help of a dictionary :P Please let me know what are your opinions about that idea. I think that, with some effort we could make something very big and interesting, the story that the crypto world has never seen before. 

**Bonus** - some slogans for AMB marketing: 

* Treat yourself like a god, use Ambrosus

* Greek's gods converted ambrosia into Ambrosus. You should too.

* Greek's gods converted ambrosia into Ambrosus. Now all the mortals can use it like gods. You should too

* Ancient greeks dreamt about drinking ambrosia. Today, we have Ambrosus, and it's for us all.

* Eat like a gods, trade your food with Ambrosus

* Greek's gods ate ambrosia for eternal life. We have Ambrosus.",NA,"80qmc5",NA,0,NA,"false",1520605813,"false","self","t5_3mh72","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/ambrosus/comments/80qmc5/ambrosus_community_idea_prometheus_project/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

And I want to be reasonable about this. Downvote me all you want. 

Many people in the community are attacking Mr. Versetti for his post. Mind you it was just a link. Let's do some critical thinking here: 

1) This sub-reddit has been filled with questions all about ""how is Ambrosus different from Modum?"" ""How is Ambrosus different from VEN?"" etc. etc. mainly from lazy investors who don't want to do their own research. And guess who ends up having to answer their questions all day? You guessed it, Mr. Versetti. 

2) So what happens when a clear cut instance of the difference between Ambrosus and Modum is caught on camera? It is a worthwhile moment to post about. And I think that a lot of you are missing the point: the video starts with the Modum COO's answer but after that answer Mr. Versetti himself speaks about the difference between Ambrosus and Modum (for those of you who are always asking how Ambrosus is different -- there is your answer!). 

3) Mr. Versetti did not comment on anything regarding the situation. All he did was just post a link, with a copy of the exact words spoken by the Modum COO -- so anyone alleging that the post was provocative or false, would not be correct. Watch the video yourself, the words are in his mouth. 

4) This is the AMBROSUS subreddit. Is the CEO of a company allowed to post a quotation from a video in his own subreddit? Hell yes! Why wouldn't he be? This is not the Modum subreddit. His post didn't actually say anything, it was just a link where he answers a question that he has been asked a lot. 

5) His answer and point are TRUE. We can say relatively objectively that the Ambrosus project is more comprehensive, developed, and well founded than Modum. Anyone who wants to dispute that, will have to have read all the documents from both Ambrosus and Modum, and I am 99% sure that almost none of you have done that -- and if you have, PM me, we can discuss what values you are using to draw your conclusions. 

6) The fact that the Modum COO couldn't give a distinction between his company and one of its main competitors in Europe really shows where the incompetence lies. Now, Mr. Versetti did not SAY or COMMENT at all to indicate this incompetence (which he could have done), rather he made that clear with pure facts.

I hope these reasons made some people think a little bit and reconsider their initial reaction. Comments and discussion are welcome of course. 

Best, and hopefully with some reports coming in the future to clear up all this slander.

This is from a piece written by Professor Malcolm J W Povey, some of his acoustic, non-contact food sensing developments are particularly interesting.

*Source* https://blog.ambrosus.com/food-reassurance-and-blockchain-transforming-food-supply-chains-by-prof-malcolm-povey-38d50a12e0c6

&gt; ""We envision deployment of multiple sensors integrated into a mass-produced platform integrating measurement, data analytics, artificial intelligence and capable of monitoring all stages in food distribution""

The above vision is something that everybody involved in this space should be aware of. 

However, the significance comes here:

&gt; ""All elements of the platform are at least TRL (Technology Readiness Level) 5 and a number of elements are already commercially available.""

TRLs, originally developed by Nasa assesses an emerging technologies readiness for use and adoption. 

Graded as Follows:

*  TRL 1 - 3 Research 

*  TRL 4 - 6 Development

*  TRL 7 - 9 Deployment

The fact that **all** elements of the platform are determined to be **at least** TRL 5 (Pilot Scale: The technology is undergoing testing at small to medium scale size in order to
demonstrate specific aspects of the design) further backs why so many large companies are already interested in what the Ambrosus Ecosystem can offer. I would be reasonably sure that many of the suppliers and vendors are already actively involved with assessments of the hardware and connectivity to the available network.

Let us not forget the scope of what the team is attempting to achieve.

Eagerly awaiting the announcement of some of the smaller NDAs. 

Hope this provides some useful information.

As we are discussing with different stakeholders on cryptoeconomics of Amber, we are also interested in the feedback/opinion of the community. What elements would you like the cryptoeconomic model of Amber to have?
Post your replies. The authors of the most upvoted proposals / solutions will win AMB.

Key questions we would like your feedback on (although you are welcome to propose your own comments):

1) are you in favour of burning AMB? Why? Why not? In what way?
2) would you prefer a lower stake in AMB for a masternode with a legal contract on use to sign? Or would you prefer no contract, but a high stake of AMB to run a masternode?
3) are you in favour of two tier node system? (Masternodes + peer nodes)
4) are you in favour of snapshot system or similar to reward those who maintain the integrity of the network by staking tokens long-term?
5) given that corporate partners wish a stable price of tokens for the services rendered, would quoting the prices in fiat currencies and converting them to AMB at spot-market rate make / not make sense? Why?
6) free market transaction fees (ethereum style) or fixed transaction fees for Ambrosus Blockchain?
7) would introducing a second token (stable token, or non-tradable AMB which is 1-to-1 identical to AMB ERC20 in terms of ownership) make sense?
8) is guaranteeing stable price for services on Ambrosus Blockchain (volume of data recorded + volume of processing) in fiat and pledging to constantly and gradually decrease the price of a certain service in AMB a good idea? (Saying that one transaction will cost 5 cents but 0.01 AMB today, 0.009 AMB in 1 month, etc). What are the pitfalls?

We are now testing different models in our environments and getting different inputs / feedback from different stakeholders. We would also like to hear the community's inputs / thoughts on this. We will take these into consideration as we prepare the release of cryptoeconomics model for Ambrosus in spring.

Looking forward to your inputs. Share widely. The more people provide inputs - the better.

The US produces an excess amount of crops, such as grain, and so in response to world hunger we send 'food aid' to countries that need the food relief. However this food also represents power, both for the US and the recipient. The US provides a party of their choosing with something of value in the form of food, and in turn the recipient is more or less indebted to the US, who now benefits from an increased influence over the party. The recipient obviously wields power in their nation state because they now control a considerable amount of food supply in a country that desperately needs it. They're now responsible for the distribution of the food, and therefore possess power.

Once the transaction between USAID and the recipient is complete, that food is essentially untraceable. So in summation, we provide parties with something of great value in what tend to be corrupt and unstable countries. Logic suggests that those in control of the food would not always act in the best interests of the entire population, but rather utilize the food as a mechanism of power- which is exactly what happens, as they choose how and to whom the food is distributed.

The inability to track how our food aid is distributed is a major problem. I'd imagine that this presents one of many instances where the implementation of Ambrosus could act as a perfect solution.

Side note: The entire system is subsidized by US tax payers. There are many more flaws with the current food aid system, where I think Ambrosus would be able to bring about significant change. Currently, world food production is monopsonistic, wherein Cargill &amp; ADM control 75% of global grain trade, and the entire food aid system is designed to allow companies such as Cargill &amp; ADM to reap profits. It's also not limited to just food, other foreign aid programs such as antimalarial drugs are perhaps more susceptible to corruption.

Some sources/interesting reads:

&gt; Millions of dollars worth of antimalarial drugs provided by the U.S. government are being stolen and resold on the black market in Africa, according USAID’s office of inspector general, which monitors the agency. The U.S. government fights malaria in 19 African countries through a program called the President’s Malaria Initiative.

&gt; In January, the inspector general’s office reported that an investigation it launched in the West African nation of Guinea led to the arrest of eight people on suspicion of illegally selling USAID-issued antimalarial drugs in public markets of Conakry, the country’s capital. U.S. funding for combating malaria has exceeded $72 million since fiscal year 2011 and amounted to $15 million in fiscal year 2016, according to the office.

http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-global-aid-true-false-20170501-htmlstory.html

&gt; Looking at a sample of developing countries between 1972 and 2006, economists Nancy Qian of Yale University and Nathan Nunn of Harvard University found a direct correlation between U.S. food aid and civil conflict. For every 10 percent increase in 
the amount of food aid delivered, they discovered, the likelihood of violent civil conflict rises by 1.14 percentage points.

http://foreignpolicy.com/2012/06/18/please-dont-send-food/

&gt; Research demonstrates that food aid can be poor value for money, especially when food grown in donor countries is shipped to the developing world. Sorghum shipped from the United States is 200% more expensive than it is in Chad and almost 100% more than in Sudan, according to Development Initiatives calculations. Despite this, the United States and Japan continue to make extensive use of food shipments.

http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/09/opinion/where-does-aid-money-really-go/index.html

&gt; CARE and Catholic Relief - who rank first and second in money raised through monetization - say they recover only 70 to 80 percent of what the United States paid for the commodities and shipping.

&gt; ""What's happened to humanitarian organizations over the years is that a lot of us have become contractors on behalf of the government,"" said Odo of CARE. ""That's sad but true. It compromised our ability to speak up when things went wrong.""

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/14/world/americas/14iht-food.4.7116855.html

TLDR: The current food/foreign aid system is extremely flawed and ultimately corrupt, such that it contributes to political inequality and allows companies such as Cargill and ADM to reap profits at the expense of tax payers, with minimal benefit to the intended food aid recipients. The introduction of Ambrosus would bring about transparency and fix a flawed system.","","81uaqk",NA,0,NA,"false",1522427461,"false","self","t5_3mh72","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/ambrosus/comments/81uaqk/obvious_use_case_for_ambrosus_food_aid/","","",NA,"","",0,0

People keep saying fire sale, buy the dip etc. But data says otherwise, when the market recovers (BTC green candles) we hardly move an inch in comparison. The downtrend is strong with AMB and hardly anyone is trading it. Basically the price is being dumped on. 

I think this tells us that we only have a bunch of holders who have accumulated “enough” and that we aren’t attractive enough in the cryptocurrency community to invite new investors. 

In crypto what seems to gauge public interest are partnerships, recognition from reputable figures in crypto and so on. Yes we know about SCA (swiss coffee alliance), but i guess the community would much prefer commonly heard names or large corporations. I wonder when AMB will disclose their NDAs or when they may expire. Also I’m curious on how the UN discussion is going, and how are the token economics coming along.

**Ambrosus is completely compliant against Swiss’ laws and THIS is a big benefit (please continue below to know why). During the TGE, every single of AMB was distributed under the KYC process.**

I am late to the party so I was never part of the TGE, but I have managed to get a relatively large amount of AMB tokens. I have gotten those from an unverified account on Binance, so the exchange only has my IP address.

Will there be another KYC for swapping to native amb-net tokens when the time comes? Or will there be a seperate KYC for those of us wanting to set up nodes? I doubt Ambrosus would want unverified masternodes on their network.

To clarify, I don't have any issues going through the KYC if needed, I just want to know if I'm SOL for not having been part of the TGE.","","88hk8h",NA,0,NA,"false",1523410139,"false","self","t5_3mh72","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/ambrosus/comments/88hk8h/kyc_and_lawregulation_compliancy/","","",NA,"","",0,0

1.) The whitepaper said Amber tokens would be recycled back into the ecosystem, but one of the diagrams also said that unclaimed tokens would be burned. By burned does that mean destroyed indefinitely and the number of tokens will decrease? Or burned as in ""wiped clean"" of data and put back into use to track/monitor another product.

2.) The whitepaper said that a single Amber token can be ""broken up"" to track multiple aspects. Does this mean that a single amber token can be used to track one item for various parts of its supply chain? Or that a single token can be broken up and used to track two different products, from two different companies?

3.) Currently most of the tokens are not in circulation. Anyone know when the rest of the tokens plan to be released? And potentially to whom (companies, exchanges)?

4.) Any insight into the valuation of a single token? For example, on one end of the supply chain, you have a company that is shipping a bulk shipment of milk, they purchase/use Amber tokens to track their shipment, so I am assuming it will be either a fairly large fiat value to do this or it will take lots of Amber tokens. On the end of this supply chain though, you have Bob, and Bob just wants to check the information on one carton of milk he wants to purchase so he doesn't get bad milk. So if one milk is 3$, and he needs to purchase the token (or part of a token), it has to be at a very small fraction of the price relative to what he is buying. So how does the price of the token information stay consistent on both ends of the supply chain? And will more expensive items have an increased token price to get information (i.e will the token cost be based on a % of the item value?)


5.) Kind of connected to #4, does anyone know if it will be possible to “rent” out these tokens? So say someone owns 1000 tokens, they rent the tokens out to a company for a fee, the company tracks their item etc, consumer buys tokens to get item information, and then the tokens are returned to the initial owner for future rental.

Contaminated raw ingredients and products were always a HUGE problem and a constant battle for us. We spent a lot of time and money trying to find good raw chemical suppliers, and even when we did all of the chemical analytical testing would need to be re-done because some of them would faking the certificates of analysis and poor quality control measures were common even among the best companies.   
   
So yesterday I was looking for a prenatal vitamin for my wife, and I was doing my due diligence to ensure that she would get something safe. Now that I’m outside of the industry and don’t have access to internal testing and that information isn’t available to the public. I ended up going with a prescription prenatal because I couldn’t find a SINGLE manufacturer that made their quality testing information available publicly. The information is SOMEWHERE, it’s just not accessible to the consumer.  
  
If I could have just gone onto the Ambrosus marketplace and chosen a manufacturer, or been able to go to a manufacturers website and been able to verify their supply chain data via Ambrosus technology it would have literally saved me hours of time and a ton of money not having to buy a prescription prenatal that costs 10x more than the over the counter type. Even when I was still in R&amp;D, if we had an immutable and trustless record of the supply chain/quality control measures I can’t even tell you how many MILLIONS of dollars we would have saved having to re-do expensive chemical analytics.   
  
This is the type of thing that makes me very confident Ambrosus will succeed… there’s a huge hole in the industry just asking for the technology Ambrosus is offering.

Here’s how I understand it, as illustrated by a below example ( I understand that each case will vary).

&amp;nbsp;

**1.** A broccoli farmer sells his crop to a supplier/packaging facility.  In the process of packaging this facility attaches a measuring device, whether that’s RFID, a QR code, or something else.  The processing facility then attaches an AMB to this measuring device, for this example let’s say it’s 1 AMB per package, and that 1 AMB=$1.  So they ship out 50 packages, mark up the shipment $50.  

&amp;nbsp;

**2.** The buyer, a grocery store, receives the items, pays the premium and stocks the shelves.  The buyer doesn’t have any direct interaction with any tokens or ecosystem, they just put it on the shelf.  

&amp;nbsp;

**3.** A customer buys the package after scanning the RFID/QR label and sees the temperature and location history.  

&amp;nbsp;


Where does the AMB go?  
After it’s sold to the final customer, does it return to the supplier who packaged it?
To the grocery store?  does the customer get to keep it?  or is it simply burned? 
Is it best to have the only direct interaction to the ecosystem in this case, just with the facility that packages it?  I don't see a need for the grocery store or farmer to have any interaction at all in terms of purchasing AMB.

&amp;nbsp;

1) contact some of Youtube cryptoreviewers to see if they are interested in endorsing AMB ( lot of people blindly follow their suggestions)
2) maybe some kind of competition, personally I think it's great way to promote a coin, for example Vechain made huge profits from binance competiton, when people see huge volume they will research coin and possibly conlude to invest
3) although I like idea of blog maybe consider doing videos on YouTube about AmbrosusAMB, people will much easier get what is about when they see presentation and not just read some strange words

EDIT : Since AMB CEO appreciates community opinion we should also make an effort and you are all welcome to give an ideas how to promote AMB.

I had a few questions if people can help me out:

1. I know AMB is a side-chain of ETH. So it's technically not a token (or will not be a token of ethereum) in the future?

2. Will it ever have its own separate blockchain like WTC or VEN? 

3. What are the staking options in the future? I saw PoA, but don't quite understand it. Is it correct to say that only masternodes will be able to stake and receive passive income? EDIT: ...and smaller token holders get no income?

4. Are there plans (if they make their own blockchain) to ever offer comprehensive enterprise solutions via dApps or sister chains. I have concerns over ethereum scaling issues.

::Ambrosus is developing the next generation blockchain-based supply chain Data Management ecosystem which will enable seamless interoperability and transparent but access-controlled data availability on demand for various cross-organizational applications. We are building an open ecosystem that will provide hundreds of thousands of developer use cases.
 We are also creating the next generation of sensor systems, smart packages and tamper proof sensing technology. For more details refer to https://www.reddit.com/r/ambrosus/wiki/index
2. **Ambrosus is surveying the batches. why would a seller implement such a potential risk in revealing their products arent handeled correctly along the supply chain? isnt it like shooting their own leg?** ::
Ambrosus provides value for each element in the supply chain. For the farmers and manufacturers it provides better communication with the consumer, easier product recall, more efficient monitoring of customer satisfaction levels, and significantly improved quality control. This could provide a huge competitive advantage for businesses. Your question assumes that companies do not want to improve their own product quality, which is a false assumption. If we provide companies with the tools to improve quality and provide better customer trust and satisfaction, it is a win win for all.
3. **What is the use case of binding data to amber tokens? couldnt data just be written down in protocols and accessed through private keys?** ::
Juxtaposed to conventional protocols,Amber token  is unique in the sense that whilst locked to a product Amber becomes its non-reproducible digital identifier - i.e. as long as all data pertinent to the lifecycle of such product is continuously recorded and stored on the blockchain Amber token serves as the only means to unlock and access this data. Once the lifecycle of the product within the supply chain is over Amber token will be liberated of the product data and released back into the token pool.
4. **For whom and why is it important to survey products? who benefits? explain me please how benefits are made**::
As has been explained in our FAQ, https://www.reddit.com/r/ambrosus/wiki/project#wiki_what_are_some_of_the_possible_applications_that_can_benefit_consumers.3F
An open, transparent, while at the same time secure and access controlled data ecosystem helps every stakeholder. Though there could be infinite use cases through infinite apps, some of the main ones are listed. The farmer benefits because he can forge the relationship of trust with his buyers and thus market his products better. Industries benefit from better data management, easier compliance, saving costs in manufacturing processes through better operations management, better communication with consumers. The consumer benefits with more choice, and more quality control over the food and other products he consumes.

5. **How exactly ambrosus simplifies processes for producers and consumers along supply chain? an concrete example would help.** ::
Through numerous ways as illustrated in an example. A consumer buys a cake, and when he reaches home he finds that it has a fungus. He realises there is an ambrosus tag attached, so he downloads the ambrosus app, and scans the QR code. The entire supply chain history is tracked. He can even make a complaint through the app with a picture of the fungus…. The manufacturer directly sees the complaint and can automatically track where the batch was produced. He checks for any problem in production system but cannot find any problem. But the AMbrosus tracker shows that the shipping truck had a non functional air conditioner and was parked in the heat for 30 hours. The problem is identified and corrective measures are taken.
The consumer can communicate directly with the factory and is awarded a compensation. The Supermarket would normally have to face consumer complaint , but the supermarket is happy that it does not need to take responsibility for fault of shipping truck. The supermarket would prefer more products to be tracked by Ambrosus and thus recommends it to other manufacturers.
6. **What will a dna detecting sensor cost?** ::
There are no in line DNA sensors available today, and hence it's too early to determine the cost
7. **How can you clearly confirm me that the united nations is interested in your solution to make food and medicine more safe? the reddit post with excel spred sheet is not enough.** ::
The highest alignment of interests in the sphere of sustainable food system building coupled with the availability of a sophisticated technical solution to the majority of supply chain problems makes Ambrosus an important strategic ally to 10YFP. Ambrosus was honourably invited to present the vision on transformation of global value chain via adoption of blockchain at the Global Food Conference of the United Nations in Pretoria, South Africa - this is the unprecedented level of recognition of a blockchain project within the institutional domain.

8. **Todays databases of supply chain transfers are too big and thus confusing and might not be transparent. since amb is blockchainbased it will be transparent. explain me the value of transparency please.** ::
Transparency means the ability to trust that the data logged on the system has not been manipulated by any party. In question 5 we illustrate an example where the reason for a defective cake was the transportation. But transparent supply chain would ensure that all stakeholders can see it, the consumer, manufacturer and the supermarket. Because all are affected by the issue. Blockchain allows for that trust to happen and thus enables easier trade and supply chain communications.

9. **I'd like to ask what approach might they take in order to attract companies that are considering going via the private blockchain route vs public one, such as Ambrosus, in search for their supply chain solutions? For example; Starbucks with their project to bring transparency to the sourcing of their coffee beans. Why would Ambrosus benefit corporations over the private route?** ::
The key advantage here is our open App Development ecosystem. This means a large number of stakeholders can build their own customised solution with the ambrosus open source code at the core, more competition, more use cases , greater adoption.. As has been seen in so many industries open systems often scale much faster. Take the example of Hilton Hotels vs Airbnb. We have a similar analogy here.

10. **Do they figured out staking mechanism, rewards, how much Amb would be needed to stake? When we can start staking Amb?** ::
Our first priority is to get the developer tools out and get developers to develop useful applications that get adopted. We need a secure AMB-NET network. However staking rules and masternode related info will be published with our cryptoeconomic model in Spring 2018.

11. **What their competitive edge is to the new IBM blockchain ready sensor for tracking food etc?** ::
As explained in question 10, there is a space for private applications, but we believe that only open-for-all app ecosystems are destined create entirely new value for supply chains. The same reason Android proved much more successful that closed mobile OS.

In a world where we have too many spineless ""leaders"" who are afraid to speak up publicly, I am sending one message publicly: **We do not turn away from those who helped us in difficult times when they have difficult times. When I promise someone my support, I mean it.**

Ambrosus moves ahead with actions, not words. Anyone who believes we are scam should come visit us either at our offices or at one of countless public events we attend. Otherwise, if there is nothing to say, I would ask those people to disappear. I have instructed our mods to be more unforgiving to disinformation and spread of panic.

Angel is a passionate and unabashed visionary, and Ambrosus is his baby. Aside from the striking physical resemblance between a young Steve Jobs and Angel, I think they shared very similar personalities and the same mentality towards realizing success. 

Some Steve Jobs quotes that I think are relevant to both Angel's leadership style and Ambrosus:

&gt; Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They’re not fond of rules, and they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify and vilify them. About the only thing you can’t do is ignore them because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as crazy, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.

&gt; I’m brutally honest, because the price of admission to being in the room with me is I get to tell you your full of shit if you’re full of shit, and you get to say to me I’m full of shit, and we have some rip-roaring fights. And that keeps the B players, the bozos, from larding the organization, only the A players survive. And the people who do survive, say, ‘Yeah, he was rough.’ They say things even worse than ‘He cut in line in front of me,’ but they say, ‘This was the greatest ride I’ve ever had, and I would not give it up for anything.’

&gt; I’ve always been attracted to the more revolutionary changes. I don’t know why. Because they’re harder. They’re much more stressful emotionally. And you usually go through a period where everybody tells you that you’ve completely failed.

&gt; My job is to not be easy on people. My job is to make them better. My job is to pull things together from different parts of the company and clear the ways and get the resources for the key projects. And to take these great people we have and to push them and make them even better, coming up with more aggressive visions of how it could be.

&gt; The secret of my success is that we have gone to exceptional lengths to hire the best people in the world. And when you’re in a field where the dynamic range is 25 to 1, boy, does it pay off.

&gt; We are aware that we are doing something significant. We’re here at the beginning of it and we’re able to shape how it goes.","","87wpyo",NA,0,NA,"false",1522372452,"false","self","t5_3mh72","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/ambrosus/comments/87wpyo/food_for_thought_angel_versetti_and_steve_jobs/","","",NA,"","",0,0

I´m currently conducting research for my Masters dissertation which will be critically examining blockchain in terms of its potential to promote sustainable development through the implementation of fully transparent supply chains.

I am currently a student at the University of Sussex studying an MA in Environment, Development and Policy and with Sussex being no.1 in the world for Development Studies we therefore receive a lot of exposure from the developmental world, which is why I would love to include Ambrosus as a prime example in my dissertation.

I was therefore wondering if it would be possible to conduct an informal interview with one of your employers, ideally in person.  The purpose of the interview would be to gather some insight into the political economy of supply-chain management and the steps being taken to effectively adopt blockchain. This would therefore allow me to critically assess its socio-economic impact on both consumers and local producers, but also its wider potential in sustainable development.","","846frx",NA,0,NA,"false",1522299128,"false","self","t5_3mh72","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/ambrosus/comments/846frx/how_do_i_get_in_contact_with_ambrosus/","","",NA,"","",0,0

I work in a group that specializes in characterizing biologics such as vaccines etc. A problem we and other labs suffer from is tracking what we test, when it was tested, insuring those test dates are correct, data is stored and easily obtainable (especially if audited by the FDA) and knowing what particular lots and vials etc from those lots/batches. Generally this is handled by a laboratory information management system (LIMS) but these differ across companies and sometimes are even specially built by certain companies. This doesn't include tracking those samples that were sent to us from another country which means both sides need the same info in case we are both audited. The testing usually is performed on specific validated instruments using certain validated consumables. This obviously leads to part of the fragmentation problem blockchain is trying to solve. Even trying to track specific tests such mass spec purity, LC identity tests and so on and so on can be too much. Could these sensors be used in a way to automatically write to the blockchain documenting all important information for that day? 

Could Ambrosus also integrate closely with a medical records blockchain to prevent problems such as this: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pediatrician-arrested-for-giving-partial-doses-of-vaccines/
We hope that things like this do not typically happen but we all know it does. It seems like a doctor could pull a vaccine with a unique identifier, that is scanned and added to both the medical blockchain and Ambrosus. If that same identifier were to pop up on different patient records that could send a red flag and potentially catch problems like this before hand.

I know that may have been a lot to read and may be part of the plan at hand for Ambrosus but in my mind it seemed like a potentially interesting use case. But what do I know. I'm just some dude with a keyboard.","","811hjf",NA,0,NA,"false",1522235988,"false","self","t5_3mh72","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/ambrosus/comments/811hjf/potential_use_case/","","",NA,"","",0,0

And using blockchain to track production process from farm to fork is honestly the first adaptation of blockchain tech that I would deem as usefull right now. 
I do not have a suggestion, but more or less a few questions.
 
1. How does your solution fit within the currently standardized HACCP system ? does it work within its scopes using same control points or do you want to completely replace it?

At the moment i think a huge improvement would be if there was a way to tie existing measurments to a blockchain to enable effective transparency with already implemented control systems.

2. How do you approach the question of adoption, have you partnered with any organization that oversees standarization like ISO? 

3. the main issue i have with put a chip on your food icos like VEN and AMB is that i can see it working in luxury goods market where the cost of packaging does not really matter. when you are putting a budget or a acceptable cost product on the shelves of a chain store every cent matters. What is your prediction of cost increase of final product if rfid chips and sensors are incuded in the supply chain ?
have you partered / spoken with any company that would oversee sale and buyback of such chips, like it is done at the moment with standardized pallets and other equpment.

4. how do you see implementation of your system with current providers of IT services and solutions for food industry (usually on country level), that include tracking and implementing standardized control ?  do you see the current vendor lock-in, as an obstacle? e.g. a company has a 5 year contract with an IT solution provider, who refuses to implement your system. 
Will you provide a basic solution for manual input of measurements so that technology can be tested without investing into chips and special sensors, at some point of development?

Other than that I am fairly thrilled to see  such projects in an industry that has been stuck in the 90s for the last 20 years :)

In every thread about Ambrosus outside this sub the lack of sources is one of the first things mentioned. So I decided to do a little digging and this is what I found.

[This is the site](http://web.unep.org/10yfp/take-action/global-scp-clearinghouse) for the United Nations Environment Program. The 10 year food program(10yfp) is one of the many initiatives that the UN has taken for a sustainable future. 

The link above takes you to the page describing SCP(Sustainable Consumption and Production) clearing houses role in all of this. It's described as: 

*""the role of the Global SCP Clearinghouse, which serves as the official information and knowledge sharing platform for each of the 10YFP programmes""*


Now with that said, if you do a site search of SCPclearinghouses website for ""Ambrosus""  by typing into the Google search bar:


site:http://www.scpclearinghouse.org/ ambrosus


One result appears and it's a link to a spreadsheet. Under the ""partners"" tab you'll see Ambrosus listed in row 67.




So there it is. I wish this was easier to navigate and we could package it into a bit more palatable source but this is what I got. Ambrosus is an official partner and they are the first block chain partnership affiliated with the UN. I hope this will be enough to dispell some of the FUD or maybe someone here can find a direct link that isn't a spreadsheet.

To me this is not an enormous part of the project however, I appreciate the team value every minute detail; it is what Ambrosus preaches, so we must practice the same also. 

Personally I think the font and theme doesn't suit the project. The initial indigo and white theme presents a much more clinical front to Ambrosus and better fits the company image and vision. I believe it would suit the Amber Journal heading space also. 

As previously stated, this is not a vital component but I believe there is room for improvement.

I am new to Ambrosus and have a few questions. First of all I like your Roadmap for 2018 very much. It is clear minded with no frills. The point why I have questions is only due to my little understanding in blockchain technology. So lets start.

1.) How much is AMB-NET a product of your developers? I saw that the underlying Blockchain is Ethereum. Can I understand AMB-NET as a modified ETH Blockchain fitted on Supply-chain?

2.) Why didnt you create your own Blockchain?

3.) Will AMB Token allways be an ERC20 Token?

4.) Is the Ambrosus Staff able to create a blockchain from scratch?

5.) When AMB-NET is running, will it be dependent in any kind on Ethereum?

6.) Why shouldnt potential custumers of yours use ETH directly?

It is hard for me to get this questions on point. But i hope you can help me with well versed answers.

-Internal Inventory Management App

-App for farmers to tag their produce prior to shipping

-App by insurance companies to calculate premiums based on data feeds from Ambrosus.

All of these sound cool on the surface but i'm failing to see any truly revolutionary cost savings to businesses (I'm not an expert on supply chain by any means so excuse me if i'm missing something obvious).

Check out the website linked under our CTO Dr Stefan Meyer:
http://mhmmicrotechnique.ch/lift/

If you look in the ultrasonic counterfeiting area, you'll see mention of a technology that uses bubbles to create a unique ""fingerprint"" within a tag. 

""Innovation in the counterfeithing area

MHM has developped a special Tag which cannot be counterfeited. it is based on the creation of a bubbly structure through its natural process.
The fingerprint of ultrasonic spectroscopy is taken during manufacturing and kept has attached picture for each piece of equipment. Each piece has
a unique fingerprint allowing the differenciation in a similar way as for humans.

The strongness of the method is based on the uniqueness of each Tag which are created under a natural process and no software can copy or re-manufacture it.

The entire concept is patent pending""

I would imagine that generation of such tags could be extremely cost effective compared to other RFID methods.  I'll definitely stay tuned for further developments.

-	Deflation of the legal timber industry

-	Indigenous people displaced

-	Destruction of habitat to wildlife threatening extinction 

-	Protesters murdered every year

-	One of the biggest contributors to greenhouse gasses globally ( more than Air, Road, Rail and Shipping traffic combined )

It’s a global problem that affects forests around the world from Russia to the Amazon. There are laws in place to combat this, preventing the sale of illegal timbers. The bottom line is forging a bit of paper to say these logs were legally felled is all too easy. Obviously this is where blockchain can step in providing solid traceability of timbers. Easy and fast access to information on the timber, all the authorities need to do is scan a chip or code and you can instantly verify the legitimacy of the wood. This type of technology can put a huge dent in the sale of illegal timbers across the world and help towards slowing deforestation
Ambrosus have already demonstrated their want to change the world for a better place, improving the drugs and food industry ultimately saving lives. I’d argue that deforestation has a much bigger impact than what food and pharma has upon saving lives and it’s not just human lives either.

A few number to go with this

 - Estimated to be around 15% – 30% of all timber traded is illegal

 - The trade in illegal timber is estimated to be worth around 50 – 150 billion USD annually

Maybe some of you know me as I have written two reports on Ambrosus, maybe not. I just read through some of the recent posts on this subreddit, and I want to clear up some things about how people talk about Ambrosus (to use this going forward as well). 

Its amazing the bullshit you see against members of the Ambrosus team. Half the time people who have bought into the coin, attack the CEO of the company because they don't like his behavior. The other half of the time they are attacking some tweet or some promotion in the social media space as being 'unprofessional'. If you were watching this like a movie you would think the investors are some spoiled little kid who just screams when he doesn't get his way. 

Let's do a reality check: First, one thing has stayed consistent about the CEO of Ambrosus from the very beginning. He is a straight shooter. What that means is that he says what he thinks, and he does what he thinks. And he tells it as he sees it and doesn't mince words or stay silent when he feels he shouldn't. 

Second, many investors need to learn their place. I don't think I can stress this enough. The level of childishness and absolutely stupid questions make me think that quite a few people who invest in Ambrosus have no idea what they have invested in. So to help those of you who are confused let me give you some tips: BEFORE you post something stupid, and before you criticize, READ ALL of the documents about the Company and LOOK in the subreddit history to get some of your questions answered. Furthermore, don't ask stupid questions: When will the NDA's be released? -- well they will be released when they are released, as they are a non-disclosure agreement. 

Third, for those of you who are too lazy to look at what you have invested in, here are some simple facts to remind you to keep your mouth shut, until you have read more:

First, Ambrosus is partnered with two universities in Switzerland, and has multiple Professors (academically reputable) on their team. 

Second, Ambrosus has partnerships with the United Nations, and will be holding a Panel with the EU Commission in Brussels soon. 

Third, Ambrosus is designing their own custom-made sensor laboratory (in partnership with the university), and has close connections with many companies in Switzerland and the European Theatre. 

Fourth, the company is less than a year old. Give them some breathing room: possible expansions that may be in the pipe-line in the coming years are things like the Halal market in the Middle East (untouched by any other major supply chain company), Expansion into the meat and fish industries, and movement into the United States supply chain market. 

Here is my final point: Watch the team, look at their background. Don't scream scam, FUD, or whatever is fashionable to scream. WATCH and be PATIENT. 

Cheerio.

Ambrosus has a number of documents on its website in addition to its whitepaper going over topics in greater depth such as their sensor technology (with a great example of a fish tracking/quality monitoring system), specific use cases, and business opportunities (e.g. insurance, loyalty rewards, farmer fund). There is some great information in these documents, everyone should look through them! They can be found here: https://ambrosus.com/#tech-docs 
This is very uncommon in the crypto world. I take it as another sign of a very smart, thoughtful team. Not sure if everyone knows about this already, thought I'd share just in case. Ambrosus seems to be combining a lot of big trends (IoT devices recording data directly to the blockchain) to tackle an enormous problem (lack of information about food and medicines as they move through the supply chain).

You are probably wondering what it means. HODLTRADER is a person who daytrades coins he plans to hold for a longtime. 
In my modest opinion I mostly make good decision and I did increase my holdings through daytrade/swingtrades.
Almost every coin in my portfolio... EXCEPT MY FAVORITE- AMB!
I HATE it because every time I make a move AMB does opposite of what I was expecting...And now looking it at 6K I can't stop wishing it rapidly falls down to 3-4K range so I can finally increase my holdings.

•	Mr. Versetti has clarified that the Masternode model will be multi-tiered. However, more details concerning this model will not be released until the EDCON conference in Canada around May 5th (https://kryptocal.com/event/18214/token-economics-release). One benefit of this setting is that there will be experienced representatives from the industry present who can give quality feedback when the model is unveiled. 

•	The newly hired CMO (Chief Marketing Officer) is Mr. Stephen Croncota. Mr. Croncota was previously CMO at Versace. In his talk with the audience Mr. Croncota stressed his desire to make Ambrosus more well-known, and emphasized the importance of transparency and honesty. 

•	Throughout the talk Dr. Vlad Trifa and Mr. Versetti stressed the power of keeping Ambrosus open source. They discussed how the revolutionary changes Ambrosus will bring to the food and pharmaceutical industries are often times difficult for current companies to accept (i.e. Monsanto), however, especially in terms of demonstrating quality, Ambrosus will be essential for companies wanting to demonstrate their authenticity (the example was given of Asian companies who will have the opportunity to use Ambrosus to demonstrate a European Union level quality of their products). 

•	Dr. Vlad Trifa also was very keen to emphasize how the Ambrosus NET registers ‘events’. What this ultimately means is that not only food, or medicine can be tracked in the Ambrosus system: but rather, any asset that may require an ‘event’ so as to be assembled (i.e. Car Parts) will also be eligible for Ambrosus tracking. 

•	Mr. Versetti discussed a couple of real use cases for Ambrosus. Most importantly, he mentioned a company (currently under NDA) but valued at around 22 billion. As well as two other companies: one valued at around 2 billion and the other in-between 2 to 4 billion. His use cases were the Chocolate and Coffee industries. 

•	A key question asked was about possible expansion and geographical location. Mr. Versetti stressed how Ambrosus already has more than enough opportunity in Europe, however a lot of European countries assemble their products (or get their produce) in Asia. On a different point, Mr. Versetti stressed the importance of engaging with both public (i.e. government) and private actors so as to ensure that certain import-export or tariff barriers are taken into account. Finally, Mr. Versetti discussed the partnership with the UN Sustainable Food Program and put the call out for any company working with the program in developing countries to get in touch if they desire to. 

•	One final general point is that both Mr. Versetti and Dr. Trifa were very keen to emphasize how Ambrosus will be compatible with many other systems in the blockchain and IoT space. The Ambrosus project is ultimately planning for the long term: smart cities, more complete blockchain adoption and open source participation, etc.

SO as far as tracking humidity, temperature, light exposure, tampering etc these sensors could provide some great data while tracking that data on the blockchain. Now, in my humble opinion, the real big hitter would be implementing this tech with existing legacy tech from vendors who supply majority of the instruments etc to pharma and food currently. The data is out there it just needs to have more visibility. For example, certain companies sell chromatographic columns with ""intelligent chips"" to track column temperatures, methods used, number of injections, dates used and so much more when performing QC tests of pharmaceuticals. Another example, I heard of a company who had issues with ELISA plates from a trusted vendor, come to find out the humidity in their facility changed effecting the plates and results obtained. This was discovered but obviously took more time than if the data was available on a public ledger for investigators to see. There are companies tracking this data already so would it not be simpler to just take their data and put it on the blockchain?

Is Ambrosus thinking about attempting to integrate their tech with the current vendors out their who have a strong hold on the market already with investments from so many pharma companies?

""The first Video contest submission was by Eric Ha (https://youtu.be/S5RGH7a6B2Y). Despite being a cute animation, which we appreciate, it could not be considered for the first video award since it did not present an innovative business use case.""

 Despite its simple appearance, I spent hours creating a video on what I believe is an innovative idea that's useful for the general public. There are comments on the video asking for such an app proving that it's both useful and innovative. You may have been searching for ideas that weren't targeted at the general public or end user, but that was not specified. Also, by not recognizing this idea as a qualified contestant, it is limiting what Ambrosus considers is innovative for the end user, especially when they already expressed an interest for such an idea. 

I delivered with a video that showcases an innovative idea that has not been done, is extremely useful, and is desired by the end user. I believe these positive points should qualify the video for ""first video"". I understand that title has been given already, but I respectfully ask that you reconsider allowing one more ""first video"".","false","8e59ln",NA,0,NA,"false",1529627126,"false","self","t5_3mh72","false","",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/ambrosus/comments/8e59ln/video_contest_unfairly_judged/","t3_8e59ln",NA,NA,"","",0,0

So since Friday's live streamed session in Berlin and the AMA I've noticed that there's not been a huge amount of excitement surrounding the newest member of the team, the CMO - Stephen Croncota. I thought that I'd offer some information on why this is a VERY ambitious and POSITIVE step forward for Ambrosus and all associated with it in the community. 

I only personally caught wind of the fact that the CMO prior to Mr. Croncota, Elena Yunusov had left her position a little while back and so therefore was aware of this situation, though I appreciate that others perhaps weren't informed and so seeing a new one introduced may not have been news that they were expecting - so perhaps this attributed to the relatively underwhelming response.

Nevertheless, it only takes a five minute search on Google to see the repertoire of Mr. Croncota is not to be sneered at. Listed as previous positions that he has held include (and not in chronological order):

""Mr. Stephen Croncota serves as the Chief Marketing Officer of Haggar Clothing Co. Mr. Croncota served as the Chief Marketing Officer and Executive Vice President of Game Show Network, LLC. Mr. Croncota served as the Chief Marketing Officer of Glam Media Inc. He served as Head of Worldwide Marketing for Versace in Milan, Italy. He held the positions of Senior Vice President and Worldwide Creative Director for Turner Broadcasting and Warner Bros., Senior Vice President of Marketing for E! Networks and Director of Marketing for Details Magazine at Conde Nast [Vanity Fair, Vogue, GQ, Pitchfork, Wired, etc.]. Mr. Croncota served as the Marketing Director for the launch of Conde Nast's Details magazine.""

Needless to say, this guy has got experience in some of the biggest brands in the world across entertainment, fashion, luxury, wine &amp; food &amp; advertising. Everyone is well aware Ambrosus' vision is a hugely ambitious one and so making sure that star players are added to the team is of the upmost importance if they're to realise this. With someone with the type of background like Mr. Croncota's I think we are in good hands in that regard as he has a wealth of insight that he can bring to the table. 

This could be just what's needed to communicate to those within and outside of the cryptosphere the benefits that Ambrosus offers to the pharma and food industry and attract the attention it merits. His track record certainly hints so.

I'll sign off with an apt interview of Mr. Croncota:(http://www.fashionwelike.com/my-work/stephen-croncota) as he details what skills are necessary in his job role and what he's felt he has learnt in his years of working for such an array of big names.

Good work team!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kdfWffAn6E&amp;feature=youtu.be

Ye, a supply-chain consultant specializing in reverse logistics, entered the winning submission, titled “Perfect Recall”: A reactive and decentralised application designed to solve some of the food industry’s most glaring problems.

Specifically, Ye’s solution addresses the $40-billion-dollar-per-year scourge of food fraud and the menace of contamination, as 10 percent of the global population fall victim to food poisoning annually. In fact, the World Health Organization estimates that 420,000 people die from foodborne illnesses every year.

While Ambrous’s AMB-NET core is a proactive and preventative supply-chain solution, the platform’s malleable and scalable architecture enables developers like Ye to create reactive enterprise applications that seamlessly integrate with the network. 

As such, Perfect Recall iterates over Ambrosus’ proactive technology, which seeks to eliminate the risk of food supply-chain contamination before it reaches the consumer, working backwards and improving incident response “once an outbreak actually occurs.” 

Ye’s dApp works like this: When an outbreak happens, the system sends out an alert that enables producers to track the compromised shipment in reverse, charting every step of its logistical journey. From there, producers can also track associated foods that were in close contact with or exposed to the contaminated product.

What this means is that manufacturers and distributors will now be able to pinpoint with sniper-accuracy the exact products and packages, where contamination occurred and the supply-chain transit point where quality control failed.

So instead of having to pull an entire shipment, an inefficiency that causes an average $10-million loss for food enterprises, Perfect Recall can still help producers moentise uncontaminated supply-chain components. Additionally, Ye’s dApp can help enterprises weed out incompetent or malicious counterparties from their distribution network.  

The upshot is that  Perfect Recall could help food enterprises save millions and mitigate the impact of adverse media coverage in the event of a Chipotle-scale catastrophe.

However, Perfect Recall would not be possible without AMB-NET’s Application Enablement Platform (AEP) and blockchain-native REST Application Programming Interface (API), which enable any web developer with basic code knowledge to iterate over our network.

Even by distributed-ledger technology standards, Ambrosus’ platform is disruptive because this AEP and blockchain-based REST API combination makes AMB-NET dApp engineering accessible even to those who lack formal blockchain coding expertise. For programmers, this translates into lower development costs and a faster time to market.

Relative to other decentralised supply-chain architectures, the developer-friendliness, ease-of-use and intuitiveness of the Ambrosus network represent a unique value proposition for the ecosystem. With open-source innovation at the core of our DNA, Ambrosus has actively been nurturing a dynamic community of young developer talent.

The hackathons we recently hosted at two world-leading technology institutions — the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich) – are testament to this. And next month, Ambrosus will sponsor a hackathon at the IoT Blockchain Camp in Valencia, Spain, taking place from April 11th to April 15th.

I'm really fed up of reading people whining about Ambrosus CEO's public behaviour. Ambrosus is Versetti's creature. Ambrosus is Versetti. Versetti is not a typical CEO. He is a very special and unconventional CEO. We all have learnt that he's arrogant, rude, insolent, irritable, impudent, bad-tempered, impulsive, impetuous, not diplomatic, rebel and so on. But he's also highly skilled, visionary,  determined, very strong, powerful, straightforward, forward-looking, resolute, effective, transparent, unflexible, strict, uncompromising, coherent, responsive, attentive, devoted, merit-appreciative, hardworking, etc, but above all he gets the shit done and this is what really matters in this space full of scammer CEO's. He is like that and will never change. So please make your considerations and make your own decision once and for all. If you don't like Versetti then you don't like Ambrosus. So sell your AMB tokens and move on. Full stop.

I like what Angel said in the interview, about trying to forge a long term relationship with the big pharma and other companies. We need AMB to be a player that's around for 5-10+ years not just a speculative coin riding off hype. That's when the big money will get in

is angel, with his recent incendiary comments, simply playing 27-d chess by shaking out the weak hands before big-time moon mission news comes out? BULL SIGNAL

His posts really got me into AMB, and it's a shame and quite silly he deleted them. Nonetheless, I am still holding a large amount of AMB. Here is a repost of my original post on AMB (it is from two months ago so some of it may be dated):

For those of you that may have not got in early with Vechain, I want to introduce to you the next Vechain. Ambrosus (AMB) is similar to Vechain and Walton Chain, but is focused on the food and drug industry. It’s current market cap is $120M, and I’m going to tell you what it does and why it’s one of the best buys in crypto right now. 

-

**What Do They Do?**

-

The goal of AMB is to track food and drug from the beginning to the end. It not only tracks origin but quality as well. AMB uses RFID like Vechain, but what makes them different is they will be using IoT sensors. The sensors will track temperatures, chemical composition, PH levels, light, potency/quality, etc.

-
[Here is a more detailed explanation from their CEO]( https://blog.ambrosus.com/ambrosus-in-a-nutshell-62a8bf40b60e)

-

The food and pharma industry are clearly massive industries with issues with data, quality control and tracking.

-

**Isn’t this what Modum is doing?**

-

First of all, both are great projects. Just like WTC and VEN can co-exist, so can Modum and AMB. Modum is focusing on transportation and phama specifically, and growing from there. I believe they are building with IOTA. The point of their tokens are more so just shares.

-

AMB is building their own ecosystem, including their own blockchain. They didn’t find the right solution whether from IOTA, Eth, or any other platform so they are building their own. This gives them the opportunity to enter pretty much any industry they please. The tokens will be used to track products through the supply chain and also pay for services.  The ecosystem will also allow for API access, allowing open ended custom solutions. 

-

**The Team**

-

Now this is where we get into the good stuff. Everything here on out is what sold me. Everything about AMB checked all my boxes for a good investment.

But here are the two best parts of the team.

-

1) They just hired a new marketing manager…. That’s why you haven’t heard anything about AMB up until very recent. They’re going to be looking into even more partnerships and getting their name out even more.

-

2) They have an active and interactive team. Check out http://np.reddit.com/r/ambrosus , the developers and even the CEO are active in the subreddit. They know the importance of being there for the investors and they are engaging and answering questions. I personally emailed the lead developer and he answered me back a couple hours later.

-

**Partnerships**

-

Partnerships in this industry are one of the most important things. Why? Because partnerships are needed for successful adoption.  They simply need massive companies using their product or the whole project will fail. Here is what I believe the reason is for AMB not already being atleast a $2 coin and $500M market cap. Non-disclosure Agreements (NDAs).

-

AMB currently has 20, yes 20, NDA agreements with other companies. And it’s not little unknown companies, some of the companies are absolutely massive. Because of the NDAs AMB can’t release the names, but they’ve given info about the size of these companies. Let me give you an example. Recently Vechain released huge partnerships with PWC and DNV GL. PWC does $38B/year in revenue and DNV GL does $2.9B. Both, huge! Now let me put into perspective how big the AMB partnerships are, because if people knew, this coin would be significantly higher.

-

**NDA 1** – Chemical and commodity producer: $100B annual revenue! This is one of the biggest partnerships in crypto.

**NDA 2** – Good manufacturer: $30B annual revenue.

**NDA 3** – Food and retail goods producer: $25B annual revenue.

**NDA 4** – Cosmetic manufacturer: $4B annual revenue.

**NDA 5** – Food processing equipment manufacturer: $2B annual revenue.

-

That alone is over $160B in annual revenue. When these deals are released AMB should really take off.

-

But that’s not it.  AMB is also in talks with Nestle and they really like AMB’s tech. Now nothing is confirmed but it is still great news. Nestle does $90B annually. The AMB team also has ties with Nestle so hopefully that helps their chances of landing this partnership.

-

They are also in talks with Migros, a huge Swiss grocery store franchise with over 1000 stores and $40B revenue annually.

-

On top of all that, they already have numerous confirmed partnerships and pilot programs including one with the United Nations and some government partnerships in Switzerland. No partnerships yet, but guess which other companies are based in Switzerland? Roche and Novartis, respectively the second and fourth largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. The potential here is exciting.

-

AMB is currently redoing their roadmap and updates will also include a new website, the opening of their R&amp;D lab, updates on pilot projects, and new partnerships announced.

-

**Market Cap and Price Predictions**

-

Currently the market cap is only $120M which is very low, especially for the partnerships they have already made. Like I said, I think because the names aren’t known people don’t fully realize the significance of these partnerships. There’s no reason this can’t take a similar path as Vechain. At this time it’s 87 cents. You could triple the price to $2.60 and the market cap is still only $360M, which is still very low, and that could just be the beginning.  Vechain went from $0.25 to $8.00 in the matter of a month.

-

**Who Am I, What Is My Opinion Worth?**

-
I’m copying this from a post I made on HPB. At the time I made the HPB post it was $4 and went up to $13 before the market dumped.
I read forums and research coins literally 12+ hours per day. I don't want to toot my own horn but everything I've got into has turned to gold. I usually pick bad exits or I'd be a multimillionaire by now lol.

-

BTC - $30

IOTA - $0.79 (Held for months before selling before it blew up)

NEO - $8 (More at $35, have sold since)

Loopring - $0.035 (As mentioned got in because of NEO partnership, have sold since)

Ripple - $0.77 (Tripled my money and sold)

Tron - $0.0022 (Sold most of it, it's now up 50x from initial investment)

XLM - $0.27 (Got more at $0.65 which took a dip since)

WTC - $1.40 (Got scared by FUD and got out though)

[Got in VEN and ENG two weeks ago.](http://np.reddit.com/r/Vechain/comments/7l73xx/this_is_crazy_im_in_lets_go/). Vechain was $1.50 at the time, I bought at ATH because I knew it was a great project. I said this will be over $5 in no time and should be even at $10, that was me being conservative. We're now at $7+. ENG was $2.90 and we were at $8 yesterday.(at the time I wrote this)

-

Here are some private messages I've received in the past week alone, and it's an absolute honor to receive them knowing I've helped people make some money. I currently receive 5-10 messages per day either asking advice or thanking for past advice.

-

&gt;Man, I am a newbie inside the sphere of Crypto, but have been following you since the day I got into this. I have seen you being extremely sharp and correct in terms of opinions on specific coins and your crypto portfolio (LRC as a really good example).

-

&gt;hey bro i know this might be random but browsing thru reddit i came across your trx post about a month ago, bought a nice a amount indirectly thanks to you. just want to say thank you and keep those updates coming.

-

&gt;Been lurking Crypto and always see you....we typically agree, but you're usually way earlier than me on a coin. 

-

&gt;I've been following your moves lowkey since Tron was at .009 lol you been killing it lately, keep it up for me hahaha.

-

&gt;Hey, just wanted to say I've been following your posts for awhile and you're pretty spot on. you've helped me make some money. Anyone coins you got in on recently or interested in?

** Final Note **

This is just my well researched opinion. Never put in more money than you can afford to lose. We never know where this market is going. Every now and then I get a good feeling about a company. I do my research and it if it ticks all my ‘boxes’, I invest.

&gt;  Our recent engagements with a large British pharmaceutical company, a large German quality assurance firm, a large Swiss food retailer and a range of other diverse stakeholders has allowed us to get a deep practical understanding on what the expectations and needs are on their side vis-a-vis a system such as Ambrosus, and this likewise adds another dimension to our cryptoeconomic model.

From the recent interview:

&gt; We work right now with, one example is a large pharmaceutical company- it's one of top ten global pharmaceutical companies... we'd rather work with (them) a bit more and prove that our technology is good and then we'll make a proper partnership announcement...we're trying to win them as a longterm technology partner.

&gt; Developing proof of concept and demos, fully fledged partnerships...collaboration with two of the largest companies in the world in their sectors- one of them is a large consultancy firm, one of them is large pharma, another one is a large quality assurance firm. All of these are multibillion dollar companies. With all 3, the collaboration is already confirmed, we are just waiting for a good moment to make a proper announcement

I think there is enough information to identify the 3 aforementioned partnerships.

* A top ten global pharmaceutical company

* Large British pharmaceutical company

Assuming the companies being alluded to are one of the same, this is **GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals** (GSK), a British-based pharma company that ranks as the 6th largest in the world in terms of annual revenue ($42 billion).

If he's alluding to two different companies, then the large British company could also be AstroZeneca, whom Ambrosus recently spoke alongside at LogiPharama.

* A large German quality assurance firm

* A multibillion dollar company

This very well could be **SAP**, a German-based software company that also specializes in quality assurance and boasts an annual revenue of $23.5B. Ambrosus has also reiterated that the network will have software integration to SAP. Furthermore, Ambrosus' Strategic Advisor, Oliver Bussmann, has served as CIO at SAP.

This connection is based on the ""multibillion dollar company"" depiction. Another possibility could be SQS Software Quality Systems AG, also a German-based company but with annual revenues of $327 million and a market cap of $270 million.

* One of the largest consultancy firms in the world

Assuming this to be one of the 'Big Four', it's likely **Deloitte**. At LogiPharma, Vlad recently led a workshop with Deloitte's Managing Director on innovation in pharma supply chains.","false","8cs6hk",NA,0,NA,"false",1529602250,"false","self","t5_3mh72","false","",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/ambrosus/comments/8cs6hk/connecting_the_dots_identifying_3_of_the_nda/","t3_8cs6hk",NA,NA,"","",0,0

today I was browsing this etherscan page \(top 100 AMB holders\) [https://etherscan.io/token/tokenholderchart/0x4dc3643dbc642b72c158e7f3d2ff232df61cb6ce](https://etherscan.io/token/tokenholderchart/0x4dc3643dbc642b72c158e7f3d2ff232df61cb6ce)

and there are couple of things which I don't understand and I would greatly appreciate If someone would be able to clarify it for me. 

Here are my questions:

1. I assume that the first wallet \(containing 25&amp;#37; of all AMB tokens\) is for Partner Development Pool, according to this definition about token allocation \- [https://blog.ambrosus.com/amber\-token\-allocation\-intended\-use\-of\-proceeds\-d6a34b7a62f1](https://blog.ambrosus.com/amber-token-allocation-intended-use-of-proceeds-d6a34b7a62f1) . Where are the other wallets \(or wallet\) containing the rest of the locked tokens? How can we be sure, that the locked tokens are indeed locked and are not being used/traded? 
2. The second largest AMB wallet is containing 50 million AMB tokens and is actively sending transactions \([https://etherscan.io/address/0xfe9e8709d3215310075d67e3ed32a380ccf451c8](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfe9e8709d3215310075d67e3ed32a380ccf451c8)\). Who can it be? It is owning over 4.5 billion in assets. And it doesn't seem like an exchange to me. If you thing about it... 50 million of 144 million are held in one wallet...

However, for the newer people who have not been following this project for more than a couple of months, please keep the following points in mind before commenting: 

1. Ambrosus has a particular style. I like to call it the ""Work More Talk Less"" approach. What this means is that you as an investor are not a priority. Ambrosus is a project oriented towards food and medicine companies (among others): they are not advertising a speculative investment. If you don't like this, then don't invest. However, if you do invest and wish to participate in the community -- keep this in mind. 

What does ""Work More Talk Less"" Include? No unnecessary announcements, No drive to pump the price, No desire to announce irrelevant partnerships. 

2. This is a project that does not need to justify its legitimacy. If you have followed ANY of their events or conference events you know this: Collaborating with Two Universities. Partnership with the UN. Top PhD's on all sides of the project. Recent CMO hire from Versace. Working with multiple Governments. 

Why does this matter? The reason why partnerships are important in the crypto-space, is to demonstrate legitimacy and project potential. If you have done ANY research at all on Ambrosus, you will know they have no need to demonstrate legitimacy. 

Result: Do not question, doubt, or cry if another supply chain project announces a partnership and Ambrosus doesn't. It is a categorical mistake. 

3. Ambrosus is focused on long-term, sustainable growth. It is also absolutely one of a kind in the supply-chain space. 

What does this mean? If you read their road-map you will know that they are thinking on the level of months and years. This means that they are in no rush. They do not care about the short term price movement. They do not care how long a partnership will take to sign, or solidify. To ask why there hasn't been an NDA announcement is again, a categorical mistake. Don't make those mistakes. 

Finally, Ambrosus is absolutely unique. Yes -- more so than any other supply chain project that I know of. Why you ask? Because -- and I really don't think many people understand this -- Ambrosus is custom-designing their own 'quality focused' sensors. So any other supply chain company can trace, track, combine, monitor, plenty of things in the supply chain space with a blockchain. But only Ambrosus will be able to custom-make a specific device for a companies' specific needs pertaining to food and pharmacy. In the future they will do this with 3D Printing. 

This is on a whole other level -- Do your homework on this, to really understand it: https://blog.ambrosus.com/ambrosus-3d-printed-mobile-sensor-hub-and-seals-innovation-lab-update-4163386f8fbe

https://ambrosus.com/assets/4-2_Food_Sensors_and_TracersNEW.pdf

My hope from this is that instead of bringing the normal crypto mentality to the Ambrosus Community, you stop and listen, so that you can start thinking through the Ambrosus lens.

It was great to hear Dr. Versetti talk and elucidate many of the finer technical aspects of the Ambrosus Blockchain Project.

There was a lot of interest at the event and the Q&amp;A session was great as it allows for a direct channel with AMB senior management. The crowd felt very engaged and ""part of something"". It was a good feeling. 

I was wondering if there are any other Reddit users present in this forum who live in the States? Are there any other large Ambrosus support communities in any other major North American cities? I'd like to use this thread as a type of brain storming session for how we can basically crowd source innovation and develop a network of vested individuals ranging from Supply chain companies themselves to crypto enthusiasts.

We know that Atlas Masternodes are incentivized by Challenge Fee awards.

&gt; Storage Fee — $10 USD per Bundle per 365 days

&gt; Storage Fee Split - 50% is used to start five Ownership Challenges on the data

So, for every bundle created there is a storage fee of $10 USD. Of that $10, half of it is used to initiate challenges, which means that for every bundle created, $5 will be going to Atlas Masternodes: Omega (75k AMB), Sigma (30k AMB), and Zeta (10k AMB). 

Predicting the number of bundles created is purely speculative at this point, but in the AMA Angel said that, ""Assuming the successful roll-out and adoption of AMB-NET, we would be talking about millions of bundles produced daily"".

I will calculate speculative earnings for operators of the Atlas Zeta Masternode given two scenarios of daily bundles produced within AMB-NET: 100,000 bundles and 1,000,000 bundles.

Total Daily AMB Storage Fees = Storage Fee * Bundles per day = $10 * 100,000 = $1,000,000

Daily Earnings for all Atlas Masternodes = $1,000,000 * 50% = $500,000

To calculate the percentage of the total Atlas Masternodes fee earnings that will be earned by Zeta, I divide Zeta's 10K AMB requirement by the total Atlas AMB requirements for the three different tiers.

10 / (75+30+10) = 10 / 115 = .087

Daily Earnings for all Zeta Masternodes = $500,000 * .087 = $43,500

To find the daily earnings for each Zeta Masternode, I divide $43,500 by the number of operating Zeta nodes, or wallets holding 10K-30K AMB, which I found to currently be 589. 

Daily Earning for a Zeta Masternode at 100,000 bundles per day = $43,500 / 589 = $73.85

Doing the same for a 1,000,000 bundle per day scenario:

Total Daily AMB Storage Fees = Storage Fee * Bundles per day = $10 * 1,000,000 = $10,000,000

Daily Earnings for all Atlas Masternodes = $10,000,000 * 50% = $5,000,000

Daily Earnings for all Zeta Masternodes = $5,000,000 * .087 = $435,000

Daily Earning for a Zeta Masternode at 1,000,000 bundles per day = $435,000 / 589 = $738.54


**TLDR:**

At 100,000 bundles produced daily on AMB-NET, a Zeta Masternode (10K AMB) would earn $73.85 per day, or $26,955.25 per year.

If speculating earnings on the assumption of a successful launch and industry adoption of AMB-NET, 100,000 bundles per day may be conservative, instead it may be in the millions.

At 1,000,000 bundles produced daily on AMB-NET, a Zeta Masternode would earn $738.54 per day, or $269,567.10 per year.

There are 17m tokens in nodes right now. All of the staking calculations I've seen floating around this sub are contingent upon a static number of nodes. Given the figures, the number of nodes can theoretically increase by a factor of 8. That would require the entire circulating supply to be ""locked up"", which is unrealistic, but perhaps operate as if the number of nodes stands to increase by a factor of 6-7. 

Be wary of any coin that promises unbelievably lucrative rewards. There is a reason most staking models only yield 3-6% annual revenue. These systems are self regulating. As soon as income rises above that, another variable will shift. In the case of AMB, as node reward pools increase, the number of nodes will increase as well. 

Now of course, this percentage is derived from the *current* value of a node at any moment. If you purchase your nodes early, you stand to make great returns if/when AMB appreciates. 

But for purposes of annual staking return, it is wise to assume that node income will never exceed 10-15% annually, until the maximal number of possible nodes are reached. Economic equilibrium. If there will be cap on the number of nodes, this is subject to change.

I would like to present you my dApp submission, EasySafe, which I have made a while ago and would like to get some feedback for you!

With the idea of EasySafe I suggest to (1) make the whole process of importing goods a lot more time and cost efficient, but also just easier, (2) be able to conduct the check of origin at the border within a matter of seconds and be sure that it is correct, and (3) eliminate corruption at the border by making the framework transparent. EasySafe benefits everyone: exporters, officials and consumers. The dApp is also highly customisable and can be tailored to the needs depending on the product.

I noticed that most of the cases target the relationship between producers and consumers. That is why I decided to present my idea, which is really built for the producer-officials relationship and focuses on the framework of importing products. The fact that consumer are able to use the dApp is not the main focus, but more of a great addition making it an all-in-one dApp that can be used by anyone.

My case is global (and not focused on one industry), because I really believe that it can solve a lot of problems and improve the importing process on the global scale. EasySafe can be used by every exporter all over the world and by officials of any country, which imports goods, and by any consumer, which wants to know more about the product. I also believe that it has great potential with AMB's connections in the United Nations, World Resources Forum and the EU.

Are they two separate tokens? Do members who stake get rewarded in Nectar? Below, I want to provide the best reasoning I can for what Nectar means for the new system released. 

First things first, I think that ultimately there will only be one token - Amber -- and Nectar is merely a unit of measurement. Before you start hypothesizing otherwise, hear me out: 

1. First, we read the following in the AMBERnomics model: Section 2.7 --

""AMB-NET prices AMB transactions in terms of Nectar, a specialized unit that measures the computational intensity of various actions on the network, and on a floating scale, akin to the concept of Gas in Ethereum.""

What do we get from this? That Nectar is a unit of measurement that is tied to the transactions happening on the network. I think the clearest reason for why it is likely that Nectar is not a separate token is that if it were, it could be a speculative asset: if Nectar was something sold on an exchange (akin to NEO's gas) market manipulation would dictate its price -- and thus it would lose its function as a measure of the value needed to use the Ambrosus network. 

Lets' keep reading:

""Thus, Nectar costs rise as data transactions become larger or more complex. In certain market environments, Nectar’s floating rate can also reinforce AMB-NET price stability, ensuring that Storage and Transaction Fees never become unreasonable or hinder the industrial adoption of AMB-NET.""

What this section means is that Ambrosus has a built in equilibrium model: when there are too many transactions on the Ambrosus network, the price of Nectar (i.e. the cost of using the network) will be quite high. This means that at a certain point, the network will be able to correct itself, and thereby keep transactions flowing at a relatively constant rate. Again, because Nectar is said to rise with data transactions, it seems unlikely that such a unit of measurement would be tokenized and put on an exchange to be speculated upon (i.e. no 'Nectar' token). 

To finish the section: 

""Thus, Nectar and Amber have a dynamic relationship to facilitate harmonic interaction between different stakeholders of AMB-NET.""

Ultimately, Amber is required to access the system. If nectar is what monitors the cost of transacting within the system, then the price of nectar will always be correlated with the demand for Amber. High transaction costs = lower demand. Low transaction costs = higher demand. 

One final reason why I believe that there will be no 'Nectar' token: 
 In Section 2.5 we read the following:

""AMB-NET generally delegates this capability to Hermes Nodes, which produce data, and Atlas Nodes, which resolve Challenges and store data in exchange for AMB token rewards."" 

Thus, the Atlas Nodes, for the average investor are rewarded with AMB tokens. By resolving challenges and storing data Atlas node holders will 'generate'/'recieve' AMB tokens as a reward -- note there is no mention of Nectar in any of this. 

Because Nectar is not mentioned as a unit of reward, it seems likely for one to conclude that AMB is in fact the only token that will operate in the system, and that it will function as both the payment and reward in the transaction and storage network. 

While many of you investors may be disappointed, I believe that is short sighted and misguided. By signing up to participate in the AMB network (via any type of Atlas node) you are signing up to store or challenge data on the network, and thereby receive AMB for the efforts. Effectively then, AMB rewards will be distributed in a passive manner for simply protecting certain data. 

While the rates for each node still must be released, it would be pointless to get impatient: this project has always been about production and supply chain logistics, and not about speculative profit. Therefore, I would be very surprised if ANY rates were released; rather I think we will only find out once the system is up and running -- in that way there is no speculative interest whatsoever -- it is merely an observed result of participating in the system.

Looking forward to keeping the conversation going in the comments. 

Hope it helped clear some things up.

With today's masternodes and whole token economic release, once again, you have shown a lot of proffesionalism and future thinking. A lot of people dumped their coins today. Well, they will probably regret this decission in next months. AMB has shown that they understand, like nobody else, how big companies works, and what they need. What people need to build better future with secured food and goods. 

However, Token economic and all MN needs more clarifications in the future, because it is very complex topic, not everyone will understand. Maybe some infographic? Simple one. 

I would like to thanks a lot for using some of my ideas! (from this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/ambrosus/comments/80qmc5/ambrosus_community_idea_prometheus_project/). I have been involved in community since December, and it always has been, and still will be amazing adventure. Using my ideas is the most awesome thing which would happen to me. I feel like I am building AMB with you guys. 

Unfortunately I won't be able to run even the smallest MN (but I will try to work my ass in weekend's job even harder to buy more AMB :p) since I don't have enought AMB tokens. I felt a little bit bad that I won't be allowed to participate in AMB-NET and futher development and giving my little power to run, secure and stabilize AMB network but then I red this: 

- Some AMB-NET users are required to deposit a specified amount of Amber to deter them from behaving in a way that disrupts or impairs the AMB-NET network. When this stake falls below a threshold value, the user loses the right to perform some network functions. The missing AMB needs to be replenished before the user can resume full participation on AMB-NET.

And this: 
- Hermes Masternodes upload data onto the network. They are the original producers and owners of data that determine its expiration date prior to upload. They can also pay other AMB-NET users a Storage Fee to host the data. 

So there will be some method to participate in AMB-NET even without proper token amount? 

One more thing, I know you have a lot of struggle with law in Europe (since nobody created good law for crypto in Europe.....) and talking about ROI, or even potential ROI for MasterNodes would't be allowed, but you should consider making some sort of simple calculator, like this one: https://neotogas.com/ to show potential amount of AMB you could earn by being Master Node. 

Thank you one more time, you have created amazing, well built token economic! I love how AMB rly thinks about future and real business, not just only about short term hype, and price speculation.

As a token holder and a financial economist, I appreciate the thought and effort that has clearly gone into the endeavour and I want you to know that it clearly comes across, so thank you.

Anybody who is upset or angry should go read the entire Ambernomics post. If you are still angry read it again. Don't be lazy. Why? Because the Ambrosus team have not been lazy. They could have been lazy and simply copied the Vechain model to make you all feel nice. Instead they have crafted something which I think is in fact superior; it is appropriate for the industry, clientel and businesses they are targeting.

As stated there are more details and incentivisation mechanisms to be worked out, so we don't yet have an exact figure for masternode ROI. However, here's my understanding:

We will be running Atlas nodes. When a company uploads supply chain data (via a Hermes node), they pay a fee in Ambrosus equal to $10 per bundle of data stored per year. 45% of this fee goes to Apollo nodes to process transactions. 5% are burnt. **The remaining 50% will be split into 5 challenge fees. These challenge fees are awarded to Atlas nodes. This is the economic incentive.** In return the Atlas nodes must: 1. verify that Hermes nodes hold the data they claim 2. Store that same data themselves.


More thoughts:

Anybody who thinks the price has crashed clearly has a broken mouse wheel and therefore cannot zoom out the slightest amount - we're up 17% in the last week! 

The Vechain/Vethor model is almost exactly the same as the Ether/Gas model or the Ambrosus/Nectar model, except it's maybe easier to understand. I have no idea why people are so upset they don't get Nectar. Guys it makes no difference! This decision will not make you any more or less money.

All that matters is that Ambrosus creates value for users and businesses in their ecosystem. Generating real value and utility will bring success, and with this latest release I am even more confident the team will continue to excel in their objectives.

Thank you for all you do and keep up the amazing work.

I read through Angels AMA, and was hoping for just a little more clarification about running a Zeta node. I'm not super tech savvy, so I apologize in advance for any ignorance on my part. I only have a couple questions which may or may not be answerable yet, but here goes:

1) Will it be possible to stake/run the node from a raspberry pi? I currently have a laptop that is a few years old and I'm worried about performance, or lack thereof, and being connected to the internet 24/7 for running a node.

2) As a US citizen, are there any current or foreseeable issues with the SEC and government regarding the running a node?

3) Is there going to be a cutoff for anyone looking to run a node? I'm just short of 10k, and would like to purchase the remaining AMB to reach 10k when I have the funds available. Not that purchasing more would be in vain because I cant get a node, I'm long term here, but the incentive is wonderful.

Thanks for your time.

We may not hit VeChains mcap but even if we hit 1/6th of VeChain that's $4-5 per AMB. We are currently at 1/25th-1/30th of VENs mcap. On the sidenote, with what the AMB team is doing I honestly don't see why AMB can't achieve VeChain valuations. Thats my personal opinion.

Also, I would encourage anyone who hasn't read the links in Weekly Discussion thread to do so. Articles as well as updates. Plenty of information that will make you confident that this token is a 110% HODL! 

I've staked a Sigma node because I honestly believe this is one of the most undervalued companies in CC-space when considering what sort of market-share Ambrosus is aiming to disrupt!

I am biased here as I used to work in pharma now I work for an analytical tech company, just for transparency sake. 

So I really want to know how deep into the supply chain does ambrosus plan to go? Simply tracking products is kind of a shallow utilization of this kind of technology. Is ambrosus looking at final product that has gone through formulation and packaging or will raw materials ranging from say cell media to packaging material from the vendor be tracked? This is important because I do not think many people realize how deep the supply chain runs and the number of players in the game when it comes to bringing a product to market. And I asked a similar question maybe a few weeks ago but then there is integration into the legacy systems that already exist at these companies. And from my own experience and speaking to other professionals pharma companies usually take 5-10 years from introduction of new tech to full adoption. How is that going to be tackled on a global level? Esepcially considering there exist management systems created by vendors and then companies who produce the products have their own management systems coded by them for them. And when attempting to get tech like this through companies you have to go through financial, site management, the scientists at the bench level and directors along with so many other positions I cannot begin to mention because there are so many. It can take some sites years to fully implement these products even after acquisition simply due to the training needed to run them. 

I have lots of other questions but I will stop there for now. None of this is meant to spread or start panic just genuine curiosity from a professional in the field. At the end of the day companies have a hard time implementing the current systems out there to better run their companies and create visibility. I'm just trying to see what makes this any different when it comes to mass adoption. 

Edit: and I really want this to be a discussion. I've done my research trust so let's leave those posts for another day and if you have any questions related to adoption and the sensors that I didn't talk then let's continue the discussion and add them to the comment section.

My main concern is since AMB is for the consumer, how would big pharma and the corrupt food industries benefit by using the Ambrosus network? Theoretically speaking, isn't that technically the opposite of what they want, us to know the details, ESPECIALLY as specific as AMB will supply? (AND ESPECIALLY FOR OUR FOOD AND DRUGS which seem to be some of the most corrupt industries, atleast in America.) 


To simplify; why would big pharma and food industries adopt something that benefits the consumer? Am I missing a major benefit a company gets from using AMB for their products?

Angel was very kind to allow me and my colleague to conduct a podcast interview with him last week. We are both huge fans of Ambrosus so were very excited for the opportunity to put forward questions to him from this great community.

I'm pleased to announce the podcast is now available for you to listen!

There are some juicy points there, which I think are worth being highlighted to the rest of the community. Feel free to add anything that I missed btw:

• 1 bundle = 10,000 “entries” (from sensors, certificates), for example: 1000 assets x 10 events each or 100 assets x 100 events. EDIT: As long as the calculation done reaches 10k entries, or less, the maths can't exceed that limit.

• The longer the fees generate integrity for the network = the higher the fees collected by each node, i.e. more usage on the network = the higher the returns for nodes.

• 28 months = time frame discussed so that the nodes continue increasing in collected fees over that time - this would offer more integrity regarding the security of the whole network if the nodes had an obligatory amount of time to hold them. EDIT: Also, the longer you hold the node = the higher the returns.

• When does Angel expect the amount of bundles to exceed 1 million per day? Assuming all of the current PoC companies sign up, it can easily exceed that amount within a year. Pessimistically if 20/30% signed up, the figures would still be close to that 1 million daily bundles figure. This is expected to be run on the blockchain “probably in a year from now” - according to Angel.

• Amount of each type of node: “30/40 Apollo nodes, 100/200 Hermes nodes, and a bunch of Atlas nodes”. No figure for Atlas nodes yet given.

• Don't expect any official information from Ambrosus regarding figures on how much ROI can be made for node holders, due to legal restrictions, which would constitute it as an economical vehicle for making money. So I'd imagine that a community collaboration (which we've seen a lot of already) is the best bet to provide this information, based on the information we have at hand currently.

• EDIT: Mainnet, accessible to public &amp; companies, is expected to be launched in July, as per the roadmap, the INDUSTRIAL GRADE network will be released ""towards the end of the year"".

I thought that this information was very very positive and it gives an optimistic and bullish outlook for the future of node holders.

Thanks again for the podcast OP!

There are a ton of great websites that provide a number of analytical data and info on cryptocurrencies. These are great, but it's easy to feel overwhelmed and confused while getting started in the space.

This is why my cousin and I launched [https://coin\-deck.com](https://coin-deck.com/) It's a mobile friendly, easy to navigate crypto index with a playing cards format. It focuses on discovering and tracking cryptocurrencies through the use of filters and sort options.

Currently, the websites lets you search cryptocurrencies based on market cap, price, age, industry, ratings and types. You can then filter the results through various options such as 24h gains, 24 volume or ATH traceback.

You can also add coins to your watchlist and add the ones you hold to your portfolio ""deck"" to track your earnings.

More features and filters will be added as we go along.

Well, I thought it would be worthy to share that Mr. Croncota is apparently involved in additional projects, namely 'Clairy'. Clairy was launched by a Milan-based 2015 startup called Laboratori Fabrici. Clairy has developed smart flowerpots which not only purify air but provide ""real-time pollution analysis, as well as humidity and temperature monitoring"". 

It seems as though the technological needs and developments of Ambrosus and Clairy certainly have some overlap, but one would think the marketing would be entirely different. For instance, Clairy is designed directly for consumers. Ambrosus, on the other hand, has to be marketed to more than just consumers. But I must admit that this is minor-league speculation; I have no qualifications when it comes to marketing. Thus, I will end by noting that while Mr. Croncota's official role with Clairy is merely advisory, in the video below he does imply that Clairy is the next chapter of his career. I therefore felt it necessary to share for the situational awareness of the Ambrosus community.

Edit: 'situational awareness' means I'm giving you information; I'm not telling you what to think of it.

Please, anyone who has information or links on how to watch the Dr.Versetti present live, share them... 

Also, I wanted to share my thoughts.. I consolidated heavily into AMB about 3 weeks ago... It's been a great ride... But, I have seen other coins value dump after master node announcements (Vechain, OriginTrail).. I think it comes down to a few things in my opinion:

A.**The most important, and variable fact, is the low market cap**... this coin hasn't really had time to build much value to see a major drop. If the tokenomics announcement prove this coin is comparable to VeChain (which I think it will).. then look at the massive difference in market caps
**AMBROSUS ~$100Million** **VECHAIN ~3BIllion** THATS A 30X diifference.... and in my opinion.. one more reason why AMB could go 30x in a       very short time

B. **Secondary coin generation** Nectar.... if AMB announces that just holding AMB will generate Nectar, similar to GAS/THOR, then the herds will stampede to this coin and we will moon. If no Nectar, I'd expect some stagnation with a steadier slower climb. 

C. **Tiered Master nodes**... This is also variable.. due to the low market cap... and if the tokenomics announcement is favorable.. I could see people flocking to get coins for the nodes (but maybe thats what is happening right now??) 



In conculsion, I think Ambrosus has an Ace up the sleeve with the extremely low market cap... the more I think about it... the more it seems the only place this coin can go is UP, UP and UP... I mean we could see a 3X price increase in a week (100mil to 300 mil market cap)... This is not unlikely...

This is **by no means an attempt at fud, the project fundamentals are great** and I am still invested myself but I feel like addressing a few things:



**- Please stop censoring normal discussion on this subreddit**
The amount of deleted posts on this subreddit are insane. Mention vechain? Delete. Mention specifics about an already announced partnership? Deleted. Mention any other competitor? Delete.


To cite a comment of a user here (I do not agree with everything he says) -
https://www.reddit.com/r/ambrosus/comments/8j4jfy/why_i_am_certain_ambrosus_will_succeed/dyx0c3r/?context=0



I do not agree with the comment about the lack of volume, that simply does not say anything about the project. I do not agree with his definition of a dump, AMB recovered fine so far and was one of the best gainers. I do not agree with the biz shill argument; that is not within the power of the team. 



I do agree with the partnership comment, **but** I can understand why it would not be a good thing to make everything public and cause a massive amount of hype, only to end up with nothing. (Like competitors are doing, lol). Therefore the argument is invalid. If the tech itself is there and easy to adopt the businesses using it will follow by nature and the network will gather value from this adoption. Think about the long run like Angel is doing and not a shortterm pump and dump, please. Furthermore, if you have remarks to make about ""biz red flags"" shout them loud or just shut up in general, because **that** is fud.



**I do however agree** with his comment about posts being deleted and so on, censoring does not align with the crypto ideology and its open-source nature, therefore this is something that should be refrained from. Yes, of course, you delete posts which spread inaccurate information or plain false information, but deleting a normal discussion thread is a step too far. A simple comment with the facts laid out (in a normal way) would be a better action to take than to just censor the post and move on.



**I noticed** I am not the only one thinking this way, a subreddit was created by the name xxx (removed upon request) with the only information given: “An uncensored subreddit for the Amber token” which leads me to believe that this person’s post were censored before and he had no means of reaching out to the community anymore. **It’s possible he was censored rightfully** and I don’t know what happened because his account pretty much went silent but the fact that he created this subreddit is a cause for concern on this matter.



Please allow normal discussions here and stop censoring.

I can think of all the times patients have said, the pharmacy switched my medication and it's not the same. Even though the medication is technically the same, the generics don't always function the same. No where is this more evident than in contraceptive pills. Many patients who've been stable for years upon having their medications switched to generics then have their entire cycles thrown out of balance and spend months trying to re\-regulate and find a working formula.  

Think what transparency could do for this market.  Have they found a new supplier for the generics? Are the quality control measures the same? Have they been warehoused somewhere waiting for a contract to be signed before coming to market? Did 1 in 10 get altered en route like wine can at times? What's the true life cycle behind what you're actually putting in your body? Does it really matter when you're talking antihypertensives, antiarrythmics, anticoagulants? How about antipsychotics? Just ponder that for a bit.  

The rapid increases in food allergies. 

What if we find that there's a concentration of patients with ""gluten sensitivity"" whose product tracks back to a particular genetically modified strain of wheat that is mass produced d/t it's drought tolerance? I realize this is much more far fetched than the medication examples above, but just ponder it for a bit when thinking about large conglomerates producing certain products. 

I'm incredibly optimistic long term on Ambrosus and the future for tracking food as well as medication.  Will all that be public? Probably not as child chains come on board but the transparency will be improved and that could be a tremendous win for the public.

For example, we know they're testing things out with Migros, and hopefully they will become a confirmed partner in the near future. However if you check Migros' 2016 company report, it states that, in total, they delivered 4 Billion products during that year. This sounds like a lot, but put against the metrics of 1 million bundles a day, it isn't so impressive.


(1 million bundles a day) x (10,000 events, max number per bundle) = 10 Billion events Ambrosus has to be logging a day. This is the worst case scenario because it assumes each item only has one corresponding event.

However, if each item has a more realistic 10 events associated with them then Ambrosus needs to be tracking **1 Billion** items per day. That is quite the amount considering Migros only ships 4 billion items during an entire year. Therefore, if Migros FULLY adopted Ambrosus into its supply chain, with 10 events per item, that would only get us 1.09% of the way there to 1 million bundles a day. Considering Migros is probably one of the larger companies Ambrosus has got going for them, it's quite hard to imagine where they are going to find the remaining 98.91% in a years time.

By next year, I think 50k would be a great and tad more realistic starting point. If they can achieve anything more than this I will consider it a truly impressive achievement. Thoughts?

Many people, including myself, are eager to set up their Atlas Masternode as soon as possible. In the recent Q&amp;A Vlad mentioned that there would initially be a limited number of slots for these masternodes and more slots would open up over time (in the future there probably won't be a limit). The first slots will be made available to long term holders of AMB.

My question is how do I ensure that I am ""in line"" to claim my slot for a masternode? Do I simply need to hold AMB in a non-exchange wallet? I know KYC isn't happening yet but is there any other sort of registration to perform?

I do have a concern with how I have been storing my AMB tokens. I have been trading AMB for about 2 months now and my balance has bounced back and forth between my Binance account to my Exodus wallet, back to my Binance account, then to MyEthereumWallet, back to Binance and then back to MEW.

Sorry if I'm the last guy to realize this, but I haven't really seen this point debated... anywhere. So you know how we all can't believe the masternode return numbers? How they're too good to be true? Well, I possibly just found out it is too good to be true. I was watching [this video (timestamped)] (https://youtu.be/38dZxXn3zAw?t=1089) which was recently posted to the subreddit of an ambrosus presentation and heard an interesting point come up when Vlad was explaining in detail how the data storage part of the system would work. 

Turns out that companies, using their Hermes node or whatever, can just store bundles privately and internally, without the need of Atlas nodes. So this kind of freaked me out and I went back and re-read their 'tokenomics' medium post and guess what?  

&gt;**2.1 AMB-NET Data Overview**

&gt;By default, all data created on or uploaded to AMB-NET is private, as most enterprise data needs to be concealed, due to regulations, contractual agreements and trade-secret protection. All AMB-NET data is stored off-chain and covered only by a guarantee limited to tamper-proofing. The sole Owner of private data is responsible for preventing its loss and/or contamination.

""as most enterprise data needs to be concealed"". Well fuck.

So in other words, even if, by some miracle, they achieve 1 million bundles in a years time, all bundles by default will not be interacting with PUBLIC Atlas nodes. This raises question like; are companies still paying $10 per bundle when they are just storing data privately and if so, do they basically get that $10 back through their Hermes node etc? Or is that fee only applicable when they also want to push data to the public via Atlas nodes. If its cheaper to store privately, why wouldn't everyone just do that? What percentage of bundles would be given to Atlas nodes vs just in private company silos? 

Felt fine during this crash since I was feeling pretty good with a Sigma node. Not so sure anymore... Feedback?

**EDIT: Vlad Trifa Response:**

Private and semi-private data is exclusively stored within hermes nodes, yes, but their hashes and metadata are ALWAYS automatically combined in bundles. Without exception, ALL bundles are stored on Atlas nodes (remember that bundles are NOT the data itself - only metadata &amp; hashes of hashes of the data). Hashes of the bundles only are then written on the blockchain. Only public data is stored on Atlas nodes (we do not plan at the moment to store any non-public data on Atlas nodes, not even encrypted data, to guarantee maximal gdpr and data privacy compliance and reduce risk of any sensitive data to get hacked). Technically, hermes nodes can also store data ‘privately’ locally (not in a bundle) for free as the reddit post feared (e.g. which makes sense for archiving a lot of raw sensor data), but then there will be no proof/trust at all for that data (essentially this data might as well in any other traditional db, so companies will likely not want/need to use Ambrosus for that anyway, therefore not affecting at all our system’s crypto economy and amb-net usage, hence the issue pointed doesn’t exist). it’s just a side feature of hermes nodes not related to amb-net. In short, any company who wants to store trusted data, it will have to put it in bundles, and those bundles will be stored on apollo nodes, and therefore nodes storing those bundles will be rewarded as per our model.

Companies wanting to store private data without trust will continue to do so in their private systems like they’ve been doing for ages (and until they will want to make their data trusted, they will not use amb-net anyway, but rather their existing internal solutions). Amb-nets purpose is to allow them to store trusted data (both private and public data), and the only way they can do that is to store them inside bundles that will be stored on Atlas nodes, and technically hermes nodes as well)

I just played around with this calculator: [http://ambrosus.yannlevy.eu/](http://ambrosus.yannlevy.eu/)

... and had a look at the numbers provided in this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ambrosus/comments/8nuj24/ambrosus\_masternode\_math\_updated/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ambrosus/comments/8nuj24/ambrosus_masternode_math_updated/)

So let's assume the following: There are 250,000 bundles a day (= 25,000,000 USD, 50&amp;#37; of this goes to the Omage, Sigma and Zeta nodes) and 1 AMB costs 1 USD

I read somewhere that the payouts of the masternodes are delivered in AMB \- so basically 12,500,000 USD in AMB. With AMB at 1 USD this would mean that every day 12,500,000 AMB would be paid to the masternode holders.

Question 1: Let's imagine most of the masternode holders won't sell their AMB provided through a masternode in the first 30\-40 days \- the amount of AMB collected by masternode holders would be bigger than the total supply of the coin.

Question 2: Wouldn't the generation of these huge amounts of AMB end up to a big dump of the coin on a daily basis? Who would buy those coins?

I would also like to thank Stephen Croncota for showing me how humble and genuine, a stellar marketing personality can be. 

Lastly I want to thank our lovely community and every community member I have interacted with over the last six months, and every FUDD and FOMO cycle we have been through together. Thank you for the beautiful memes, please leave them on as a souvenir for me. Also as a souvenir, I still keep the rice bag I was smuggled in, ready so that I can stick the Ambrosus Sensor on it once it can be purchased in the market.

Today as I leave I take back a little of Ambrosus with me, and cherish these experiences I had. 

Wish the project a grand success!

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/14nwMtv0rc0GUNuD6K\_hS6nVVrFyM\_h2G/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14nwMtv0rc0GUNuD6K_hS6nVVrFyM_h2G/view)

And:

Assumptions - [https://imgur.com/eyTzcK7](https://imgur.com/eyTzcK7)

Calc - [https://imgur.com/5qvLi2X](https://imgur.com/5qvLi2X)

\---------

For months people have been saying that the masternode payout picture looks too good to be true and I think that is accurate - with 'conservative' estimates providing returns of 800% per annum etc.

I think the total number of masternodes is about correct, using up 50% of the total circulating supply which is in line with other projects. Numbers estimated in June were: 234 Omega nodes (3x current amount), 816 Sigma nodes (4x current amount) and 2,915 Zeta nodes (5x current amount).

However I think the bundle numbers are simply far too high. Angel previously said that adoption will bring with it 1,000,000 bundles a day - I think this is a very long term view.

He recently said in the AMA that we should have 1k bundles from launch. I know the question was phrased more in line with - when will we see 1k bundles go through the platform, rather than how many will there be at launch - but still. This equates to up to 1m transactions a day (up to 1k transactions per bundle). To use a comparison, TE-Food who have been in operation since 2016 supposedly serves more than 6,000 business customers, and handles 400,000 transactions each day. This would equate to only 400 bundles (minimum - could be more) in Ambrosus' model - and they apparantly  trace 12,000+ pigs, 200,000+ chickens, and 2.5 million eggs per day (THIS IS NOT A SHILL OF TE-FOOD - JUST A USEFUL COMPARISON).

\----------

So I think 1k bundles to start with is probably reasonable - though even this could be optimistic. Under the latest assumptions noted above, this would provide  an annual pay out for 3,000 Apollo zeta nodes of $54-188, so average of $121. Recent prices of masternodes went down to $2.5k at their lowest, giving an initial ROI of 5%. This seems reasonable to me.

It therefore means that if we get up to 5k bundles/day then we will see an ROI of 25%. 10k = 50% etc.

I think these are the numbers we should be thinking about and focusing on. Will 1m bundles happen? Probably not any time soon - these would equate to up to 1 billion transactions. Not impossible - but its not what we should be thinking about for the next few years minimum.

Hope that's cleared things up a little.

(For disclosure I own some Ambrosus. I don't own any TE-Food).

As it was very long, I found it quite tedious to have to dig through to find information. Therefore as a general reference, below I have gone over the four main areas that I think are most important to keep in mind, based on what Angel said. 

Also, as a disclaimer, I did not create a specific section on marketing, as I think everyone knows that Angel has said that is a priority going forward. If you would like to add that in, however, feel free to do so in the comments below. 

Finally, a general summary is at the bottom, so if you don’t have time, you can always skip down there for the most important points. 
Best – Mike Lee00. 

**Section 1: Hardware and Sensors**

**Hardware and Software Solutions:** First, in response to “OneDrip” Angel clarified the fact that Ambrosus focuses both on Hardware and Software solutions: What this means is that beyond providing the Software (AMB-NET 1.0), Ambrosus is also custom designing “a catalogue of hardware products/solutions” that “has an exclusive usage of AMB-NET attached to them.” Consider this a key differentiator about Ambrosus: not only do they provide their own Network, but they also custom designed hardware sensors to interact with their network exclusively. 

**Tamper-Proof Sensors:** Second, Angel clarified in response to “Johnmwager” the importance of Ambrosus’ homemade ‘tamper-proof sensors’. The basic idea is that existing sensors (i.e. the kind that can be bought ‘off-the-shelf’) are more vulnerable for data corruption, interference, and hacking. With Ambrosus’ special tamper-proof sensors, companies have the opportunity to increase the security of their data-collection. Nevertheless, companies will still be able to use their own sensors to connect to AMB-NET, however they may not be as secure, as Ambrosus’ homegrown solution. 

**Sensor Cost:** Third, in response to “Instinctlol” Angel referred to Dr. Stefan Meyer’s Team, with regard to sensor cost. While there may be an update coming in the following weeks, Angel’s initial comments indicated that the cost of sensors depends on their complexity, and the amount that are going to be produced (i.e. a certain sensor could range between $4 and $20 dollars). The timeframe he indicated was that within 6 months, certain sensors could be produced for use by a company, if they had the need for them. 

**The Unique Blockchain – IoT Platform:** Fourth and finally, in response to “Stevek216” Angel revealed the future vision of Ambrosus’ hardware and software solutions: “Our bigger Research and Development ambition for the next 2-3 years is to design and develop a more advanced architecture for a platform that would allow massively scalable device to device communication in a decentralized environment.” 

In more simple language: Ambrosus strives to become the platform that can allow for massive sensor integration, in an open-source environment. This ultimately would allow for anyone to track whatever they desired in a cost-effective, secure, and decentralized way. Importantly, Angel keenly pointed out that no other Crypto project has this working today. 

**Section 2: Onboarding Masternodes**

**Cold Storage:** The first point that many hoped to have clarified by Angel was answered in response to “alexnegrete”: Angel clarified that cold storage will definitely be the means of verifying how long Node holders have had their coins for. Doing this from an exchange is not possible. Importantly, the goal of the cold storage measure and other measures related to onboarding masternodes is that Ambrosus is pursuing a ‘no-nonsense’ approach that will try to make the onboarding process as quick and smooth as possible.
 
**KYC Screenings:** Second, while it was originally thought that a KYC screening is a necessary precondition for running a node, in response to “Xiagan”, Angel has indicated a different approach: “Chances are we can devise a framework with launching AMB-NET out of a jurisdiction where there are no stringent requirements like in most of Europe on KYC for nodes.” This however, will only pertain to Atlas nodes, as Apollo and Hermes nodes will most likely also require KYC to avoid “network hijacking”. Clearly however, this is one area that is still under development. 

**Seamless Processing:** Third, in order to make the node hosting process as smooth as possible, Ambrosus is working with certain partners for additional network infrastructure. What this means, is that companies like “Microsoft” have offered to host the Ambrosus Masternodes and also possibly provide certain customer services. In this sense, it appears that through such a partnership Ambrosus will save time and gain a smooth method of running nodes on their network. 

**Team of Cryptoeconomic Researchers:** Fourth, and most important for the community to keep in mind, Angel has discussed payouts of masternodes, and other technicalities in response to “B5SF”, “Username_not_Relevant” and “GS43”. Specifically, Angel has indicated that Ambrosus has hired a team of experienced cryptoeconomists, who are currently in the process of figuring out a) how often masternode rewards can be withdrawn, b) the relationship between companies adopting Ambrosus and the number of bundles increasing on the network (i.e. how many companies will get AMB-NET to 1 million bundles per day?), and c) how exactly to incentivize long term participation with Ambrosus nodes (i.e. through raising network transaction fee’s allocated to more loyal nodes over time). 
Importantly, Angel has indicated that there will be an update at some point in July concerning these major developments of AMBERnomics. According to Angel’s response to “methpd” a more advanced cryptoeconomic paper will be provided which will go “fill the gaps on all unanswered questions…and will also go deeper into the rewards for different masternodes and onboarding policy.” 

**The Underlying Implication:** Taken altogether, a very important point should become clear to the Ambrosus community: the current developments in cryptoeconomics are being done with a mind towards regulation, customer experience, and the long-term efficiency of the network. While an update has been promised for July, it is important to also keep in mind that because their priorities are on doing the AMBERnomics process correctly, this may take priority over releasing everything on time. Merely keep this in the back of your mind, so that if there is some unforeseen delay, you do not feel betrayed or as if the team has failed on their end.

**Section 3: Corporate Partnerships**

**NDA vs. PoC:** First, in response to “D-Lux” and “Onedrip” Angel broke down some very important information about how Ambrosus operates with corporate clients. While a more in depth article may be called for, the basic idea is this: an NDA is merely a confidentiality document – in this sense, how many NDA’s that have been signed, are more or less irrelevant. Why? Because NDA’s are typically signed in Stage 1 of the process: for starting discussions. So far, Ambrosus has signed more or less 200 – 300 NDA’s. Nevertheless, more importantly is what comes next: Proof of Concepts (PoC’s). These, according to Angel, are much more important because a Proof of Concept is ultimately the stage in which a company imagines how the Ambrosus eco-system could provide a solution to one of their problems. This is where one is able to see if Ambrosus can help a food or pharmacy company somewhere in their supply chain by running a pilot project. According to Angel, Ambrosus currently is running around 30 different PoCs. Finally, after running a pilot project, whereby the value of Ambrosus has been demonstrated, Ambrosus then enters into further negotiations with companies for larger adoption of AMB-NET, and more long-term focused partnerships. 

**The Mini-Documentary:** Second, in response to “Rainsong94” Angel clarified that accompanying a particular pilot project, will be a mini-documentary. According to Angel, this pilot project shows the successful integration of “one of the most valuable agricultural commodities in the world” to AMB-NET. Importantly, this integration has been into a “proper large-scale supply chain.” 

**The Number of Client Companies:** Third, in response to “Username_not_Relevant” Angel has clarified that Ambrosus currently has over 100 companies “in the pipeline”. More specifically, 1/3 of such companies are large enterprises, while the remaining 2/3 are medium enterprises. Such a figure should give a good indication about usage of the AMB-NET and where Angel discussed elsewhere, the idea of a network running up to 1 million bundles a day within 1 – 2 years after AMB-NET launch. 

**Quality First:** Fourth, and finally, hidden in many of Angel’s responses are pieces of information that give a good indication about the internal ethos that Ambrosus adopts when working with corporate clients: A) Ambrosus is currently “focused on getting people onboard who will help upgrade and expand existing relationships”. This is clearly visible through the recent hire of Philippe Bellintani. Importantly, this is being done, “instead of focusing too much on getting new partners”. B) According to Angel, the cornerstone of corporate relationships with Ambrosus is that the Ambrosus team “delivers and builds things that make sense.” In context, one of the largest companies in the world recently commended the Ambrosus team for their ability to provide a valuable solution, in a smooth and efficient manner. C) According to Angel’s response to “YashiLou” Ambrosus has made huge progress in terms of the corporate engagement, PoC and Use Cases, as well as technology and development. 

All three of these points indicate that Ambrosus is building a “quality first” eco-system for supply chains, where the groundwork for onboarding more companies is currently being laid. 

**Section 4: The Big Picture**

**The Year of Corporate Tinkering (2017) and the Year of Awakening (2018):** First, in terms of the growth timeline of Ambrosus, Angel has referred to the current stage of blockchain development in the supply chain as the “Year of Awakening”. In his own words in response to “YashiLou”: “Right now the benefits of the blockchain in general terms are widely understood by the tech departments of all leading companies worldwide and now they try to see how blockchain could be more than just a gimmick.” This is in contrast to how last year was considered “the year of corporate tinkering”. The larger point here is that Ambrosus is positioned exceptionally well to fit the needs of the corporates that are ‘waking up’ to the blockchain’s potential. 

**AMB-NET 1.0 vs. AMB-NET Industrial Launch 2.0:** Second, while AMB-NET is set to launch in the coming month or so, the AMB-NET Industrial Launch towards the end of the year is also something to keep in mind. According to Angel’s response to “christogil” the main difference between the two platforms is the following: while AMB-NET 1.0 is a fully functioning distributed network (i.e. it can trace supply chain quality on a blockchain in a clear manner), AMB-NET 2.0 will be equipped with “legally guaranteed uptime” as well as “Service level agreements.” What this ultimately means is that AMB-NET 2.0 will be the Ambrosus blockchain/eco-system offered as a service, and maybe even as a part of Microsoft Azure’s Enterprise Solutions. Put simply: the difference is a matter of efficiency and dependability. AMB-NET 1.0 will be able to function properly, and do what it was made to do. However AMB-NET 2.0 will be able to do what it was made to do, in an efficient, and accessible manner that will make it easier for Corporates to connect AMB-NET 2.0 to their supply chains. 

**General Summary:** If you don’t have the time to read through the entire AMA, or you want to keep just a couple of points in mind from what is going on at Ambrosus, consider the following:

1. The Ambrosus eco-system is developing exceptionally well, alongside quality engagement with corporate clients. Importantly, what makes this engagement so quality, is that Ambrosus is able to demonstrate the value that their solution can bring to an industrial supply chain. 

2. Currently, a more advanced crypto-economic model is being developed that will discuss rates, rewards, payout withdrawals, and KYC requirements. To do this, Angel has hired a team of Cryptoeconomists and business analysts to fully flesh out any unanswered questions about AMBERnomics. 

3. Ambrosus is working with over 100 companies, operating 30 pilots/Proof of Concepts, and also making a mini-documentary about “one of the most valuable agricultural commodities in the world”. 

4. This year is the year of corporate awakening. AMB NET 1.0 will be launching in the coming month or so, while AMB-NET 2.0 (Industrial Grade) will be a fine-tuned, accessible and dependable blockchain for industrial supply chains.

First of all, today I finally have enough AMB for a nice node :) . Gotta move these to MEW and wait ;)

No one has been able to give a reasonable answer to the following:
Ambrosus team tokens are locked till October 2018. What guarantees that the team won't dump their tokens in that month?

Most projects (and start-ups), allow gradual unlock of equity or tokens in order to keep all team members engaged for the next few years.
With crypto, investors have an additional need that to protect against sudden massive drop in token price.

I've asked this question before and got this answer from a community member: Angel doesn't like it when ppl sell tokens; they won't sell.
I'm sorry guys but we need a better answer, preferably from the project team (Angel?)

Let me be transparent, I love the project and I'm very excited about it; I'm looking for a convincing answer as part of my due diligence.

A tiny marketcap with a impressive team and 100+ companies in the pipline.  Yes the marketing has been poor, but that's great for those of us that are here as it makes AMB a dark horse whose token value isn't proportional to it's technology and partnerships.

However, I've been thinking some more on Ambrosus and actually have several other concerns that are related to Ambrosus' cryptoeconomic model ([link](https://blog.ambrosus.com/ambernomics-a-cryptoeconomy-for-supply-chains-db6ee2467741)). Like stated in my other thread, my post may sound FUD-dish but I'm actually a supporter of Ambrosus' aims and am just playing the devil's advocate by being critical in order to determine the chance that the project will indeed succeed. I fully hope I'm wrong on the following concerns, therefore feel free to correct me when I'm wrong, I'd love to learn from your responses.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. **Does AMB-NET even need a blockchain, or can a centralized and regulated database be more efficient?**

My rationale for this is based on [this scientific article](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/375.pdf) titled 'Do you need a blockchain?'. The general thesis of the article can to an extent be simplified to the following figure (click on the link in the subscript if the figure itself doesn’t appear here in your browser):

[Original subscript from the article: \\""Fig. 1: A flow chart to determine whether a blockchain is the appropriate technical solution to solve a problem \(Table 1 should be considered  in  the  decision  making  process  as  well\).  Writers  refer  to  entities  with  write  access  to  the  database\/blockchain,  i.e.  in  a blockchain setting, a writer corresponds to a consensus participant. If a trusted third party \(TTP\) is available that is not always online, this can be used to establish a known group of writers, i.e. the TTP can function as a certificate authority in such a setting. Public and private permissioned blockchains differ in that a public blockchain allows anyone to read the contents of the chain and thus verify the validity of the stored data, while a private blockchain only allows a limited number of participants to read the chain. Note that for any blockchain based solution it is possible to make use of cryptographic primitives in order to hide privacy-relevant content.](https://i.redd.it/m1p9caox0qc11.png)

The flowchart is pretty self-explanatory. My question is related to the middle cube in the flowchart, that reads ""Can you use an always online TTP?""; I wonder if a blockchain is actually necessary and a centralized database that is regulated by authorities can not do the trick as well, but more efficiently (faster etc.).

If your answer to the above question is actually 'no, a TTP cannot be used', I feel there's another one that might apply here. I'm assuming that all writers are known, since KYC is applied for masternodes. The question 'Are all writers trusted?' could therefore actually be answered with 'yes', which would lead to 'Don't use blockchain'. If the writers for the AMB-NET blockchain aren't trusted, I think that means Ambrosus' cryptoeconomic model has failed, since apparently the penalty for malicious node behavior ([link](https://blog.ambrosus.com/ambernomics-a-cryptoeconomy-for-supply-chains-db6ee2467741)) then apparently isn't enough to trust the nodes that write on the blockchain.

My rationale above is done under the assumption that the flowchart above is 100% valid, which can obviously be debated. Nonetheless, I wonder if the data storage and bookkeeping process can't be done using a central, regulated database instead of the permissioned blockchain that is currently used. I'm really curious how other community members see this.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**2. Why does Ambrosus need it's own blockchain and can't it use another blockchain as a base-layer?**

Since AMB has a fixed supply that will only decrease due to coinburn, in my opinion the AMB token will primarily be a Medium of Exchange (MoE) between those those that create the network (nodes) and those that want to use it (companies). In that case, I feel the exchange of AMB-tokens between those parties should be a relatively simple bookkeeping-process that could also be performed by a smart contract on Ethereum, NEO, EOS or whatever other blockchain that could be used as a base-layer. Origin Trail is an example of a project that chose to go this route; it has it's own 'Origin Trail Data Network (ODN)' and it's own ERC20 token TRAC that is used as a MoE in its incentive model, but can use any other blockchain, making it flexible to switch to another blockchain at any time if faster or cheaper options become available in time. The only reason I can think of that Ambrosus would need it's own blockchain is that it has characteristics that the other blockchain's don't offer, but I can't find any justification for or discussion on this so far. Does anyone have any sources on this, and what are your opinions?

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**3. If question 2 is answered negatively; why does Ambrosus need it's own coin/token?**

When question 2 is answered in a way that Ambrosus wouldn't necessarily need it's own blockchain, you could even argue it wouldn't need it's own token to act as the MoE it needs in it's incentive scheme.

Ambrosus clearly needs a network of nodes that provide (1) data storage and (2) computing power, as the sensor-data needs to be stored off-chain (in a database) since it would otherwise clutter the actual blockchain in no-time and thus fail. Having a crypto-economic model based on game theory to incentivize the nodes to invest resources like hardware and energy consumption is therefore warranted. But why wouldn't it be able to use ETH, BTC or any other coin/token as a MoE to pay for bundle storage and node incentives?

(Which would actually be a question that could be asked for about 95+% of the current crypto tokens that ICO'd last year.)

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**4. Will AMB tokens be sold over the counter (OTC) in the future?**

Let's assume Ambrosus does indeed need it's own blockchain and token and the current setup is fully justifiable. To my knowledge, the only two types of parties that will actually be looking to *utilize* AMB tokens are (1) companies looking to use the network for bundle storage and (2) nodes looking to earn income by securing the network by investing resources like hardware and energy consumption.

The expected value flow is therefore actually quite simple; companies buy AMB to pay the fees for using the network, which go to the nodes that secure the network. The nodes will eventually sell their earned AMB to pay for the needed resources and to take profit, which they will thus sell back to the only other party interested in utilizing the tokens; the companies.

Currently, AMB is traded on exchanges. However, these exchanges collect fees for every trade, and people speculating on future prices will try to take their piece of the pie as well. IMO, this creates a clear incentive for both parties looking to utilize AMB tokens to just trade their tokens OTC in the future. Why wouldn't they?

Assuming they will primarily use OTC to trade their tokens, I would hypothesize that future AMB prices will therefore potentially be stable and somewhat related to the dollar, since cost-prices for fees are also pegged to the dollar ([link](https://blog.ambrosus.com/ambernomics-a-cryptoeconomy-for-supply-chains-db6ee2467741)). Which IMO would bring up the discussion raised in question 3 again.

Update Jul 31st: In a recent AMA with Origin Trail, their owners actually were asked a similar question whether tokens will be traded OTC. [Click here to see the video](https://youtu.be/xpovhh33gXU?t=38m20s) (respective question asked at 38:20 min). In short, they suggested the companies themselves likely won't buy the tokens on exchanges themselves as it is too technical for them, but they might use some service that does it for them. 

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Again, I'm a fan of what Ambrosus is trying to achieve and hope it succeeds as I feel it can definitely improve our lives. I'm also still trying to learn about blockchain, cryptoeconomics and would therefore love to be wrong and learn from your responses.

I do find Ambrosus' cryptoeconomic model complex, and am just being critical to find out if it will indeed succeed in the future. Feel free to correct me where I'm wrong; I'm just trying to learn myself, otherwise I wouldn't be posting this. Here's my rationale:

1. The costs of using AMB-NET (storage fees etc) are pegged to the $ (https://blog.ambrosus.com/ambernomics-a-cryptoeconomy-for-supply-chains-db6ee2467741), which means they will be relatively stable over time - they just need more or less AMB to pay for the fee. Companies looking to utilize the AMB tokens for this purpose in the future can either choose to HODL a bunch of AMB if they think the price will increase over time or just buy AMB when they need it and spend it right away. Quite convenient from a company-perspective in my opinion. 

2. However, the costs of setting up a node are pegged to the AMB token (https://blog.ambrosus.com/ambernomics-a-cryptoeconomy-for-supply-chains-db6ee2467741), which means the dollar costs will fluctuate with AMB/USD rates. Assuming AMB-NET will be a success, the total AMB supply will decrease due to coin burn, and AMB/USD rates will increase as token demand increases due to adoption. This means the dollar costs for nodes will increase over time, increasing the threshold to add new nodes to the network (only richer parties would be able to afford it). Also, the incentives for current node holders to sell their node are increased if they would-be want to opt for short-term gains instead of long-term gains for whatever reason.

I would therefore assume that it is possible (or even likely?) that the total number of AMB-NET nodes will decrease as adoption progresses, which would make the network less decentralized and thus less secure. 

What are your thoughts on this? ",NA,"92d1m5",NA,0,NA,"false",1536670547,"false","self","t5_3mh72","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/ambrosus/comments/92d1m5/will_ambnet_become_more_centralized_and_less/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

How can I increase my chances of getting a masternode quickly?**

A: At the initial stages, to get a masternode seat, you MUST fill in an online application form — there will be no exceptions! Details about this form will be sent first to all our newsletter subscribers (so make sure you’ve subscribed), and 24h later via all our other channels.

In this form, you will be able to choose an Apollo or an Atlas (the form for both nodes is different, so if you want to run both nodes, you’ll need to apply twice — once for each type of node separately). During the soft launch of mainnet (until October 2018), only a handful of nodes will be accepted to run a mainnet node, and the selection criteria will combine: “AMB holder duration” (long-term supporters since TGE will have priority), technical expertise, details provided in the application form (don’t prepare us a poem, but please explain why you should get a node before anyone else — although in a poem would be pretty cool). As many applicants will not get a mainnet right away, it’s very likely that you’ll first receive an invitation to run a test-net node (i.e. you won’t earn AMB) — so you should jump on this chance because it not only give you a chance to play around with our tech &amp; tools without any risk, but especially because test-net node operators will automatically have a preferred spot on the waiting list (i.e. running smoothly a test-net node will significantly increase your chance to earn your spot on main-net more quickly).

Before the launch of the mainnet, an auction (how many ambers they will stake) will be put in place to allow a free-market based selection process. Once a new seat opens, if you’re selected you will receive a notification and you’ll have exactly 24 hours to deposit the amount of your bid into a smart contract. If you miss the window, you’ll lose the opportunity to get the node (which will be then offered to the next highest bidder) and you’ll will have to re-enter the bidding process again (you don’t lose anything, only the opportunity to get the seat). Once the stake has been deposited, your node address will be whitelisted and you’ll now be able to host bundles or validate transactions. A lot more details on this exact process will go out in the next few weeks.

As mentioned in the post, we’ll first deploy AMB-TEST, and running a node on TEST-NET will not only give you a chance to test the setup a node with minimal risk, but also it will give you a higher priority to get a mainnet node over someone who doesn’t run a test node. Finally, sharing information with us around why you’d be the best candidate to run one of the first masternodes will go a long way to get onboarded more rapidly, as a well-thought application will stand out more than an anonymous wallet address behind a protonmail email address :)

**When will I get my rewards? And how?**

Apollo: with each block you validate you get rewards. You also receive part of the bundle transaction fees.

Atlas: periodically (you’ll get transfers every 28 days). For each bundle you store, you’ll get a proportional fraction of the reward every 4 weeks up to 65%. The last 35% will be awarded only on the last month you have to hold it (i.e. to ensure you hold your part of the bargain until the end). To get them, you simply need to call a smart contract function and (native) Amber tokens will be deposited to your (native) wallet. 

**Can I get several nodes?**

For Apollo, no — only one single node per individual /legal entity is allowed, and you’ll need to perform a thorough KYC process, along with a legal contract to guarantee minimum performance and uptime.

For Atlas, yes as many as you want, but at the initial stages you’ll need to apply for each one individually. There will be no KYC, the logic will be entirely managed by smart contracts, but you’ll need to provide an email address so we can reach you.

**Upgrade my node? Will I be able to switch from a Sigma to an Omega later on?**

Of course — we’ll provide the tooling that will make it easy for you to increase your stake and benefit instantly from a higher Bundle limit as soon as you have transferred the additional stake to the smart contract. However, upgrading from an Atlas node to an Apollo node directly will not be possible as they are very different beasts and will require you to apply for one separately.

**What is exactly a Bundle? How much data are we talking about?**

So a Bundle is a big file containing the metadata &amp; public data of (up to!) 16’384 Assets and/or Events, which Atlas nodes will need to store for at least 1 year (sometimes much more, like 5–10 years for some specific data in some industries). An Asset/Event is capped to 10 KB, so roughly speaking most Bundles would be in average 100–120 MB (up to max 164 MB). Hermes nodes are responsible to check the size of bundles and if they try to store larger bundles they may get fined. We are currently evaluating what the ideal number of bundles that can be stored by each type of node, and we’ll provide those numbers once we validate them through the large-scale testing we’ll be carrying out in the next few weeks.

**What server do I need? My raspberry Pi would do the trick, or do I need to hire 2 devops to setup an auto-scaled cluster across several data centers?**

As we require an excellent service level, we strongly recommend using a modern/reliable VPS provider such as Digital Ocean or AWS, which allows you to easily manage your node operations and leverage the SLA provided by your hosting provider. If your Apollo node disconnects, you won’t earn any reward while it’s offline, so as long as you provide the required SLA each month, no other penalty to foresee. For Atlas nodes, being down is a lot more taxing as you might lose your stake if you’re not live again within a specific period of time. Finally, note that because of the challenging process, nodes benefiting from a faster connection will get filled a lot faster than nodes with a slower connection, therefore will earn more rewards.

We are currently finalising the exact requirements for the different nodes, but all you need to know is that the potential rewards from an Atlas node will clearly outweigh the cost of the VPS.

**What about Hermes nodes? I didn’t hear much about them, are they that bad for me?**

Of course not! Hermes nodes are vital in AMB-NET as they’re in charge of creating the bundles (by storing assets &amp; events), so they’re mainly interesting for businesses and projects (they don’t get rewarded — they only spend Ambers). They are particularly relevant for developers or IT service providers who are keen to build new services and apps on top of AMB-NET and resell those. This can be very interesting for developers as they can modify Hermes nodes as they want, host and operate them, and charge as much as they want for the services they provide, which can be very interesting as the only thing they need to pay is the bundle upload costs and node hosting — no license fee and profit sharing or anything else. More on Hermes nodes very soon!

**I’m done with my running my node, can I just retire anytime? How do I get my stake back and retire it gracefully?**

Before you get your stake back, AMB-NET will need to guarantee that all the bundles you were hosting have been safely transferred to other Atlas nodes. This means of course, that you won’t be receiving any of the fees for hosting those bundles (of course that includes the hefty 35% you’ll get only in the last month), as these will go to the new hosters.

Of course, you won’t have to do anything manually as there will be an option in your application to initiate the retirement of your node. All bundles that still need to be hosted will be “given away” to others, but rest assured that there will be no shortage of Atlas node keen to pick up your bundles in minutes (as they come up with an 35% bonus attached), so this process is likely to be very short (a few minutes). Once all your bundles have been taken over, your node will be officially un-whitelisted and your stake will be returned to your wallet.",NA,"91eghn",NA,0,NA,"false",1536654297,"false","self","t5_3mh72","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/ambrosus/comments/91eghn/faq_on_masternodes_and_ambnet_launch_with_dr_vlad/",NA,"","false","","",0,1

Nevertheless, I would still highly recommend watching the talk if you have the opportunity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbeqhCQ8jLU

**Necessary Context:** Angel’s presentation was only about 30 minutes long. That means the focus of the presentation had to be general, yet still precise. In the talk Angel outlines the value proposition of Ambrosus, while also explaining in broad strokes the larger eco-system that Ambrosus is trying to create.
While the talk followed a format that was fitting for a presentation, I think the clearest and easiest way of explaining the Ambrosus eco-system is to divide the project into three main parts: 

First, 1) the problems that Ambrosus seeks to solve, as well as the main pillars that guide Ambrosus.

Second, 2) the fundamental technology that is the bedrock of Ambrosus. This concerns the sensor protocols and AMB-NET, data bundles and nodes, and the Amber token functionality. 

Third, 3) the applications of the Ambrosus eco-system, the various use-cases within the food and pharmaceutical industries, and the different industries that Ambrosus will be able to disrupt. 

Note: In the presentation, numbers 2 and 3 simply blended more often for the audience to see more practically how Ambrosus technology and hardware can be applied. 

**Section 1: Pillars and Problems**

**The Core Pillars of Ambrosus:** At the beginning of the talk, Angel discussed the core pillars that ground Ambrosus. This begins, first and foremost, 1) with the fact that Ambrosus is open source. For those more familiar with the larger cryptocurrency space, being open-source is fundamental for any degree of decentralization – it allows for collaboration and the free sharing of software code between developers for the benefit of everyone. Second, 2) Ambrosus has been built with a flexible architecture. This architecture is flexible insofar as it balances how accessible data is: on the one hand, data can be stored privately for companies, while on the other hand, other forms of data can be made publicly available and shared for everyone to see. Third, 3) Ambrosus proposes an End-to-End solution. This means that when Ambrosus approaches a supply chain problem, their solution is comprehensive (i.e. from farm to fork). Fourth, 4) Ambrosus is developer friendly. This pertains to the ability to develop applications on top of the Ambrosus blockchain. Fifth and finally 5), Ambrosus is built upon demonstrated excellence and expertise in the Internet of Things Space (IoT). What this means is that unlike simply being a data organizer, Ambrosus combines hardware sensors with their blockchain to provide a holistic solution to the problems that food and pharmacy companies face.

**Problems in the Supply Chain:** Angel outlined the three core problems (among others) that Ambrosus sets out to resolve in relation to food and pharmaceutical products: First, (1) Is the product real? Second, (2) what is the quality of the Product? This can be both for the manufacturer and the distributer (i.e. even if a manufacturer produces a quality product, the distributor may damage the product, and vis-versa). Ultimately, either end of the supply chain can malfunction, and as such companies need to know how the product quality changes over the course of its supply chain journey. Third, (3) how can data be efficiently shared? This pertains to the fact that most data in the supply chain is currently stuck in individual silos, resulting in less efficiency and maneuverability for companies. 

As we will soon see, Ambrosus takes a bottom-up approach in responding to these problems, and as such is incomparable to any other Blockchain+IoT supply chain solution currently being pioneered (more on this later). 


**Section 2: The Fundamental Technology of Ambrosus**

**High-Tech Overview:** AMB-NET is the backbone of all data storage and sensor communication. Importantly, this means that Ambrosus’ solution is twofold: 1) AMB-NET as a fully functioning blockchain. 2) Tamper-proof hardware sensors that communicate with the blockchain (through different APIs). Both used together make up the solution that Ambrosus strives to provide for companies. Additionally, with hardware sensors, the product in question can be ‘tagged’ or traced, in whatever way necessary (i.e. Ambrosus can track anything from the temperature and geographical location, to the biological makeup of a certain product). 
How the System Works: A hardware sensor is attached to a specific aspect of a product to record something about its supply chain journey. The data that the sensor records then goes to a node, where it immediately receives a cryptographic signature. Importantly, this signature verifies the data as close to the source as possible. As a result, before the data even hits the blockchain, the integrity and quality of the data can be guaranteed. Finally, all hardware sensors possess their own digital identity on the blockchain: this means that a company can see what sensor at what time, made what reading. Importantly, Angel emphasized how the system is also ‘sensor agnostic’ meaning that a company can use their own sensors as well to trace data. Altogether, the system is built to be efficient, thorough, and complete. 

**Data, Assets-Events, and Scaling:** Furthermore, a very important distinction must be made between the two fundamental types of data that the Ambrosus sensors are capable of recording. Unlike any other blockchain based supply-chain solution, Ambrosus is capable of recording **both** internal and external data of a product.  

**Internal Data** concerns ‘What is the Object’ = the chemical makeup, a structural analysis, and its real-time composition. 
**External Data** concerns ‘What is happening around the Object’ = the location, temperature, humidity, air exposure, etc. 

Importantly, Angel makes a further distinction concerning the flexibility of recording data through the concept of an “asset”. An asset, as explained, is a ‘unique ID for a product’. Chief Product Officer, Vlad Trifa has explained an asset as a “document folder that acts as a placeholder for all the information you gather about anything in your supply chain.” What makes the system so flexible is the fact that an asset can possess multiple sub-assets (i.e. a truck, multiple cartons of eggs, and each individual egg). This means that multiple aspects of a single process can be recorded in a clear manner. 

Finally, Angel also discusses how Ambrosus will be capable of scaling to a size that can support all of the data it intends to record. While an individual article in itself should be devoted to explain this, the solution is founded on three concepts: a bundle, an asset, and an event. First, as already explained, an asset is simply ‘a unique ID for a product’. Second, an event, is a ‘unique reading of a sensor, pertaining to that product’. The Asset is the ‘What’, the Event is the ‘place, time, space, relation, quality, etc.’ about the product. Third, a ‘Bundle’ is like a mini-database that can contain 10,000 entries (an entry can be either an asset or an event). 

How do these three concepts fit together to allow Ambrosus to scale smoothly? Well, while AMB-NET would traditionally be capable of processing 50 -70 transactions per second, by ‘Bundling’ supply chain data into compact, mini-databases, the transaction speed of the network can be increased to process 500,000 to 600,000 transactions of assets or events per second, making it highly scalable. Importantly, this uses the Solidity framework (the Ethereum programming language), so all of the Ethereum based solutions can be integrated easily to such a network (i.e. smart contracts, etc.).  
Securing the Data and Token Functionality: In order to secure all of the bundles of data on the network, and to balance between completely private data, and completely public data, Ambrosus makes use of a personalized architecture combining a proof of authority consensus mechanism, with a delegated proof of stake mechanism. According to Angel this balance allows corporates to possess their own data, and at the same time to use a blockchain to prove the quality of their products to consumers or clients. 

The Amber token itself, has a double function in the eco-system: First, 1) it is the digital certificate for any traced product. This means that Amber is tied to each asset/event that is traced and that a company cannot use the eco-system without buying Amber. Second, 2) all transaction fees are also paid and generated in Amber. As such, the eco-system runs on Amber as the lifeline of the network. 

**Multi-Tiered Node System:** Finally, Angel concluded the presentation by discussing the different types of nodes that operate in the Ambrosus eco-system. 
First, there are **Hermes Nodes**: Such nodes are Data Producers. These nodes are API’s that collect data from sensors, document the data, and then create a bundle of this data. They also put a hash (the fingerprint of the bundles) on the blockchain. 

Second, there are **Apollo Nodes**: Such nodes are the validators of the eco-system. They validate the data and transmit it to the rest of the network signaling that the transactions can be approved. 

Both Apollo and Hermes nodes must be permissioned with an SLA (Service Level Agreement) requirement. Simply put: these nodes must function for the system to operate and as such, require more legal guarantee of proper functioning. 

Third, there are **Atlas Nodes**: Such nodes are the Arbiters of the eco-system. They make sure that there is no cheating going on in the network and that the public data is constantly available. Importantly, Angel explained how currently the Ambrosus team is working on designing a ‘Zero Knowledge Proof’ for Atlas nodes, whereby private data can be publicly validated and proven without revealing the data itself. 

Fourth and finally there are Perseus nodes. These nodes are mobile phones, sensors, and devices that interface with the network. 

According to the most recent AMA by Angel, more information will soon be released about the token-economics and node requirements for the community. 

**General Overview:** to give a general summary of the core technology of Ambrosus, one could say the following: Ambrosus is made up of both a blockchain, as well as hardware sensors that communicate with the blockchain (Blockchain + IoT). The combination of IoT with a blockchain allows for tamper-proof data, secured on a blockchain. This data, in turn, can be either internal or external, and is capable of scaling to a very high level through the innovative notion of a ‘bundle’. Finally, the way all of this data will be secured is through a mixture of a Proof of Authority Consensus mechanism, combined with a Delegated Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Hermes, Apollo, and Atlas nodes function to generate, validate, and secure all such data. Finally, the Amber token, tied to each asset of data, is required to operate any part of the eco-system. 

**Part 3: Applications and Industries**

**Examples and Use Cases:** Throughout the presentation, Angel referenced multiple real world scenarios where the Ambrosus solution can be game-changing: First, Angel referenced two statistics showing the loss of profit and life that currently result from the lack of proven quality in food and pharmaceutical products: 1) in the USA alone, 55 billion dollars a year is lost through the mislabeling of products. 2) 200,000 people die each year from fake medicine. 
More specifically, Angel discussed certain use-cases for Ambrosus: 1) concerning Virgin Olive Oil, he mentioned how over 80% of all virgin olive oil was counterfeit. The Ambrosus solution can use chemistry to trace the origin of the olives used by analyzing it bio-chemical makeup. 2) In the meat industry, Ambrosus works with a German quality assurance company to help improve their ability to trace and qualify certain meats. 3) With chocolate producers, Ambrosus can verify the geographical origin of the chocolate – where its milk comes from, and where it was made. 4) Finally, through the tamper-proof sensors discussed above, certain tags can be placed on the caps of certain products like medicine or wine, to guarantee that such products have not been tampered with until they have been consumed. Nevertheless, these examples only begin to touch the surface of what can be monitored. 

**Benefits for Companies and Solutions for the Future:** For companies themselves, Ambrosus possesses a clear value proposition: First and foremost, this pertains to a companies ability to market all aspects of their product. This leads to increased trust from the consumer. Second, the Ambrosus eco-system can be used by different supply-chain stakeholders who simply wish to trace larger shipments of products (i.e. transportation companies). This allows for increased performance.  Third, all of the data can be organized into a clear dashboard to help trace shipments of products, and monitor the quality of such products. This leads to increased efficiency. Fourth and finally, certain Fintech solutions can also be created, specifically concerning how Insurance Companies can trace losses of their clients. Additionally, because of the open-source and developer friendly nature of the Ambrosus eco-system, a large number of applications can also be built on top of AMB-NET. Examples given by Angel include things like ‘Product Recalls’ where specific tools will help show companies where their contaminated products ended up.

**What Should be Recognized:** Blockchain and IoT is a very large area, and at this point there are numerous projects actively building products to solve a large variety of problems for companies. What Angel’s presentation at Crypto Valley should demonstrate however, is that no other solution is tackling food and pharmaceutical products as holistically (internal + external data) and efficiently (bundles) as Ambrosus. Their bottom-up approach, allows for flexibility, customization of sensors, and a holistic, open-source approach to the entire food or pharmaceutical supply chain.

We will spread the questions between Angel and Vlad. Vlad will start. 

**Question 1: We start with a Masternode Question. To store private data, companies will need to purchase a Hermes node with 150,000 tokens. But how are we going to grow and have new big partners if the total supply of tokens is limited and most of the tokens will be locked for the masternodes?** 

**Vlad:** Sure, so the most important thing is to first quickly understand what are the different nodes on the network. So I will just begin with the Apollo Masternodes – they are the ones running the Ambrosus blockchain. So they are essentially validators in the interim sense. Then we have Hermes nodes, those nodes essentially provide an API for all sorts of applications for anyone wanting to write data. These applications sends the information to Hermes nodes and then Hermes nodes take that data and package it up into a bundle and put that bundle onto the blockchain. Then of course you have Atlas nodes, who are going to be storing those bundles. 

What is really important is that the amount of Hermes nodes, and the real value of someone running a Hermes node is that they can build new applications, they can extend the source code of the Hermes node which is open source, they can add a lot of new functionalities and then build new services that they can resell to other companies as well. So if someone is very specialized in one industry they can create a customized Hermes node and then resell it. 

So this means that it is not an issue whatsoever with how many Hermes nodes are on the network. The real, most important metric which we are interested in, is how many bundles are going to be created. So it is more interesting to have a few Hermes Nodes that create a lot of bundles rather than having a lot of Hermes nodes that create very few bundles. So the real metric is how many bundles are created daily. And we are also exploring how developers – how easy it is for someone to start sending data and to start using Hermes Nodes. And we will have our own Hermes nodes and we can provide access to any developers without the need for them to have their own Hermes node. If a big company or someone is using Ambrosus a lot, then it becomes a lot more interesting to set up your own Hermes node. 

**Question 2**: Okay, and speaking of the Atlas nodes which you also mentioned, are they also responsible for challenging other Atlas nodes and thus copying the data? So how does it work beyond the initial 5 challenges, and the reward that will come with them? 

**Vlad:** Sure, so I think as you may have noticed from the last post, we have increased the number from 5 to 7. So every time you create a bundle, which costs $12 USD, 7 dollars will be used to go to 7 Atlas Masternodes, to store a copy of that bundle. What is really important here is what a challenge means. First to do a challenge you have to pay $1 USD equivalent. So anytime someone wants to challenge any Atlas node because he may not have the data, you pay $1 USD and you can challenge that node. Then someone else might say, yes I have got the data from that Apollo node – so that data is available there. And then they will be responsible for sheltering a copy of that data as well. 

So every time another Atlas node answers to a challenge, he will automatically be a copy holder for a new bundle. So for every new challenge on a specific Atlas, there will be one more copy. And don’t forget that every time someone creates a challenge, it costs 1 dollar, and that dollar will go to the new Atlas node in question.  

**Question 3: And are there limitations on copying the data? Can it only be copied five times? And sheltered by only 5 nodes.** 

**Vlad:** There is no upper limit, and that is very interesting because technically anyone can look at the data which is out there, and anyone can copy the data they want, but you need to be challenged and you need to respond to a challenge to earn some Amber tokens and be rewarded. So that is a very important point, there is no upper limit whatsoever. 

**Question 4: Okay so will network speed and location have an impact on rewards for Apollo and Atlas Nodes? Or will there be something like a queue for nodes to capture something like block validation and bundle rewards?** 

**Vlad:** Sure, so for Apollo nodes, there will be no influence on the connectivity and the type of servers. Apollo nodes, because it is a POA network (Proof of Authority) every node will have its turn in order to create. So in the longer term over time, every Apollo node will be rewarded at the same time, and every Apollo node will have the option to mine a block every turn, so there is no difference. 

On the Atlas side, the most important thing is about the speed. Because when someone creates a bundle out there, the seven fastest Atlas nodes that see the challenge, and respond to it, will then be rewarded. But remember there will be a cap on how many bundles an Atlas node can hold. So the main difference is not going to be big. There won’t be two Atlas nodes taking all of the data. There will be enough bundles, especially in the long term to make an equivalence of sharing opportunities. 

**Question 5: Okay Vlad, you also said on Reddit that nodes benefiting from a faster connection will get rewards faster than nodes with a slower connection. So what is the most optimal connection speed, to get the most rewards?** 

**Vlad:** I don’t think it is so much about which speed connection. You need to have a very decent server and the most important thing is that your Atlas node will need, technically speaking, to be able to detect when new bundles are being created on the network. 

So that means the real proximity is how close you are too many Apollo nodes, because they are the main nodes on the network. So geographically, as long as we have nodes distributed, it won’t be better to have a node in South America or in Asia, because that will be distributed enough. And the probability will be more and more equal as the network grows in size. 

**Question 6: So are we right to assume that 250k locked in an Apollo node will always get more returns than 250k locked in an Omega Node?** 

**Vlad:** It is an interesting question. What is important is that Atlas nodes to have a limit on how many bundles they can store, so once you have reached that limit you will have to wait until some of those bundles have expired, but you will always have a cap. That cap we are discussing of course, and there are a few questions about that. That cap is still being finalized. We try to find a tradeoff between network scalability and everyone being able to access the network. So to answer that question there is no such limit on the number of Apollo nodes, and the number of Apollo nodes will be smaller than the number of Atlas nodes. And that means as usage of the network grows, there will be no such cap for Apollo nodes. 

**Question 7: But how many Zeta nodes will be needed on the network?** 

**Vlad:** That is a good question. But it is hard to give a number answer like that. That number will essentially depend on the traffic of the network. So the more bundles that will be created, the more nodes will be opened and imported. Obviously we are trying to find the perfect balance between everyone wanting to run a node – to have the ability to do so in the near future. And obviously the more nodes that there will be the less the rewards can be earned by nodes. So we need to find a very good balance between scalability and providing the service that Ambrosus needs to provide to our customers, and at the same time ensuring that the nodes of everyone participating have a good incentive to do so. 

**Switch to Questions for Angel**

**Question 8: so we can start with KYC. Which KYC will be more rigorous? The KYC for an individual or the KYC for a single member company?** 

**Angel:** So in general the role that the KYC process normally accompanies is that it usually needs to verify the ultimate beneficiary of the company – so who is ultimately getting the profits. So in this case if it is a sole tradership or another kind of legal entity with a sole owner, or manager – then I don’t imagine that the process for such a company will be more complicated in terms of KYC than for an individual. So from that perspective it doesn’t really matter too much. 

As long as the person in question is not under some embargo, or blacklisted, or under some sanctions, it should not be a problem and there should not be a difference between the two. 

**Question 9: Does the place that a company is based, or annual sales or date of establishment, affect the possibility of the company passing or not passing through the KYC?** 

**Angel:** If the company is operating from somewhere with an embargo or any other legal irregularities that will require a close examination. Otherwise the jurisdiction or date of company are not that relevant. Of course for Apollo nodes, we are going to give the preference to some established companies that already have some credibility, because they are going to be the key stakeholders to ensure the integrity of the network. But otherwise we will obviously take care of the needs of the community and we will make sure that it is not only preference for legal entities as opposed to individuals. 

**Question 10: Now let’s talk a little bit about Partnerships. A few months ago in March, Ambrosus announced a partnership with the Swiss Coffee Alliance. The community would like an update on what is going on with this partnership?**  

**Angel**: Yes so the Swiss Coffee Alliance has opened various networks to us that have permitted us to start various negotiations with companies. So we have started developing various use cases, PoC’s (Proof of Concepts) as well as developed a proper app for specifically the Coffee Industry. I think that we shared some of the screen shots in one of the blog posts, but there is a basic app that we are now testing in terms of how it could be used for the coffee industry and how it could help consumers make a better informed choice on what Coffee they buy. So basically how we can better engage consumers. So we are now tweaking the product and iterating on this to make sure that it can feed the needs of the company, as well as responsibly taking care of the interests of the consumers. So we specifically are going to release a blog entry about the coffee app update with a walkthrough, and some actual screen shots of the app, towards the end of August. 

**Question 11: there are people who have said that Ambrosus has released too few partnerships. What is your comment on that?** 

**Angel:** So, in general, on the partnerships it is true that there have been few partnerships that have been made public so far. Corporations are usually quite sensitive to the crypto-sector in general. So there is a lot of red tape and internal things to navigate with these companies. In terms of the technology they are obviously excited to explore it and to see how it works, and they see a lot of benefit in terms of improving their operations as well as providing new streams of revenue and ways to engage the consumers. 

In terms of getting this public however, we need to go through quite a few legal and regulatory aspects that depend on the corporates. So basically the ball is on their side. We are on track with a few companies, and we are making plans to release partnerships in the foreseeable future – so the partnerships will begin in September actually. So we are finalizing some. And one of the main ones will be linked to the documentary. 

**Question 12:** So does Ambrosus have plans or goals to increase the number of companies in its pipeline in the near or mid-term future? If so, can you speak about this? 

**Angel:** Yes that is definitely the goal. And with the expansion to Dublin with the opening of the Irish office that will focus on business development in particular, and engaging the corporates will focus on that part. So the goal is obviously to accelerate the corporate adoption, and to make sure that all of the parties that we have demonstrated the value of AMB-NET in the form of PoC’s or dApps, that we can actually transform those into long term partnerships where such client companies would really adopt the system and integrate them into their supply chains. 

**Question 13: So will new partnerships be unveiled with upcoming Proof of Concepts and the unveiling of the mini-documentary?** 

**Angel:** Yes, so the upcoming documentary movie is going to be not only an overview of what we did, but it is also going to unveil a partnership with one of the companies in the sector. So it will be a real example of the adoption of Ambrosus technology. 

**Question 14: With regards to the numerous NDA’s you spoke about months ago…Are these companies still collaborating with Ambrosus?** 

**Angel:** Yes, so as previously mentioned we have not had a breakdown in negotiations with any of the companies so far. So we are currently iterating on the commercial aspects, as well as defining the product that they wish to use, or that they wish to build on top of AMB-NET. Questions are still ongoing, and none of the companies have dropped out. Currently we are working on how we can deepen this relationship, and how we can communicate this externally. Of course, as has been said, we are working with these large pharmaceutical or food companies, and obviously there is a lot of secrecy involved and it takes a lot of red tape to go through before they are ready to go public with it.

But from that perspective, in terms of those companies that we started engaging with – none of them have actually dropped out – none of them have actually said – hey guys we are not interested. So we are still talking to a lot of them, and we are still iterating the product and building the PoC’s. Importantly, the goal of the new project managers, like people like Philippi Bellintani and other project managers – their specific focus is to drive those collaborations towards public partnerships. 

**Question 15: How many companies have indicated that they are going to use the AMB-NET in the long term?** 

**Angel:** Yes, so quite a lot of them expressed interest, so this is why it is so important that we demonstrate to them how our system works and how our team works. Because importantly, quite a few companies said, you know there are a lot of companies offering blockchain solutions also for the supply chain, and they like the fact on our side that we combine an expertise in IoT (Internet of Things) and the blockchain. As well as the fact that seeing as a lot of people can talk about it – but very few people can execute on this. So the goal on our side, is for the product team and the solutions team to consistently demonstrate that they can deliver the PoC’s and dApps for the companies, and this will encourage them to adopt it long term on the commercial basis. So in that aspect, many of them want to see how we work in practice, and then they will agree to a public partnership and the long term adoption of AMB-NET. But in general they said that the technology itself is highly interesting to them. 

**Question 16: How many of these companies have dApps built specifically for them?** 

**Angel:** Yeah we have built quite a few dApps for these collaborations with companies. Some of those have been unveiled for the community. I think some people in the community have an idea of what dApps we have done. But nonetheless, we are planning in the coming months to make a few blog posts to release more information about the different dApps we have built, and the different use-cases each one has. And the plan is also to open source some of these dApps so people – perhaps someone from the community – has the opportunity to find new potential applications for these applications. 

**Question 17: So do you still stand by your predication of 1 million bundles per day?** 

**Angel:** So in terms of the prediction for 1 million bundles per day, that was in the context of my discussion of long term adoption of AMB-NET. So obviously once we do have the proper adoption of the AMB-NET I don’t see that as an unrealistic result. So yeah in the long term, that is pretty realistic. 

**Question 18: so what is the duration of the NDA’s? How long will they be valid for?** 

**Angel:** The NDA’s themselves, usually the standard ones are for 5 years. Some of them are indefinitely. The point is that the NDA can only be lifted if the company or counterparty agrees to it. So in this case if the company is ready to go public then they will be able to say, okay we are ready to go public and break the collaboration. 

**Question 19: someone asked Angel, what is your favorite holiday destination?** 

**Angel:** Well I haven’t had holiday for a few years so I wouldn’t know how to answer that question. 

**Vlad Starts to Answer Questions Again**

**Question 20: Vlad we know you are still running solutions, and there are many determinants to consider for making AMB-NET running as efficiently as possible is in all of our interests. But as node holders, naturally the community is very interested in terms of the limitations of the nodes. So even if the numbers are not finalized, what is the ballpark estimate of the number of bundle quotas for each Atlas node?** 

**Vlad:** It is clearly one of the numbers that I mentioned before that we are still evaluating. We do have a certain sweet spot that we think we have identified, we just want to run the necessary tests, and especially as we have just soft launched main-net, literally a few days ago, in practice. We start now onboarding private node holders. From August onwards, we will start onboarding more and more community nodes as well. The community will be able to run some nodes, and for that we mentioned in the last post, that we will be sending an application form through our newsletter. And that exact number we are still waiting to have all of the data and simulations necessary. 

In short, maybe larger than you think. Which in short this means that the more data you are storing, the more Amber you will be rewarded. So it is not necessarily a bad thing that his number is bigger than you think. That is all I can say for that. 

**Question 21: How Many Atlas and Apollo Nodes will be added when AMB-NET 1.1 is launched? Will there be an auction system for Apollo Nodes as well?** 

**Vlad:** Again, I think that that will first and foremost depend on how many bundles are created on the network. And that will depend on how quickly we are able to progress on those large customer projects. The most important thing around that is that we have been exploring and discussing the notion of Apollo nodes, and one thing which we have recently evaluated is the ability for a quota – and I see some questions about the max cap. 

We are investigating how that quota can be increased over time. So that means that the best Atlas nodes out there, who are doing a really good job, who are really always online and provide an excellent performance to the network, they will also be rewarded over time with the maximum amount of bundles they can hold. 

Equally for this auction system, that will not be the only way to get a node. That will be one mechanism from which we will be taking and onboarding new nodes. And as we also mentioned other factors will be equally important: how long you have been supporting the community for, what is your technical experience, and also one of the most important factors will be running a node on the test-net. So for the test-net we will be more easily and more rapidly onboarding the nodes so you can get a hand and see what is working with literally no risk on your side. And based on your performance on test-net and how that goes, then we will be onboarding more and more. 

**Question 22: Can an Apollo Node be run by a company even if it is controlled by an individual who is already running an Apollo Node?** 

**Vlad:** So that is a very important question, our policy on that so far has been to make sure that there is only one Apollo node to the same entity. Now if someone has one node privately, and wants to apply as a business for a second Apollo node, we will look into that but it is unlikely that this would be allowed, especially in the first stages, as we are really, really keen to keep our network as decentralized as possible. That is a long term strategy to ensure that we have an equal quantity of nodes that are owned by our partners – the customers and companies working with us and ourselves, and equally with the community. And it is important that we keep those three in balance to ensure that the interests of the AMB-NET is shared among these various stakeholders. 

**Question 23: How does a company actually buy the Apollo node? Do they buy the Apollo node through the team or which way?** 

**Vlad:** So it is not really buying again – for an Apollo node, it is a deposit. The efficient way to be able to do that is that as soon as we announce through our Newsletter, then there will be an application form. Everyone who is interested in running a node – determines whether they wish to run an Atlas, or an Apollo and must submit an application. The faster you can do this the better, as this will provide us with information and we will rapidly have a better understanding of the desire of the community. To run and participate into that. That will play a role in the selection of those nodes. Not necessarily the most important criteria, but you need to fill in this form first – this application. Once we understand how this works, we will be opening more and more slots. So it will get easier to onboard new nodes. 

And all of the details and all of the technicalities of how that is done – essentially once you apply we on our side will try to elaborate and allow you to get a spot for those nodes over time. And as soon as we have a spot for you, we will notify you over email and say, now you have the ability to run a node, and you will then have a certain period of time – a certain time window – during which you will have to deposit that amount into a smart contract. 

As soon as you would deposit that amount into a smart contract, your spot would essentially be held there. And that would be a necessary requirement for you to be able to run an Apollo or an Atlas node. And it is until the time you want to retire and stop operating a node – that deposit will be there. It will only ever be used in case you are misbehaving with the network. Or if there are any other malicious activities that we can detect. Otherwise it will be returned as soon as you want to stop running a masternode, and your spot will go to someone else. So it is really important for you to try to understand this process. We will try to have as many community members running a node as quickly as possible. And we are trying to make the best model possible, to make sure that everyone is essentially satisfied. 

**Question 24: And exactly how many Masternodes will be activated at Launch and each time from then on?** 

**Vlad:** Again, same question as before – I think that will really depend on how many bundles are on the network and how well nodes are performing on the test network. That will allow us to do a lot more simulations. Then with our learnings and simulations from the test net we will be able to know how many more spots we can open up on the Main-net, as well as when is the right time to do so. And as I said, the performance and work that you will be doing on the test-net will be a factor of how quickly you can earn a spot on the main-net. 

**Question 25: So what is the priority of acquiring a masternode spot? There are two people: a person who participated in TGE and then traded their AMB around, or a person who participated in the TGE but never traded. Which one will get priority?** 

**Vlad:** differs to Angel. 

**Angel:** Yeah I think that was the same question as one I got. So in general there was a question where somebody who has held tokens for a longer time with a smaller amount is going to be less prioritized than someone with a higher amount held over a shorter period of time. In general, for the first part we thought that no matter how small the holding is, as long as it qualifies for a Zeta – those who have held it longer will get a priority over those who have a bigger amount – who got or held their AMB for a shorter period of time. Second, in terms of whether it has been traded or not, we consider it as an uninterrupted storage of Amber. So basically AMB-NET users will have to stake their tokens into the masternode to provide the integrity of the network, and for that to serve as a kind of mechanism to ensure their own behavior. Thus to mirror this behavior we will also look at if Amber has been in the same wallet or not. So we will look at those who have held Amber the longest, without moving it around. 

**Question 26: So is there a limit on the number of Apollo nodes that can exist?** 

**Vlad:** So of course there is, in theory a limit, what is important for us, is to ensure the growth of our system. So a lot of the research we will be doing over the next two months – a lot of that research will go towards seeing how we can increase the number of Apollo nodes, without affecting the performance of the nodes already in the network – their operations and how they work. So we are really looking into that, and the ability to scale. Technically, there is no upper limit of course, and the priority is to make sure that the network works as behaved and as required. And that the performance that our corporate customer needs is there – that the reliability, the security is there. And as soon as we get those tests passing and that develop, then of course we will be opening more and more new slots. So we definitely don’t want to put a hard line in the sand and say yeah that is the maximum amount of tokens – other networks might try to use those techniques. We are not interested in that – we are much more interested in ensuring growth of our network for the community and of course for companies who are using it. 

**Question 27: Why is the team not implementing daily rewards, instead of every 28 days?** 

**Vlad:** So the first answer is performance. If we were to do daily rewards to a lot of masternodes that means a lot of transactions, and a lot of transactions means much less bandwidth to do more important non-reward based transfers. So performance is the first answer. And second, why 28? Because it is 4 weeks, and a month is four weeks, and we like good numbers, and that is the most interesting aspect. We just found that, you know, 28 days is a fair number…maybe there is another question afterwards coming to that as well. 

**Questions Switch back to Angel** 

**Question 28: A few of us have voiced our concerns about no email responses after signing up for the newsletter. Is the newsletter working properly?** 

**Angel:** Yeah, so to my knowledge we have fixed that part, so it should be working well, maybe, actually I don’t know Vlad if people will get the confirmation when they sign up. 

**Vlad:** Yeah that is an important point, and something we need to check. There should be a way for community to verify that. I know that there was a bug being reported, so the sign up was working, and we did get a lot of new signups in the last few days. But there was a bug on the actual library we are using on WordPress, and that didn’t remove the spinner of those subscriptions. So if you had subscribed in the last few days we would have got those subscriptions. So I think the confirmation is an important point, and the ability as well just for anyone to check – that is something we can write down and put in place – as I think that is valuable. But in short, if you are not sure, just sign up once more and give another address if you have any doubts. Then when you are applying for a node, just use the comments box (as there will be a comments box) and say hey, I have signed up already, this is the email address that I used for the TGE. 

The more information you provide us, the easier it will be for us to do a fair and balanced selection of those nodes. 

**Question 29: Angel, you previously mentioned this mini-documentary about the pilot project. Will it be available on YouTube?** 

**Angel:** Yes it will definitely be on our channel and we are planning to release it in the first week of September. 

**Question 30: Previously it has been mentioned that for now Ambrosus already has a number of proof of concepts (PoC’s) and companies in their pipelines. And so they are not so focused at the moment in researching out new clients. Can you comment some more on why this is the case?** 

**Angel:** Yes, so in terms of getting new people on board the point is that the new clients – the first few meetings with companies – that is the easy part. When you actually introduce the technology, you verify with them that they are interested in this, and you are looking for solutions with them to digitalize their supply chain or to improve their processes.

Many companies are interested in this, so getting kind of a new client in this sense of the first outreach – that is the easy part. However, it is when we actually bring it down, as a commercial partnership, this is when it becomes a more challenging issue, and where more workforce is needed. 

So from that perspective when I mentioned in the AMA that we are going to focus on closing those deals, it means that we are putting more effort and more manpower on securing partnerships with companies, with who we have already started working with, and with who we are already running PoC’s with or who we are running a pilot with. And then of course, also in parallel, we are going to onboard new clients, whenever possible. 

**Question 31: How long will it take enterprise to integrate to AMB-NET if they choose it? Is it time consuming and needs a step by step adoption, or can they migrate all of their products onto AMB-NET if they deem the PoC successful?** 

**Angel:** So this depends on the level of integration that they want. Either they can sync and run our network and run our nodes and products – so we obviously put them out there – they are open source. So the companies can technically use their own IT teams to launch them. Or they can also use, kind of our – we call it – blockchain as a service, whereby we can actually run a Hermes node for them, delivering services and recording transactions, and then they simply just make use of those services. And in that case, they don’t need any time to migrate to AMB-NET so to say – they simply integrate it into their existing solutions and that means that the rest of the job is taken care of by AMB-NET. 

So another aspect that I would say is important is that using another system is not only a technical question but it is also a question of training the employees of the companies. So it is also important for us, also, to make our tools easy to use, and the UI that is intuitive for people. And this we hope has been evident in the products we have released and also in the screen shots of some of the dashboards that we have released and so on for the supply chain. That it intends to be simple to use and elegant. So this is the point that we want this option to be as seamless as possible. 

**Question 32: I live in a heartland of forestry and logging, and tracking timber is costly and full of paperwork – both from a harvesting and distribution point of view. I think that Ambrosus could be used to track timber, but also from curbing illegal logging globally. Is it possible that Ambrosus can expand to this area?** 

**Angel:** So in general, digitalization of supply chains, and track and trace, and validating where the product has originated from and what has happened to it, is a valuable application. And then it has got promise in a range of markets. That also includes, obviously the timber industry. So I would say that we obviously welcome, any such suggestions. 

And especially the person – you mentioned that the community member actually lives in the area and maybe there are businesses around it. We always appreciate these leads or the development of use-cases on top of AMB-NET. Obviously our team cannot handle all of the possible use-cases out there. At the same time if anybody comes with particular proposals and can offer some use-cases we will be happy to provide a reward, and also to provide the tools necessary for this company to use AMB-NET. 

So we are building our tools, to be used universally. So we have selected for ourselves food, pharmaceuticals, and commodities, to focus on. But in general if the community finds new applications for AMB-NET, we are more than happy for them to explore it. And for them, whenever possible we will also support them on that. 

**Question 33: Outside of the food and pharmaceutical industries, are there any other industries that can benefit greatly from the use of AMB-NET and its sensors?** 

**Angel:** So we have been developing quite a few Proof of Concepts in the ‘Commodities Sector’. So it is obviously a huge area and a huge market. And as mentioned in the previous comment a lot of the applications we build for food and pharmaceuticals, can easily be applied there. So we are talking about where the materials came from, also what happened to them on the way – quality assurance, ownership and traceability. So from that perspective we can simply make use of the same technology we have built for food and pharmaceutical products and apply them in the commodities sector. And we are already talking to some companies on that front – and these are big markets. 

Some other use cases that we have been developing are for luxury goods as well as for kind of electronic equipment and spare parts. Again it all comes down to the verdict of traceability. Just finding where the product comes from, and having that as a trusted record on the platform. So from that perspective we are trying to create tools that can be versatile and that can be applied to a wide variety of markets, and that many companies could perhaps discover it, and make use of them, and we will just be building additional tools. 

The important thing is that we want all of these tools to help grow the usage of AMB-NET. And based on that, if many industries start using it of course we will be very happy. 

**Question 34: What do you currently project the conversion rate to be from presentation to proof of concept and from proof of concept to onboarding of AMB-NET? How effective are these proof of concepts?** 

**Angel:** Yes so, from that perspective its related to what I started mentioning about kind of the initial outreach versus the kind of what turns into the proof of concept, and then ultimately into an account. So in general companies are of course interested. But then converting them to – well first there are multiple risks of course for the company.

The first one is that blockchain itself is a new technology. And they want to see to what extent can they actually put their operations onto supply chains, which for the companies we are dealing with that is the livelihood of their business – they cannot afford for these supply chains to just be disrupted, they cannot afford for the data to be corrupted because they can potentially lose billions of dollars in value, they can have some fines, and so on. So from that perspective they have to rigorously test out this solution before they can take a decision to ultimately adopt it or integrate it into the supply chains. 

And if they do actually find value for that – perhaps in one particular use case – or a product, then we use that to actually have a proper kind of large scale pilot project, to prove to them that the technology is valuable for them. And then they can see how it works – they can calculate the risks, and then they can educate their employees, and from then on, they can expand. 

So I would say that the funnel is actually converging quite fast. So perhaps a lot of companies would be interested, but very few of them would move to the next stage. But we will go with those that are interested in making their supply chains more transparent. Or those that do want to prove the quality of their products – and that is becoming an increasingly important aspect in this competitive industry. 

**Questions Switch Back to Vlad**

**Question 35: Would Ambrosus ever consider in the future lowering the Atlas Masternodes requirement to less than 10,000 AMB?** 

**Vlad:** So I will say that it is quite unlikely that we will do that. I think we are – and this is why we are fine tuning these numbers – attempting to ensure that there is no reason to reduce that number. What would be very interesting is by making members of the community or those members who will be running those nodes – they might want to explore the option of pooling different smaller token holders together to run a node together. If someone wants to do that – we definitely won’t prevent them from making that happen. I think there are many, many opportunities like this one to be discussed, that we haven’t found ourselves. So if someone in the community wants to expose us to this kind of stuff further, we would be very interested to discuss. You can always reach out, and we can always discuss that option more specifically. 

**Question 36: If someone used a Ledger to store their ERC20 tokens, are they still able to onboard just as fast to stake for a node? Or will they have to wait until ledger support arrives?** 

**Vlad:** I don’t think that is really an issue. So for the moment, and I think we mentioned this as well in our last update, we will keep both ERC20 tokens and the native tokens in parallel for a while. The reasons for that are obvious – first on the one hand there is a lot of ERC20 support on exchanges, in the ledger, on those hardware wallets for example. That is one thing we want to leverage and profit from. And at the same time have the benefits of the native currency. There will of course be a one-on-one mapping. I do not think there will be a major difference in that – because the onboarding will happen when there will be a slot assigned to you, after you have applied – and you will have a certain time window to do that transfer. 

**Question 37: So will rewards be awarded after each challenge and just have it distributed by the smart contract every four weeks? Or will rewards be awarded once every 4 weeks?** 

**Vlad:** No, so the way it will work is that every time an Atlas node accepts a challenge – he will get to store a bundle for a specific period of time. Every bundle will have a duration which is a number of years. So for example someone who owns a Hermes Node – this Hermes Node run by a big German company doing something in whatever industry – they will be the ones to upload that bundle right? And they will be paying $12 USD for that bundle to be stored for the duration they select. If they want to hold it for 5 years that is going to be $60 USD for that bundle. So what happens is whoever gets the response to that challenge – they would be holding that bundle for five years. And so the total fraction which will be 1 dollar per year times 5 years would be five dollars. 

The way it would work is that Atlas node would essentially be rewarded with those five dollars over five years. And how it works is that those five dollars will be cut in factors of 28 days and up to 65%. That means during the entire five years, you will get up to the 65% and only when you have completed the entire storage duration, your part of the deal as an Atlas node holder, then you will get the last 35% paid in the last reward component.

Angel I know these are testing times, when it feels like all hope is forlorn and the burden of the world is upon you. The real test of character is forged and proven under the fires of criticism and doubt.

This is not the Angel we all know who cracks under the pressure of its demanding 1000 AMB board members. 

This is not the Angel we know who birthed the chad ceo meme.

This is not the Angel, the fighter, we know who would fight tooth and nail for those who supported him in tough times.

I will not chastise those who hold AMB and have lost perhaps a significant value of their portfolio. They have every right to be concerned. No... This message is not for them. This is for you.

Curious about the prospects of Ambrosus's partnership news in early September leading to a major pump. We saw with VEN and WTC, for instance –two coins with major Chinese ""cartel"" backing/and social marketing leading them to become more well known and traded even though their product/team/etc. aren't as good as Ambrosus'.

And has Ambrosus considered reaching out to Data Dash, other prominent YouTube reviewers like In It For The Money, Suppoman, Vincent Briatore, etc. Reaching out to CryptoCue,SharkCIA etc as well?

I am mainly curious as to how Ambrosus plans to deal with the issue of marketing and social interest in this because in the event of solid partnerships I am concerned it not be significantly noticed by the market, and investors would like to see more adoption in the token on partnership announcement. So knowing what Ambrosus's plans on marketing towards the retail market and respect for investors/traders would inspire more confidence that retail investors/traders do matter, and not only corporate customers.

Of course long term interest matters, but to get there short-term interest is needed to get there. That's why a coin like Verge which doesn't do anything original, and is buggy, still has a $200 million market cap, and $10 million trading interest in 24 hours.

I want to make sure i understand how data storage and challenges work for Atlas nodes because i might be a bit confused. It seems to me that when a bundle is created, the request to store that data goes out to nodes. The node who responds fastest will shelter the data and receive the AMB reward to do so. At the same time, a challenge is also initiated which sends a request to 7 other nodes to verify data integrity. So again the 7 fastest nodes that respond to the request will perform the challenge and verify data (on another node) is intact, thereby providing the data security function. The nodes that perform a challenge will receive a reward in AMB. Can anyone confirm this is correct?


PS - The AMA questions by Vlad and Angel were very thorough with regard to understanding how this all works.  i very much appreciate the time they spent responding to the community inquiries

Maybe the navigation could be changed so you are drawn into and through the keyhole to reveal the rest of the website?.I know the complete logo exists in the far top left corner but it's small and I think very easily overlooked.

As a disclaimer, none of this should be taken as investment advice – I trust you to consult an investment professional for advice when investing. That being said, I also trust that you will keep in mind the time frame on this project and not get short-sighted over irrelevant things. 

**Point 1: A Little Reality Check** 

The reason why you are probably here is because you’re interested in cryptocurrency, blockchain, and innovation. I think when we talk about Masternodes people get greedy and they actually forget about the simply utility of the Amber token (AMB) and what that token will be effectively doing. 

So to bring us all back down to reality, I want to point out a couple of things that should be remembered when we talk about Ambrosus: First, that Ambrosus is not like pretty much any other cryptocurrency. And the reason for this is because Ambrosus is building an enterprise solution for large corporations to improve all aspects of their supply chain – its visibility, data movement, security, brand name, etc. As a consequence of this focus, you cannot look at Ambrosus like you look at other projects. In pretty much every other project you will get a scenario that looks more or less like this: 

“We are going to build a product, and then once our product is built, we are going to get tons of people to use it, and that will make it really successful and the price of the token will go up because so many people will start to use it.” 

Notice how in this scenario, all of the product launches and releases are done pretty much prior to any major adoption. This attitude does not apply to Ambrosus. Because as we know, Ambrosus is building a product that is being tested by companies. Real, big, large, money filled corporations. Not some random dude who might want to try out the platform – an actual business giant that needs the services Ambrosus has. The point is that this cannot be forgotten when we hear things about how the client companies cannot be revealed yet. No corporation will use a network unless they are sure about it, and they can only be sure about it if they take the time to look at it thoroughly. So from the outset, recognize that this project is doing something real, and as such doesn’t follow the normal rules. 

**Point 2: No One Else Is Doing This**

I think this point more than any other has really been forgotten due to all of the masternode hype and greed. No one else – either private or public – blockchain has the scope and applicability like Ambrosus does. And I really mean this. Ambrosus is preparing itself as an industrial grade supply chain solution. That means that if you are a food company – check Ambrosus applies. If you are a pharmaceutical company – check Ambrosus applies. If you are a commodities company – check Ambrosus applies. High Luxury product – check. Restaurant chain – check. Chemical or Agribusiness Company – check. Precious metals Company – check. 

So we are talking about the fact that within the 1,400 cryptocurrency projects, there is only one that has taken the public blockchain model, kept it open-sourced, and is still going to be able to apply it real world industries that are well into the hundreds of billions of dollar in total value. 

So zoom out a second on the timeframe: in about 10 months, from a team of 10 people, to a team now of more than 40 people, more than 200 – 300 NDA’s have been signed, and there are over 30 real time pilot projects functioning. Think about that for a second. Time wise, that was where Bitcoin was in 2010. Or Ethereum in the middle of 2015. That is how young Ambrosus is, and that is how much potential Ambrosus has in light of how young they are. 

Now step back for a second again, and imagine just as Bitcoin took about 8 years to get mainstream, and Ethereum took a good 2 and a half years to do the same – where do you think Ambrosus will be in a year and a half from now? That is the question you need to be asking yourself. Not, “when will I get onto the network to stake my node.” Do not let short-sighted greed get in front of long-term fundamental analysis. 

**Point 3: Demand for AMB**	

The final point I want to drive in is that irrelevant of Masternodes, there is going to be serious demand for AMB as the system picks up traction. Let me explain to you my reasoning why: First, we know that all companies who use the eco-system will be required to pay for that service in AMB. Second, we know that the partnerships that Ambrosus is currently working on are long term partnerships that will be used for industrial grade supply chains. 
What does this mean? It means that every time Ambrosus secures a partnership, they don’t just secure it as a onetime thing – i.e. “hooray we got to partner with X company and now they will use the network”. Rather they secure a partnership for a long-term collaboration – i.e. “Hooray we just got partner X to use the Ambrosus network for the next 5 to 10 years. 

Now how does that affect the demand for AMB? Well it means that if you are calculating the value of the token in the future. You need to take into account current partnerships + all future partnerships as well. 

Think of it like this: Let’s say Company A is using AMB now, and then Company B, C, D, and E sign up. Now we have Companies A,B,C,D and E, using AMB. Then Companies F,G,H,I and J sign up. But still at the same time A,B,C,D, and E are also using the network. So that means every year without any new partnerships, Companies A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I, and J all re-use the same network they have always been using. This is like a massive snowball effect. 

If you think of it like this over the long term this literally, literally means there is going to be very high demand for the Amber token if the company can successfully bring corporates onboard. Based on the fact that in the first 7 months they have 30 Proof of Concepts – and that has been without a fully launched product yet – think about how that will grow over the next 2 to 3 years. 

**Conclusion:** 

So basically, I want the moon boys to calm down and for people to think more deeply about just how fundamentally sound Ambrosus is. Not only is it here to stay, but for the amount of time that it has been around, it’s been growing at an absurdly quick rate.

Although I can easily claim that I'm solely interested in the tech and not the price, I admit that I hope price stays down for more time to accumulate, but alas I wish I had more fiat before partnership and imminent industrial grade main-net soon.


Just a reminder, ignore the paid FUDsters trying to get in cheap. Price is being manipulated by whales and they are thanking those who panic sell. Selling now is like selling ETH at $3 in 2017.


So here is my piece of advice- delete your blockfolio and come see this thread age well exactly a year from now.

Peace and blessings to fellow AMBros

It's one of my favourite projects hands down and I checkout many (MANY) other projects.  

It baffles me that marketing has this much impact. Other projects generate more hype with fake partnerships and empty promises without having achieved anything!  

Anyways I'm pretty confident, that a competent team like theirs will perform eventually.

EPF Lausanne and ETH Zürich are pretty much the best academic institutes on the European Continent and at least there Ambrosus seems to be quite prominent.

    
So enjoy the very cheap Atlas nodes, buckle down, be patient and enjoy.

I think they wer relevant some time ago, with the information we had back then, but now, as there is more clarification on tokenomics subject, I think some of that changed. 

Here is my reply from another thread:

&gt;I think these calculations are no longer relevant as the tokenomics got more specified.  
&gt;  
&gt;E.g. Hermes node will not receive any payout, in fact, Hermes is actually paying the network.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the most important change/clarification is that there will be a cap on how much data can one node store. So with that in mind, I would assume that the profit from running a MN would not be as high as expected. However it should still be a decent profit.  
&gt;  
&gt;edit: also the bundle payout distribution will be different, I think.. One bundle will be paying out to 7 Atlas nodes, which means that each node will be rewarded with 1 dollar for the storage of 1 year. So I think this is also very important change in assumption on calculating the profit. But don't quote me on that, I may be wrong.

What is your opinion guys? I would like to discuss it a bit more. Thanks.",NA,"98rn7b",NA,0,NA,"false",1536780588,"false","self","t5_3mh72","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/ambrosus/comments/98rn7b/are_mn_calculations_no_longer_relevant/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

8月1日に行われた、VladとエンジェルへのライブAMAの中から、一部質問を選んで日本語に訳しました。長いですが、興味のある方はチェックしてみて下さい。

(質問1)：マスターノードについての質問から始めます。プライベートなデータを保存するためには、企業は150,000のトークンでHermesノードを購入する必要があります。しかし、トークンの全体供給量が限られていて、かつトークンの大部分がマスターノードに確保されている場合、どのようにここから成長して新たなパートナーを獲得するのでしょうか？

Vlad：重要なのは、ネットワーク上のさまざまなノードの違いについて理解することです。まず、アポロ・マスターノードの説明から始めましょう - 彼らはアンブロサスのブロックチェーンを実際に動かしているノードです。なので、アポロは、検証者としての役割があると言えるでしょう。

次に、エルメスのノードがあります。エルメスは、あらゆる種類のアプリケーション用のAPIを提供する役割を持っています。これらのアプリケーションは情報をエルメスノードに送信し、次にエルメスノードはそのデータを取り出してバンドルにまとめ、そのバンドルをブロックチェーンに配置します。

そしてもちろん、これらのバンドルを格納するアトラスノードもあります。

ここで重要なのは、エルメスノードの本当の価値は、エルメスコードを動かしている人が、新しいアプリケーションを構築できること、エルメスノードのソースコード(オープンソースになっています)を拡張できること、新しい機能を追加し、新しいサービスを構築して、他の企業に新たに売ることができるということです。

だから例えば、誰かが非常に1つの業界に特化している場合、彼らはカスタマイズされたエルメスノードを作成し、それを他の企業に売ることができます。

つまり、エルメスノードがいくつネットワーク上にあるかは問題ではありません。最も重要な点は、いくつのバンドルが作成されるかということです。だから、少しのバンドルしか作成しないエルメスノードが沢山存在するよりも、沢山のバンドルを作成するエルメスノードが少数存在する方が、おもしろいのです。

ですから、実際の測定基準は、毎日作成されるバンドルの数です。私たちは、開発者がどのようにデータを送信し始め、Hermesノードを使い始めることができるか、またそれをいかに簡単に行えるかを検討しています。そして、私たちアンブロサス自身も、エルメスノードを持って、開発者たちにアクセスできるようにしようとしています。この場合、開発者自身がエルメスノードを持つ必要は無くなります。大きな会社や誰かがアンブロサスをたくさん使っている場合は、自分でエルメスノードを設定するのも、もっと面白くなるはずです。

(質問2)：アトラスノードについて質問です。アトラスノードは、ほかのアトラスノードに挑戦してデータをコピーする責任も負っていますか？

最初の5つのチャレンジが終わったら、その後はどうなりますか？また、その場合の報酬についても教えて下さい。

Vlad：最後のポストを読んで気付いている人もいると思いますが、私たちはチャレンジの数を「5」から「7」に変更しました。だから、1つバンドルを作るたびに（バンドルは12ドルです）、7ドルがそのバンドルのコピーを保存するために7つのアトラスマスターノードに送られます。

ここで重要なのは、「挑戦」が何を意味するかということです。まず、挑戦をするには、1米ドル相当額を払う必要があります。例えば、データを持っていないかもしれないアトラスノードに、挑戦したいとします。その場合、$ 1を支払い、そのノードに挑戦することができます。そうすると、他の誰かが、「私はそのアポロノードからのデータを持っています」と言うかも知れません、その場合データは利用可能な状態で、彼らはそのデータのコピーを保存する責任があります。

つまり、アトラスノードがチャレンジに応答するたびに、自動的にそのノードは、新しいバンドルのコピー所有者になります。したがって、特定のアトラスの新たなチャレンジごとに、1つのコピーが生まれます。そして、誰かがチャレンジを作成するたびに1ドルのコストがかかることを忘れないでください。その1ドルはその新しいアトラスノードに移動します。

(質問3):　データをコピーするときに、制限はありますか？　例えば、5回までしかコピーできませんか？

Vlad:上限はありません。技術的に、誰でもデータを見ることが出来て、また誰でもそのデータをコピーすることができます。しかし、アンバートークンを稼ぐためには、あなたはチャレンジを受け・またチャレンジに応答する必要があります。

(質問4)：ネットのスピードや、どこから接続しているか（場所）は、アポロとアトラスのノードの報酬に影響しますか？

また、ブロックを検証したりバンドルの報酬をキャプチャするための、ノードの順番待ちのようなものがありますか？

Vlad：アポロノードの場合、接続性やサーバーの種類は影響しません。アポロノードはPOAネットワークであるため、すべてのノードに作成するチャンスがあります。だから長期的には、すべてのアポロノードに同時に報酬が与えられるようになり、どのアポロノードも毎回ブロックを採掘する選択肢が与えられるようになると考えられます。

アトラスの話に移ると、最も重要なのはスピードです。誰かがそこにバンドルを作成したときに、チャレンジを見てそれに最も早く応答した７つのアトラスノードが報酬を受けるからです。

と言っても、アトラスノードが保持できるバンドル数に上限があることに注意してください。したがって、違いはそこまで大きくならないでしょう。すべてのデータを２つのアトラスノードがかっさらうようなことは起こりません。

長期的には、多くの人に機会が与えられるくらい、十分な数のバンドルがあるはずです。

(質問10)：Ambrosusのパートナーシップについて質問があります。今年の3月、AmbrosusはSwiss Coffee Allianceとの提携を発表しました。コミュニティはこのパートナーシップに関するアップデートを知りたいと思っています。

エンジェル： Swiss Coffee Allianceとの提携のおかげで、私たちは新たな業界内のつながりを得、様々な企業との交渉をスタートすることができました。そして我々は、様々なユースケース、PoCの開発に着手し、特にコーヒー産業に向けたアプリを開発しました。過去のブログ記事でそのスクリーンショットをいくつか共有したと思いますが、今ベーシックなアプリがあり、それを、コーヒー業界でそれがどのように使用できるのか、また消費者が購入するコーヒーを選ぶため、より良い情報を得るためにどのように役立つかという観点から、テストしています。

だから私たちは現在、製品の調整を行い、消費者の利益を確実に処理するだけでなく、会社のニーズを満たすことができるかどうかを確認するために繰り返しテストを行っています。具体的には、8月末頃に、アプリの実際のスクリーンショットと共に、コーヒーアプリのアップデートに関するブログ記事をリリースするつもりです。

(質問11)：アンブロサスがあまりにも少ない数のパートナーシップしか発表していないという意見もあります。これに関して、どう思いますか？

エンジェル：確かに、これまで公開されたパートナーシップが少ないというのは事実です。企業は通常、一般的に仮想通貨の分野において、非常に慎重です。だから、これらの会社と一緒に仕事するに当たっては、少し官僚主義的だったり、内部で色々と融通を利かせないといけないことがあります。しかし、私たちが持つテクノロジーに関しては、企業は高い関心を示しています。機能に興味があるというだけでなく、オペレーションを改善し、新たな収益を得たり、消費者を巻き込む方法として様々な利点をアンブロサスの技術に見出してくれています。

しかし、これを簡単に公にできる訳ではありません。企業が遵守しなくてはいけない法律、また規制を解決しなくてはいけません。だから、基本的に公表できるかどうかは彼らの側にかかっています。私たちはいくつかの企業と歩調を合わせており、近い将来パートナーシップをリリースする計画を立てています。パートナーシップは実は、9月に開始されます。だから我々は今いくつかのパートナーシップの最終仕上げをしているところです。主要なパートナーシップの１つは、私たちがリリースするドキュメンタリーにも関係があります。

(質問13)：今後のパートナーシップは、今後のProof of Conceptsとミニドキュメンタリーの発表によって明らかになりますか？

エンジェル：はい、今後のドキュメンタリー映画は、私たちが行ったことの概要だけでなく、ある企業とのパートナーシップも明らかにする予定です。 Ambrosusテクノロジーが実際にどのように採用されているのか、見ることができるでしょう。

(質問14)：数ヶ月前に、NDAの数々について話していましたよね……。これらの企業はまだAmbrosusと協力していますか？

エンジェル：はい、これまで述べたように、これまでのいずれの企業との交渉でも一つも決裂したものはありません。したがって、我々は現在、商業的側面を確認したり、彼らがどのような製品を使いたいのか定義したり、またはAMB-NETの上に構築したい製品を定義したりしています。

こうした問いはまだ進行中であり、今までにどの企業も途中で辞めたことはありません。現在、我々はこの関係をいかに深めることができるか、そしてこれを外部にどのように伝えることができるかに取り組んでいます。もちろん、これまで述べたように、私たちは大手製薬会社や食品会社と仕事をしています。明らかに多くの秘密が関与しており、公開準備が整う前に多くの官僚主義的な煩雑な手続きが必要です。

質問に戻ると、我々が話を進めた企業のうち、実際に辞退した企業はありません。「興味ないよ」と言ってきた企業も一つもありません。

私たちはまだ多くの人と話していますが、私たちはまだ製品を繰り返し確認して、PoCを構築しています。

重要なことは、Philippi Bellintaniや他のプロジェクトマネージャーが目指しているのは、それらの今起きているコラボレーションが公式なパートナーシップへと発展するようにすることです。

(質問16)：これらの企業のうち、dAppsを具体的に構築している企業はいくつですか？

エンジェル：企業とのコラボレーションのために実はかなりの数のdAppsを構築しました。それらの内いくつかはコミュニティに既に発表されていると思います。コミュニティメンバーの皆さんは、私たちがどんなdAppsを作ったのか既にアイディアがあると思います。

それに加えて、私たちはあと数ヶ月の間に、私たちが構築したさまざまなdAppsと、ユースケースについてブログ記事を作成する予定です。また、これらのdAppの一部をオープンソース化する計画もあります。コミュニティのメンバーが、これらのアプリケーションのために、新しいアプリケーションを開発する機会を与えるためです。

(質問17)：あなたはまだ1日に100万バンドルという数を予測していますか？

エンジェル：「1日に100万バンドル」という予測は、AMB-NETの長期的な採用についての文脈で行ったものです。 AMB-NETを適切に採用すれば、私はそれが非現実的な結果であるとは思えません。だからそうですね、質問に答えると、長期的には、その数字はかなり現実的だと思っています。

(質問20)：ノード所有者として、ノードの数にとても興味があります。まだ確定されていないのは分かっていますが、Atlasノードごとのバンドル数の推定値はどれくらいですか？

Vlad：私たちは既に、これでちょうどいいのではないかと特定している数字があります。しかし、テストしなければなりません。特に、私たちは数日前にメインネットをローンチしたばかりです。現在、プライベートノードホルダーのオンボーディングを開始しています。 8月以降、より多くのコミュニティノードの参加を開始させます。コミュニティはいくつかのノードを実行することができます。

ニュースレターでアプリケーションを送付します。

正確な数字については、すべてのデータとシミュレーションを待たなくてはいけません。

それは、あなたが思っているよりも大きい数字かもしれません。格納するデータが多いほど、アンバーに与えられる報酬も多いことを意味します。だから、数字が大きいことは必ずしも悪いことではありません。それが私が今言えるすべてのことです。

(質問21)：AMB-NET 1.1をローンチしたら、いくつのAtlasとApolloノードが追加されますか？

あと、アポロノードのオークションシステムもありますか？

Vlad：それは、ネットワーク上にバンドルがいくつ作成されているかに依ります。そして、バンドルの数というのは、大規模な顧客プロジェクトを私たちがいかに早く進展できるかにかかっています。

このことに関して、最も伝えておきたいことは、私たちがApolloノードの概念を探求し、議論してきたということです。私たちが最近評価したことの1つは割り当ての分量です。そして、最大上限についていくつか考えなくてはいけないことがあります。

割り当てを時間の経過とともにどのように増やすことができるかを調査しています。つまり、常にオンラインで、ネットワークに優れたパフォーマンスを提供する等、本当に良い仕事をしているアトラスのノードは、それらが保持できる最大限のバンドル分の報酬を受けることになります。

といっても、これは、ノードを取得する唯一の方法ではありません。これは、新しいノードを取ったり新しいノードを追加したりする1つのメカニズムにすぎません。既に述べたように、他の要素も同様に重要です。例えば、コミュニティをサポートしている期間、技術的な経験は何か、そして最も重要な要素の1つは、テストネット上のノードを実行したかです。テストネットでは、ノードを簡単に素早くオンボードすることができますので、あなたは実際にやってみることをおすすめします。あなた側には何もリスクが無い状態で、ネットワークの動作の確認をすることができます。そして、テストネット上のパフォーマンスを見て、我々はますます多くのノードを追加することになるでしょう。

(質問22): アポロノードを動かしている個人がいるとします。その人が運営している会社も、アポロノードを動かしたいとしたら、それは可能ですか？

Vlad: これは興味深い質問ですね。私たちの現時点でのポリシーは、同じエンティティ(組織、団体)が持てるのは、1つのアポロノードのみと決めています。しかし、もしある人が個人的にアポロノードを持っていて、さらに法人として2つ目のアポロノードを持ちたい場合、私たちはそれについて検討しなければなりません。しかし、初期段階では、それが許される可能性は低いでしょう。なぜなら、私たちはこのネットワークをなるべく分散化・非中央集権化させた状態にしたいからです。これは、消費者・クライアント企業、私たち、そしてコミュニティの3者が同じ分量のノードを持っているべきだという長期的な戦略に繋がっています。そして、この3者のバランスを保つことは、AMB-NETが、異なるステークホルダーの中で良いバランスでシェアされていることを保証するために重要だと思います。

(質問23): 実際に、企業はどうやってアポロノードを購入するんですか？ アンブロサスのチームを通して、アポロノードを買うんですか？

Vlad: これは、購入するという話ではないんです。アポロノードに関しては、デポジット(預金)の形を取っています。ニュースレターを通じて、アナウンスしたらすぐに、アプリケーションフォームが配布されます。ノードを動かしたい人は誰でも（アトラスでもアポロでも）、アプリケーションフォームを提出しなくてはいけません。それが早く出来ればできるほど、いいでしょう。なぜなら、それで私たちは情報を得ることができて、コミュニティがどのくらい求めているの早く理解することができるからです。とにかく重要なのは、アプリケーションを書いて、提出することです。そして、その様子を見て、その後にさらに新しくノードを追加することもできるでしょう。

アプリケーションがすんでから、この詳細な説明、技術的な話は進めていきたいと思っています。あなたがノードを動かせる人として選ばれた場合、私たちは「ノードを動かすことができます」

とメールでお知らせします。そしたら、その人は、一定期間の内に、スマートコントラクトにお金を振り込む必要があります。

そして、スマートコントラクトに送金したら、あなたのノードが動かせる権利はそこで保証されます。アポロノードかアトラスノードを動かすことができるのは、必要条件です。ノードを動かすのを辞めたくなったときに、デポジットは返ってきます。ネットワーク上で、あなたが間違った行為をした場合は、デポジットは返ってきません。また、私たちがなにかおかしな行為を検知した場合も、返ってきません。私たちは、なるべく多くのコミュニティメンバーがノードを動かせるようにするつもりです。そして、みなさんが満足するようなベストなモデルを作っています。

(質問24)：ローンチの時には（そしてそれ以降）どれくらいの数のMasternodesが起動されますか？

Vlad：ネットワーク上にバンドルがいくつあるのか、ノードがテストネットワーク上でどのくらいうまく動作しているかによって変わります。テストネットによって、もっと多くのシミュレーションを私たちは行う予定です。テストネットから学んだことを生かして、メインネットでいくつのマスターノードを起動できるのか、またそれはいつ行うべきなのかを調べます。そして、繰り返しになりますが、あなたがテストネット上で行ったパフォーマンスによって、メインネット上で、あなたにどのくらいの早さでチャンスが回ってくるか決まる１つの基準になります。

(質問26)：存在できるアポロノードの数には限界がありますか？

Vlad：もちろん理論上は、限界があります。しかし、私たちにとって重要なのは、確実に私たちのシステムが成長することです。今後2ヵ月間に行われる多くの研究は、すでにネットワーク上にあるノードのパフォーマンスに影響を与えずに、Apolloノードの数を増やすにはどうすればいいのかを見ていきます。技術的には、もちろん上限はありません。優先順位は、ネットワークが動作し、必要に応じて動作することを確認することです。そして、企業の顧客は、信頼性とセキュリティを求めます。ですから私たちはまずテストを重ね、確認ができたら、もちろんアポロノードの数を追加していく予定です。

私たちは「これが予想できる最大の数です」と今言うことはありません。他のプロジェクトはそう宣言することで人を惹きつけようとするかも知れませんが、私たちはそれには興味がありません。コミュニティのため、そして顧客企業のため、確実にネットワークが成長することに、もっと関心があります。

(質問27): なぜアンブロサスは、報酬をデイリーベースでくれないのですか？なぜ28日ごとなのでしょうか？

Vlad: パフォーマンスに関わるからです。もし私たちが毎日大量のマスターノードに、報酬を送るとします。それは膨大なトランザクションになります。そして、それは 報酬を送ること以外に使う容量が少なくなってしまうことを意味します。ですから、まずパフォーマンスの効率を上げるため、というのが答えです。

では、なぜ28日なのか？ それは、4週間、つまりおよそ約1ヶ月がちょうどいい期間だと思ったからです。28は、ちょうどいい数字じゃないですか。※Vladはユーモアを込めて話しています。

(質問28)：私たちの中には、「ニュースレターにサインアップした後で電子メールの返信がない」という懸念がありました。ニュースレターは正しく機能していますか？

Vlad：それは重要な点であり、私たちが確認する必要があることです。私はバグが報告されていることを認知しています。しかし、サインアップは機能していました。そして、ここ数日でたくさんの新しいサインアップを受けました。

WordPressで使用しているライブラリ自体にバグがあり、そのためこの問題が起きました。あなたがここ数日間で購読したなら、きっと購読は正しく出来ているはずです。

しかし、あなたが確信が持てない場合は、もう一度他のメールアドレスで購読してみて下さい。ノードを申請しているときになったら、申請書類にはコメント欄ができる予定なので、コメントボックスを使用して、「これは私がTGEに使った電子メールアドレスです」など書いて下されば幸いです。

より多くの情報を提供してくれればくれるほど、公平でバランスの取れたノードの選択を行うことができます。

(質問31)：企業がAMB-NETを実際に使用するにはどのくらいの時間がかかるでしょうか？それは時間がかかり、段階的な導入を必要としますか？　またはすべての製品を一気にAMB-NETに移行できますか？

エンジェル：これは、彼らが望む統合のレベルに依存します。彼らはネットワークを同期させて稼働させ、ノードと製品を稼動させることができます。私たちは、オープンソースにしているからです。したがって、企業は自社のITチームを使用して、立ち上げることができます。また、一方で、サービスとしてのブロックチェーンを使用することもできます。サービスとしては、エルメスノードをに実行し、サービスを提供し、トランザクションを記録できます。その場合、AMB-NETに移行する必要はありません。既存のソリューションに統合するだけで、残りの作業はAMB-NETによって処理されます。

つまり、別のシステムを使用することは技術的な問題だけでなく、企業の従業員を訓練しなくてはいけないという問題もあります。そのため、私たちのツールを使いやすくすること、そして使う人にとって、直感的なUIを作ることも重要です。そして、私たちがリリースした製品やサプライチェーンのためにリリースしたダッシュボードのスクリーンショットでも、これは明らかかと思います。それは使いやすく、エレガントであることを意図しています。

(質問35)：Ambrosusは今後、アトラスマスターノードの要件を10,000 AMB以下に引き下げることを検討していますか？

Vlad：引き下げる可能性は低いです。これらの数値を微調整する理由は、その数を減らす理由がないことを保証するためです。

ここで非常に興味深いのは、コミュニティのメンバーや、それらのノードを実行するメンバーを作ることだと思います。ノードを一緒に実行するために、小さなトークンホルダーを一緒にプールするオプションを検討することもできます。誰かがそれをしたいと思えば 、私達がそれをじゃますることはないでしょう。私は、このような多くのチャンスが議論されるべきであり、私たちはまだこうした可能性について検討しきれていないと思っています。コミュニティの誰かが何かアイディアを持っていれば、私たちは一緒に議論することに非常に興味があります。なので、いつでもコンタクトして下さい。具体的な案について話す事は歓迎です。

(質問37)：各チャレンジ後に報酬が与えられ、スマートコントラクトで4週間ごとに配布されるだけですか？または報酬は4週間に1回授与されますか？

Vlad：Atlasノードがチャレンジを受け入れるたびに、特定の期間にバンドルを保存することができます。すべてのバンドルは、何年もの保存期間を持ちます。たとえば、ヘルメスノードを所有している人物(企業)が、バンドルをアップロードします。そして、彼らは、選択した期間、そのバンドルを保管するために12ドルを支払います。もし彼らが5年間それを保持する場合は、そのバンドルのために$ 60ドル払うことになるでしょう。そして、このチャレンジに対してレスポンスをした人が、このバンドルを5年間保持することになります。1年に1ドル、5年では、総額は5ドルになります。

仕組みとしては、アトラスのノードは5年間で5ドルの報酬が与えられます。そして、その5ドルは28日間ごとに分割され、最大で報酬の65％分が貰えます。つまり、5年間で65％に達します。そして、アトラスノード所有者としての取引期間全体を完了した場合に限り、残りの35％が支払われます。

(質問41)：プライベートとパブリックのバンドルの比率をどのくらいにするつもりか教えてもらえますか？

Vlad：重要なことは、誰かがエルメスノードに何らかのデータを送信してAMB-NETを使用するたびに、そのエルメスノードがそのアセットまたはイベントをバンドルに保存するということです。データがプライベートであるかパブリックであるかはこの点において関係がありません。 Ambrosusのすべてのアセットとイベントはバンドルに保存され、そのバンドルはブロックチェーン上に公開されます - つまり、バンドルハッシュがブロックチェーンに置かれ、バンドル内の実際のデータはアトラスノードに保存されます。ではここで、エルメスノードに公開されたくないプライベートなデータがある場合、そのエルメスノードはそのデータをローカルに保存しますが、そのイベントまたはアセットのメタデータはとにかくバンドルに入ります。したがって、データはバンドルには含まれませんが、すべてのメタデータと登録時刻など他のものすべてはバンドルに入ります。

つまり、会社がプライベートまたはパブリックデータを作成していても、バンドルの観点からは、あるいは報酬を得るという観点からは、アトラスノードの場合においては大した違いはありません。唯一の違いは、プライベートデータの場合は、そのデータがバンドル内にないことです。なぜならバンドルの中のものはすべて公開された状態なので。バンドルに入っているすべてのデータは誰でもアクセスできます。「アクセスできる」とは、アトラスノードが外部からアクセスできるAPアドレスまたはURLを持つ必要があることを意味します。だからこそ、あなたが自分の家のものしか持っていなければ、それは機能しないでしょう。これは本当に基本的なことです。プライベートデータは単にエルメスノードに保存されます。

(質問47): 100日間1AMBを購入し保持している人物Aと、50日前に10AMBを購入し、持ち続けている人物Bがいるとします。そうしたら、どちらが優先されるでしょうか？

エンジェル：はい、私が前に述べたように、保持期間はもっと重要です。ですから、TGEから参加しているゼータは、数ヶ月間保持されていたシグマよりも優先順位が高くなります。もちろん、2人の候補者が同じ期間保持していた場合、トークンの量が決め手になるでしょう。

(質問48)：より大きなノードにアップグレードすると、ノードを確保するチャンスが増えますか？

Vlad：それは良い質問です。小さなノードに興味がある人も、ノードを同じくらいの可能性で持てるようにしたいと私たちは思っています。もちろん、長期的には、ネットワークに十分な容量を確保することが重要です。つまり、ニーズに合わせたストレージです。技術的には、より大きなノードだけ受け入れることもできますが、私たちはそうしようとは思っていません。より小さなノード、中規模ノード、および大型ノードの両方が公平な分担を持つように、私たちは均等な分布を持つことを好みます。今では同じ量のより大きなノードよりも小さなノードが必要ですが、最後のポストでも言及したように、ノードが大きくなると、比例してより高いキャップが得られるので、小さいノードよりも、比例して大きくなるというよりも、累数的に大きくなります。より多くのキャパシティを持つようになったら、さらに面白くなるでしょう。しかし、私たちは間違いなく良好なバランスを持つことに興味があります。

(質問49)：アンドロイドや他のモバイルプラットフォームで、AMBをステーキングすることは可能でしょうか？それともデスクトップだけでしかできませんか？

Vlad:モバイルウォレットを作ることにはとても興味があります。デスクトップウォレットよりも先にモバイルウォレットが出来る可能性もあります。今は、短期間で何かをリリースすることはありませんが、10月に行われる完全なパブリックローンチのときには、モバイルかデスクトップどちらか少なくとも1つは、ウォレットが出来ているでしょう。

(質問50): 中程度のテクノロジー能力しかない人が、マスターノードのセットアップをすることは可能になりますか？

Vlad: これは、確実に重要な質問ですね。

私たちは、新しいノードを追加する、またはノードを稼働する経験をなるべく簡単で、シームレスにしたいと思っています。なので、私たちはいまウェブベースのとてもシンプルな、ノードを立てるためのユーザーインターフェースを開発中です。しかし今は、コアテクノロジーにフォーカスすることが大事だと考えています。パブリックローンチの頃までには、とても簡単になっている予定です。

今は、早期アダプターたちに、テストネットで試してみてほしいと思っています。

私たちは、「はい、これがコードだよ。あとはよろしくね」みたいなやり方をするつもりはありません。その反対で、わかりやすい方法を考えています。簡単にできることを、そのくらい重要視しています。

(質問51): ハイパーレジャーソリューションと比較して、アンブロサスのソリューションは費用の点ではどう違いがありますか？

Vlad:まず、アンブロサスのソリューションを使えば、他のブロックチェーンソリューションを採用する時のように、高い費用のかかるコンサルタントを雇う必要がありません。なぜかというと、私たちのブロックチェーンソリューションは、オープンソースだからです。 ライセンス費用もかかりません。企業の視点から見ると、アンブロサスは、とても簡単でわかりやすい費用モデルを持っています。1バンドルは12米ドルです。そして、1つのバンドルは、16000のイベントとアセットから成り立ちます。こうしたモデルは、企業に対してとてもシンプルなプライスモデルを提供することができます。例えば、毎月数百万のアセットとイベントを作成したければ、数千ドル、バンドルをアップロードするための費用がかかるだけです。他にはかかりません。他の企業、そして他のプロジェクトは、ここまで分かりやすく、企業にとって計算しやすく、理解しやすい費用モデルを持っていないです。",NA,"95bdcd",NA,0,NA,"false",1536721698,"false","self","t5_3mh72","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/ambrosus/comments/95bdcd/8月1日vladとエンジェルとのama一部抜粋日本語訳/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

I’m a big fan of the Ambrosus Ecosystem since day one. A few weeke ago, I applied for a Zeta Node but my interest for AMB is getting bigger and bigger each day. As of right now, I‘m considering selling all my other coins in order to upgrade for a Sigma Node as I strongly believe in this project. However, I am wondering what the chances might be to get that Sigma Node because the application process has been going on for a while now. What do you think are the chances? I would be very happy if anyone (maybe also the AMB team) could provide me with an answer. Otherwise I‘ll stick to my Zeta Node. Thank you so much. Keep the good work going!

I'll probably hold on to most of them since I foresee prices running due to people wanting nodes if they are profitable, but I'll want to sell fairly consistently at some point.  I know prices and volume should go up if the nodes generate enough revenue but I'm afraid that the selling pressure of the node holders will also affect prices and I won't be able to sell at the price I want. Will the Ambrosus team set up a system where node owners can sell the tokens they make directly to the clients to avoid always having to deal with the exchanges (especially considering bots are always trying to undercut you). I feel like this would be a win-win for the node holders and the clients using the system and would also keep the prices more stable.

There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's amb tracked spaghetti 


Shout-out to Angel Versetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready 


To drop bundles, but he keeps on forgettin' 
The keys he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud 


He opens his ledger, but the Bitcoins won't come out 
He's chokin', how, price has pumped up, everybody's jokin' now 


The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!


Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity 
Oh, there goes AMBlet, he choked

 
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No 
He won't have it, he knows his whole projects ropes 


It don't matter, 
He knows AMB's dope, he knows that, but he's broke 


He's so stacked that he knows 
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's 


Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody 
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him.

- DHL? (Transparent Supply chain shipping custody)

- Accenture? (Pharmaceutical, insurance, etc)

- R3 collaboration?



Cause if so Angel, Bravo... This article below('coin telegraph' link) speaks to something that you guys are actively doing, and that you are actively in pilots in regards to this exact tech says something too. Trust me, there are people who see and believe. It's as if DHL (below link) tweeted a nod of approval as if to say, ""Keep up the great work Angel"". And when someone posted the article about what NDA's are, it shows the impatience of those who expect everything all at once. I live in the Seattle area, and hopefully you guys select my wife and I as potential node holders and we will patiently wait our turn. I see your teams future with the various announced partnerships as it is (UN, Swiss government, etc). And I can definetely respect that the team and you need to get any and all kinks out before any reputations are ruined from unveiling NDA's, for the sake of others wishes. And the way that 5G is now progressing, it won't be much longer until blockchain helps connect the world in a much more efficient and logical way. 

Keep up the great work, seriously, I cant wait to rock your logo around my school campus, planning on ordering some stuff soon. The wife says you guys need to outsource a company that has more form fitting things to wear around. If there's anything my wife and I could do to help promote Ambrosus on the ground level go ahead an pm me and get my contact info. I'm going into Electrical Engineering and I'm very passionate about supply chain tech like yours. I've been following you guys for awhile and love what I see you doing and where your vision is.
