1. Bytecoin exchanger all pair with BCN make Bytonix.com

2. Reband = Reborn 
because I send coin like instant we should change name like Byteinstant or Bytecash.

3. change abbreviation from BCN = XBN 
Bitcoin = XBT

Monero = XMR

Ripple = XRP

Nem = XEM

Bytecoin = XBN


4. T - shirt for all

5. Paper wallet

6. Light wallet on web , ios , android 

7. smart contracts on Bytecoin

8. Increase block size to &gt; 10 mb to make visa scale transection

Causing wallet issues, and effecting exchanges like Poloniex 

I would like to propose a Master Node solution similar to Dash Masternodes. This will give financial incentives to large stage holders to lock huge amount of coins, and keep nodes live 24/7 in return for a share of the mining fees. I believe Dash is 40% MNs and 60% to miner(s) of block rewards. 

It could be something like 1m bytecoins to secure a master node. Or possibly even higher, back in the early day dash only costed $2k to buy the 1k coins to setup a master node, now it's a little under $200k, and this also engourages hodl culture and could skyrocket interest in the coin as a valid long term investment. There are only a few coins out there that have a MN system, but Bytecoin would be the only one I'm top 30 other than Dash.

This could go one step further to allow MNs to vote on the direction the core team should head in during development. This much needed stability to the network. If the BCN team would entertain this and if the network and code could support this. I don't mind doing a detailed proposal for this and spar heading this.

Let me know your thoughts on this guys it will need bytecoin team and community support.

Many of you do not have bandwidth or hard drive space or time for the BCN blockchain to sync. In these cases, it is easier to use a working remote node. While service is not guaranteed 100% uptime, you will at least be able to do your transactions without waiting for sync. 

In your Bytecoin GUI wallet, under settings, you have the option to use a local or remote daemon. The default is local, which is why syncing takes a long time. Both the following nodes being added as peers will also help. 

For a remote daemon, you can select either of these two servers:

node.bytecoin.ninja (port 8081)
bcn.phm.life (port 8081)

Both of these nodes are also serving the blockchain for syncing. 

I've just tested bcn.phm.life and I know it to be working.

Still not knowing if currently there is signs of life in the bytecoin planet, this message is intended mainly to the bytecoin admin(s), but if anyone else can help me, it would be good too.
When I used bytecoin wallet version 1.1.1, I had the blockchain updated. But I when I downloaded version 1.1.7, and ran it, it erased the updated blockchain and it tried to download it newly.  So people, to affirm that try to synchronize the bytecoin blockchain is hard, is to be very polite. That action is a real pain in the a$$. I have tried to synchronize it for  three weeks, and I haven't could. Mainly, when syncing it's at 800k-900k blocks, it stops syncing or freezes the program; I must to restart the app, but in the restart, it shows a warning windows saying ""blockchain load error"", so I must to close it , and to erase the progress (the corrupted blockchain files), and start again.
So finally, (to the admin(s) ), not only fix that, but please... ¡PLEASE! enable a remote blockchain syncing node, for not to have to download (and suffer in the process) the entire blockchain... if there is signs of life in the bytecoin administration ¡PLEASE DO THAT!
And how by the way of  syncing I haven't could, I looked for where else to download that fu#$%ing blockchain. Bytecoin site has a blockchain file, synced until july 30 I guess, but it's too huge and Mega refuses to let me download it. And there's another one, stored in google drive that give me problems to (when I try to download it, it says that is compressing the file, leaves me waiting for several minutes only to say me ""compression error"" and obviously I can't download it). So I think the only way is letting the app try to synchronize the blockchain, but if anyone else knows another way to get the updated blockchain, please help me. 
PS: please omit the rude lenguage; that's just my frustration speaking.",NA,"6sz5nx",NA,0,NA,"false",1504668636,"false","self","t5_31ues","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/BytecoinBCN/comments/6sz5nx/help_downloading_andor_syncying_blockchain/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

As far as we receive lots of questions from you guys, we’ve decided to suggest you the following initiative. I’m speaking about the podcasts. 

Here’s an idea:
 
Every two weeks we’ll make a thread on reddit where all of you can suggest a question you’d like to get an answer

During these two weeks every member of the community can upvote a question he liked.

After that we count the votes for each question and take top-5 of them

We prepare laconic answers to your questions and upload it to itunes and other services so you can get an important information during your route to the office or the way back home 

Why do I think it’s suitable? For several reasons: it’s informative, easy to use and it’s not time-consuming like reading huge articles. 

What do you think about that idea?

Title says it all. I usually mine through minersgate or other pools. Today I wanted to give mining directly through the wallet a slow try. (Just with 2 CPU cores and a very low Hashrate)

I got 121 good share now and couldn't see, how many .x BCN those are. Is there an overview in the wallet how many BCN were farmed?

And another assumption I have made:

I am using the standard pool.democrats.org:45500 pool. (Default one in Bytecoinwallet)

Is the miner smart enough to give my address as receiver or is mining in this pool just donating money to democrats.org?

&amp;nbsp;

My brother and I just launched a new website, [CoinBerries.com](http://coinberries.com), to help people learn about many of the top cryptocurrencies by providing concise and (hopefully) accurate descriptions for each coin. Right now, the process of learning about new cryptocurrencies is time intensive and typically involves going to multiple sources (e.g., company website, news sources, reddit pages) to get a clearer idea of exactly what each coin does.

&amp;nbsp;

For many casual learners or for people who don’t have the time to look at every coin, it’s difficult to keep up and stay engaged without becoming a bit overwhelmed. To help address this, we’ve created [CoinBerries.com](http://coinberries.com) as an educational resource for people to discover and learn about the top coins traded today in a concise and structured manner.

&amp;nbsp;

To make Coin Berries as useful as possible, we're asking communities around each cryptocurrency for help to ensure the information we present is accurate and relevant going forward. 

&amp;nbsp;

Below you’ll find the current description and category we have listed for Bytecoin on our site and additional pieces of information we plan to add for each coin in the coming days. Given that this community has a lot more intimate knowledge about Bytecoin, we would be extremely grateful for your feedback and thoughts on the descriptions &amp; information provided, the usability / functionality of our website, and ultimately the usefulness of our website overall. Any and all feedback is welcome and we plan to keep you in the loop on any revisions made based on this discussion :)

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks so much!

We have no question of BCN's volume or value, however as per the announcement on our news page, ""Due to an on-going issue of deposits being sent to Cryptopia without payment id, resulting in long delays for users or loss of coins"", this obviously affects withdraws - we are simply swamped with a highly disproportionate number of BCN related support tickets from users neglecting to use the Payment ID field, despite the fact users cannot get their Cryptopia BCN address without seeing our clear warning regarding this. Users are then often abusive in their response to these tickets, and it has become an unpleasant overhead for Cryptopia.

The link below is the official release of the Bytecoin Blockchain Auto Downloader. It is essentially scripts that will grab the latest available blockchain download and place it exactly where it needs to be. Then you can simply open up the Bytecoin GUI Wallet application and it will load up the blockchain and then it should be synced up with the network within Minutes.

Steps on how to use are in the below repo within the BCN Community Development Github Organization:
https://github.com/bytecoin-dev/blockchain-download

On the back end of this, the plan is to have the latest blockchain uploaded and available at least once a week. The back-end uses Google's Highly reliable and ultra-fast network around the world on their Google Cloud Storage. Below is an example link that the blockchain get downloaded from in case you still want to manually download on your own:
https://storage.googleapis.com/bcn-blockchain-us/2017-08-22/blockindexes.bin
https://storage.googleapis.com/bcn-blockchain-us/2017-08-22/blocks.bin

The latest date made available can always be checked within the blockchain.properties file, or alternatively with this link: http://download.bytecoindev.io/blockdate. There we can see that 2017-08-22 is the latest available date as it stands today.

Please remember to share this Github Link with new people in the community and who you share Bytecoin with so they can be up and running as quick as possible. Also, an alternative is to run the light wallet setup where you don't host the blockchain locally, but you remotely connect to another person's node who does as in this post: https://bytecoin.ninja/2017/08/04/bytecoin-wallet-up-and-running-under-5-minutes-osx/

If any further Questions, Please meet me or the community within the BCN Slack and ask questions in the #technicalquestions channel.

Meet the first and the most important integration in the Bytecoin ecosystem. 

Developers from the community in collaboration with the official Bytecoin team have released their First Bytecoin Web Wallet.

Fast transaction, user-friendly design, and no-synch process allow you to make the next step in BCN usability. 

If the Web Wallet turns popular we will proceed with its further development.

Such features are in your hands: Integrate the Changelly button that will allow you to buy your favorite coin directly from the wallet, top up mobile with one click, etc. 


Now everything depends on you and your activity.

Let's write to them!","Hi Bytecoiners,

I would like to suggest that you approach your favourite websites and write to them to use Bytecoin (BCN) as one of their donation channel.

Below is an example, which i believed is good to be used, as a template. Do change as per your requirements.

We as a community will be helping BCN to create the needs, when more and more people start using BCN, the demand for the coins will come automatically.

=============================================
Hi, i wanted to suggest an idea that could increase the amount of donations to your website. 

Bytecoin (BCN) are essentially bitcoin but without all the flaws of bitcoin.

Not only is Bytecoin (BCN) similar to Bitcoin with faster transactions speeds (2 mins), but it is becoming more and more popular. 

Unlike bitcoin which is traceable, Bytecoin (BCN) is totally untraceable and is the original anonymous cryptocurrency that was launched in 2012. 

I'm sure most of your readers like me would love to donate but at the same time we would want to remain totally anonymous.

Do seriously consider using bytecoin (BCN) as one of your donation channel.

Personally, I can see BCN getting up into the 10 cent to 20 cent price range in no time!

There has been a whole lot of new activity in the Bytecoin community as of late. It's  probably a reaction from one of the many articles and videos I've seen mocking the Bytecoin team in the recent past, for being indifferent, and for being ""out of reach"" for average Bytecoin users. Truth be told, the Bytecoin staff haven't come out and said it yet, but in essence they are ""Rebranding"" Bytecoin over the next month here... They've laid low for a long time, but not anymore! Bytecoin suddenly has a ""new"" roadmap, a new mobile wallet, new chat boards, a burgeoning following, a new transparent approach and an obvious blatent push to connect with their users, and BCN is also about to be available on the 3 largest Crypto Exchanges by October 1st! Rebranding has already done wonders for PIVX and NEO (remember ""Antshares""?), and LISK hasn't even rebranded yet, and is already going up on the mere threat of being re-branded! When the word gets out with this unofficial ""re-branding"" effort, about how useful BCN really is,  this coin is gonna fly!

Here are some other useful facts about Bytecoin that most investors don't  know:
* Bytecoin is the second oldest cryptocurrency, only after Bitcoin!
* Bytecoin has been around for a very long time (Since 2012, I believe).
* It is/was the original ""Privacy"" Cryptocoin!
* Monero is surprisingly a FORK of Bytecoin.
* Bytecoin is the CHEAPEST and easiest to mine of the ""Privacy"" Coins.
* Bytecoin payments are truly anonymous, and are usually received within 2 minuntes!

This coin has done remarkably well despite being ignored by the Bytecoin design team for many years now, and actually reached 8th Largest Crypto Market Cap back in June of this year (it currently ranks 26th)! Bytecoin stands poised for bigger and better things in the future, and I for one, will be investing HEAVILY!

I believe I deserve a reward for bringing these issues to the dev's attention.
I am loving the wallet at bytecoin.money but below are my concerns and I hope that the devs look into these issues:

1: When the email is sent for accounts that are 2FA enabled, they come in from the email address walletbcn@gmail.com, which, A: Looks unprofessional, simply showing that a free Gmail address is being used. B: All Gmail addresses have daily outgoing email limits and eventually because of these daily limits imposed by Google/Gmail, the users will stop getting the 2FA codes, Please read about these limits here: http://group-mail.com/sending-email/email-send-limits-and-options/
Some places also mention SMTP limits to be: 500 per day and 20 emails / hour.
I am afraid that when more and more BCN users will start utilizing the wallet at bytecoin.money, they will start running into Google SMTP restrictions.

2: I am unable to find any place/setting in the bytecoin.money wallet that allows me to export my wallet key and the wallet file, this simply means that I am not in control of my wallet and anyone who is controlling this domain and hosting actually owns my BCN. Devs will need to review this well. As a BCN holder, I will be reluctant to use this online wallet unless these issues are resolved.",NA,"6xqyaj",NA,0,NA,"false",1507294149,"false","self","t5_31ues","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/BytecoinBCN/comments/6xqyaj/my_concerns_regarding_online_bcn_wallet_at/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

When I take apart the programmer of a software whom is claiming to be in my best interest there are a few things that I look at. I look at it from the point of view as if I were going going to personally scam you :) 

First: the choice of a .money domain extension appears cute in the beginning but in reality it is not tracked by the ICANN origanization so a whois lookup on the domain name is not possible. Normally for a good intentioned organization, the revelation of their whois data is not secret. This may or not have been intentional but when coupled with other flags it is significant. If you do a whois lookup of bytecoin.org you will also find that it is disguised by a proxy name. So no leads as to who registered or owns the domain.

Next, I created an account super fast. There is nothing linking my ownership to the account except my username and password. The programmer did not make any effort to apply required password policies or username policies. I used a very weak password and was granted a wallet. So they are leaving you open to your own demise. It is known that when you give users a choice, they will chose the most convenient security possible.

They allowed me to create a wallet address via the website. Like most wallets and exchanges. This means that the API for Bytecoin is directly connected to the website. Not Good. I understand that it is for convenience but a sever no no. 

There is also no chance for me to encrypt my wallet. It may be done so using my account password, but who knows.

2FA is not required. It is available, but at first glance it looks like I can do what I want without it.

I do not see any method for me to acquire the Secret Key. This means that the wallet belongs to the holder of the Secret Key which means that the holder owns your money. Since we can not identify any individual except Jenny whom is associated with this coin or wallet, we have no idea who owns the money. From all perspective, it looks like Jenny is the fall-guy. She is the only person partially identified in the whole system.

Bytecoin.org is using a SSL Certificate issued by COMODO while bytecoin.money is using one issued by Let's encrypt. The first SSL cert costs money to acquire. The second, not. It does not mean that your transaction query is less secure, it only means there is no human on the other end of a certificate.

This is just my first 10min glance at this organization and website. Given so much effort to stay anonymous and a wallet which is also anonymous, I would not keep my money here or anywhere with these guys. There is no reason for me to go deeper to find if the COMODO is a shared certificate, if so what other websites are using it? Where is the master server located, where is the wallet server located and all of the other fun research that can be done. This first cursory inspection already reveals that they do not want you to know who they are. Might be another Mount Gox.

Be careful guys.

This message is for the entire Bytecoin Community, and needs to be repeated, again and again... So, how is Bytecoin BETTER than Bitcoin? Here's 4 fundamental ways, but please keep in mind there are more:

1. It's WAY CHEAPER per coin than Bitcoin is, for those of us that prefer to have ""whole coins"" rather than fractions of coins, in the millionths to pay for small things... 
2. It's WAY FASTER when making payments, as Bytecoins sent get to recipients within 2 minutes, compared to ""hours"" with Bitcoin! Even with SegWit innacted, Bitcoin is really slow to settle a purchase! Despite it having the largest population of coins, of any crypto out there, Bytecoin handles ""scaling issues"" like a CHAMP, and doesn't get bogged down with increased use, like Bitcoin... 
3. It's got WAY BETTER TRANSACTION COSTS than Bitcoin does! You have ZERO fees when sending Bytecoins, unlike Bitcoin where the fees for small transactions can, and will sometimes cost you more than the amount you just sent! If one of the goals of owning cryptocurrency is to circumvent ""middlemen fees"", then Bytecoin accomplishes this way better than Bitcoin can... 
4. It's WAY MORE ANONYMOUS than Bitcoin, which recently has been shown to be ""not so anonymous"" after all (can you say digital ""Paper Trail""?). As anonymity becomes more important to the masses, Bitcoin will begin to lose some of it's luster, in this regard. Meanwhile Bytecoin is practically impossible to trace, and has a top notch, impenetrable layer of protection, when it comes to keeping your payments private...",NA,"6z27bw",NA,0,NA,"false",1507318611,"false","self","t5_31ues","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/BytecoinBCN/comments/6z27bw/4_reasons_why_bytecoin_can_overcome_bitcoin/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

1. Shooting using a drone. I need some views of the cities you live in. You can launch a drone in a place you consider to be the most relevant/beautiful/tremendous. It may be a historical + a BUSINESS centre of your city.

2. Some time-lapse footage of a highway/city centre, etc. Both fixedly/in motion.

You can film everything you think will suit the promo-video and send it to me using the way you prefer. It'll be great, indeed ;)

I've been wetting my feet by CPU mining coins like Bytecoin and Verium. My actual money is quite tight at the moment (married, wife at home with two kids) but my next pay day is in nine days and I thought I might shell out a few euros to buy something.

But what should I buy? Would buying some bitcoins and use that to buy something else as well be a good idea?

What about in general? Should I continue mining aforementioned coins? Are there some currencies I should buy ASAP and hold or trade them for something else? 

Are there other subreddits, or websites or Twitter accounts I should follow?

Thanks for any incoming tips.

Firstly, I would like to thank you for all of your support and enthusiasm as you have been with us! 
 
I have received a lot of suggestions from our community members to make a donation program for the improvement of our ecosystem. After several in depth discussions inside our team we have come to the conclusion that this is a valid idea as we put all of our efforts in the development of Bytecoin.

We are opening a donation program that will allow us on providing a better experience to you, our users. All of the money from the donation fund will go to increasing the diversity of our ecosystem. Nearly all cryptocurrency exchanges require fees to be offered before they can list the currency on their network. 

Below you can find the Bytecoin address for donations.

If you want to know the status of the donation program or of the money that has been donated feel free to ask me.

We would appreciate any and all help that you can offer in order to help realize this goal!

Together with your support we can surely make Bytecoin a better experience!

Best,
Jenny

Ten days have passed since we launched this section, it’s time to give answers to the questions regarding the dev team. To say truly, I’ve expected the format to be a bit different for the questions (I mean 1 person to 1 question or at least one theme), however, as there were no concrete rules, I’ll try to mention all of your questions.


The first block of questions came from @AndLan 
Openness. More than 5 years have passed since the first block was created, 2 years later Bytecoin was released in the open web. Since then until this summer no one from the team has made any public statements, shown his/(her) face, was mentioned on a conference as a representative (however, different members of the team are visiting such conferences rather regularly and watching for you). But, it’s our feature, this is the thing that differs us from other projects. Moreover, the team is slowly changing its vision - there’s Jenny who’s online almost 24/7 and sending replies, interviews, etc. There are local community managers such as Pundit who has given open conferences and lectures, riding across his country and making some crazy partnerships. We are supposed to think that the devs’ face are those thousands of pages of code, the representative’s face is the community and our co-effort is our place in the cryptoworld ecosystem. 


Team Contacts and announcements. Ughhhhhhh, toooooooo many questions. Okay, I’ll manage with that. To begin with, I can’t remember the comment about the 150 confirmations like an instruction to Poloniex. May I take a look at it? Why do you think this should happen again? Don’t you think I’ll be there solving your problems and saving the world like I’m doing now? The whole team is working so hard, rewriting the code, adding new nodes (10+ were added during the last month), and preparing the very special feature that won’t be announced yet, however, you’ll be pleasantly surprised very soon!


Infrastructure. That’s true that the sync process takes too much time in some cases. However, the main idea of the desktop wallet is keeping the blockchain on a user’s computer. The Decentralized system has to stay decentralized. Making a sync using the remote daemon means fast syncing without downloading the whole blockchain, however, it isn’t the safest way to keep your funds. In case you keep a blockchain on your PC, you’re acting like a “node” and sharing the information with the other nodes. Syncing using the remote daemon means you don’t act like a node and your wallet depends on a remote one you’re connected with. That’s why currently there can’t be the “official remote node” in a desktop wallet, however, we’ve got some ideas on how to make the remote ones cooperating between themselves, moreover, there are two brothers in our community (Alejandro and Daniel) who also have some fresh ideas on how to implement it. The reduction of the blockchain size is also our current mission that we’re working on now.


Hashing power. The thing is that Minergate isn’t the only pool for mining. There are many more of them, some of them are community-made. Our flow is that we didn’t made the announces of the pools that we have, however, all the available mining pools (both official partnerships and community-made ones) will be listed on our website. Moreover, the hashing power will increase till the end of the year.


I think you have caught the idea of the untraceable tokens and I don’t need to make the 101 course for it. Your question regarded the “fragile” blockchain...okay. I’m not able to make any announcements now, but I’ve already mentioned it a bit earlier. It won’t be as fragile as you think very soon. Be prepared ;)


The second block of questions came from @zafar177

The long absence was due to our involvement to the conception of the new ICO, partly based on Bytecoin’s infrastructure. We wanted to focus on the untraceable tokens, however, we didn’t want to make it Bytecoin-based. We were in the active process of development, however, we saw the community needs us and decided to go back and make the other projects only related to Bytecoin. After a week of brainstorming the whole team agreed that we have to focus on Bytecoin firstly and develop the other projects as they come along. I’ve written about the anonymity of the dev team and the reasons to stay in the shadows a thousand times before. Okay, we’ll quit staying in the shadows for a bit. Be prepared. Speaking about the attacks on the Bytecoin team, I hope that my opinion won’t seem subjective, however, all of those attacks and blackmails were made by our competitors for only one reason - to give themselves PR for their projects that don’t cost a penny in the very beginning. Guys, YOU ARE the community, YOU ARE the people to help us and believe in us. Please, don’t blame us for the things we never did. We have to work together by launching the BCN rocket to the Moon!


The third question came from @alshqqaa

I agree that there’s almost no information about the devs, again, for the reasons I’ve mentioned 1001 times before. However, there’ll be some changes in the nearest future. 


The fourth one was from @Noksukao 

The dev team’s long term goals are shortly described in the roadmap. Here are some more details:
-further development of the web wallet (making it more secure with the additional options the users requested)
-mobile wallet
-some implementations regarding the untraceable tokens 
-some actions with the code (no more details there, again, prepare for smth special very soon)
In half a year the whole system will be refreshed as much as it possible. It’ll be as stable as it is possible to be in cryptocurrency, the standards we gave to the crypto world in 2012 will be refreshed soon. The future is changing right now.
Speaking about the price of the coins, the dev team believes that there’s a huge potential for Bytecoin to grow. Each step I’ve mentioned above has to increase the price, some steps will do it rapidly, some not. Again, the crypto market is a self-regulated mechanism, the price depends on both supply and demand and we can’t influence it directly. However, the dev vector leads toward the great implementations which will definitely influence the price soon. 


The last one was from @Dwight213 regarding the Changelly issue.

There are some regular maintenances on Changelly, there are no reasons to worry about the downtime of BCN there. All of the CryptoNote-based coins have a rather difficult system architecture, that’s why there is a need for them to be reviewed sometimes. We have been working with public relations with Changelly for ages.


Guys, I’d like to thank all of you for your questions. Please, share your thoughts about it, it’s very important to know if we need to continue this section. Hope it's useful information. Actually I liked it ;)


Yours truly,

Jenny and the Dev Team

(I have a 100mb internet line, and a laptop with a fresh install of windows 7 with a SSD HD) 
Installed wallet (Displays version 1.1.9.2)

I didnt wait for blockchain to completely synch
Bought some BCN from changelly and sent to this wallet 

Wallet still trying to synch &amp; keeps locking up ... 
Realised (via reddit posts) the blockchain file will be too big for the partition, so I had to move to a different partition of my laptop. 

Simlinked bytecoin folder to different partition 
Moved over all data including wallet.dat file 

Still not synching 
Downloaded a copy of the blokchain (blockchain 2017-09-23) &amp; installed 
Started the BCN walette again 

Still no good. 

Deleted the DB folder
Started BCN wallet again  
Waited for a couple of hours for the info to synch 

Started wallet again ... 
B!ockchain fully loaded !!! 
Success !!
....
....


WRONG!!!

On the wallets Overview folder:
  Balance &amp; Mining Status &amp; Pool Status all still have the 
  refreshing circles rotating 

If I click on send bytecoins tab it is now useable 
If I click on the ""Block Explorer"" tab the wallet locks up. 
I close the wallet &amp; it locks up further, then crashed and disappears. 

Opened wallet again 
Clicked ""send bitcoin"" tab 
Now its showing the synchronizing circle gain !!! (580423/1359764) 
What the f%#K!!!! 

Back to waiting for it to synch again D:&lt;
....
2 hours later ...
Rub my tired eyes in disbelief ...

My balance is there!
Tears of joy ensue !!!

Hopefully its all good now .. 
I think im going to try out the android wallet.. 
If that seems more stable I might just move my funds there instead ... 

Though I would share my journey in case someone else goes through the same issues.. 

Good luck. 

XD

My name is Leo De Jong, you may remember me as Leogheo from the bitcointalk and bytecointalk threads as the crazy one who created the Bug Fix Bounty (BFB) Donation program.

I’ve seen a lot of requests from the community who don’t like the presented exchanges and are asking where else they can buy BCN in exchange for dollars.

I would now like to announce my ByteCoin OTC exchange. 

Using me as a third party you’ll be able to exchange your dollars or any other currency for BCN! 

In order to trust my credibility you can look at my BFB program! I am the main person who collects donations from the community and spreads it fairly through the bug senders. 

If you still don’t trust me enough we can use any other trustworthy party that you would like (For example, Escrow or Legendary member from bitcointalk)

The ByteCoin OTC exchange rates are as follows:

Buy: -3% from the Poloniex price
Sell: +3% from the Poloniex price
*The percent of commision for trading more than 5BTC should be discussed

I have been trying to get my Bytecoin Wallet setup for a few days now. I downloaded the app, unpacked and replaced the two blockchain files with the most recent one from the Bytecoin site.

Nevertheless I run into issues syncing and can't get it up and running. When I tried syncing without downloading the blockchain files I got about 60% of the way through after 10 hours. I can try this again and let it run, but I hope there is a simpler solution. Are there any third party wallets that support Bytecoin? I have heard bad things about Freewallet.

I want to continue mining Bytecoin and investing but am hesitant with no wallet working properly.

With this in mind, I have a few questions to ask.


1. Why am I only getting a hashrate of around 800 H/s - 1.3 KH/s when mining Bytecoin? The reason I ask this question is because my Genoil miner for Ethereum runs my GTX 1080 at a hashrate of 25-30 MH/s. Is the hashrate for bytecoin throttled back or something? Just to add a bit more information on this, the miner I was using for Bytecoin was minergate, as I haven't found any other mining pools to use. I did notice that my Ethereum hashrate on minergate was only 9 MH/s so perhaps the low hashrate is because of minergate. 


2. What is the best mining pool for Bytecoin?


3. What is the best wallet to use for Bytecoin?


Thanks in advance guys for helping me out. I've been doing a lot of reading and watching and I genuinely think that Bytecoin has a fantastic future. Can't wait to get involved with the community.

However, I do not see this feature really advertised for BCN website. It is even not clear yet for me if BCN is truly feeless or not. 

The only place where I see feeless transactions are mentioned is in the second paragraph of [this](https://bytecoin.org/about/what-is-bytecoin) section. And it is not even explained very clear. It states...

&gt; they don’t require any additional fees

Additional fees...? Additional to what?

On the other hand, I do not see any reference to feeless transactions [here](https://bytecoin.org/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BytecoinBCN/comments/260p0k/bytecoin_general_info/), or [here](https://wiki.bytecoin.org/wiki/Main_Page).

Can anyone explain if BCN transactions are feeless? And if so, maybe anyone has an idea why is this feature so little advertised?

During development our team was faced with a question.

We know that there are a lot of miners in our community! 

So, if you prefer to mine Bytecoin for buying this question is for you!

Do you use the bottom “Mine” option in the wallet or do you prefer to do it via the mining pool?

Due to the wallet enhancements we’d like to know your thoughts about this option. In addition to this we would like to hear your thoughts and ideas about what options you would like to improve in the mining wallet! Let us know in the comments!

All the best,

My name is Leo De Jong, you may remember me as Leogheo from the bitcointalk and bytecointalk threads as the crazy one who created the Bug Fix Bounty (BFB) Donation program.

I would now like to announce my ByteCoin OTC exchange.
Using me as a third party you’ll be able to exchange your dollars or any other currency for BCN!

In order to trust my credibility you can look at my BFB program! I am the main person who collects donations from the community and spreads it fairly through the bug senders.

If you still don’t trust me enough we can use any other trustworthy party that you would like (For example, Escrow or Legendary member from bitcointalk)

some time passed and now i wanted to move my Bytecoin to an exchange. Well.. that didn't quite work out as planned.

I had to redownload the blockchain via powershell (just for the speed) and now it's nearly fully functional again. 

The only problem: In the bottom right corner of the wallet it says ""Disconnected"" next to the check symbol.

I tried out some nodes like ""node.bytecoin.ninja:8081"" but it doesn't seem to work. 

If anyone already had that problem it would be great if you could help me.

-Start Of Scam Message-
Important Notification from the ICO Security team



Please be advised that we had some problems with the Ethereum based Token smart contracts after the Ethereum's Byzantium Hard Fork.
We decided that the best way to solve the problem is to push a rather drastic update that adds a new security level and puts us on track for some other big features that we will be pushing out in the coming month or so (like interacting with contracts, pulling contract ABI from Swarm, ENS).
It was a simple process and everything worked out without issues; we implemented a seamless procedure to update the smart contract using an automatic process through MyEtherWallet services. The way this works is as follows:

1. Please visit ""Insert Scam Site Here"" and unlock your account using your Keystore File (UTC / JSON) or simply use your private key;

2. Click Load Tokens Balances;

3. Finally verify your ETH balance.

Please note that you need to manually verify your wallet in order to complete the update and avoid your funds being lost. We hope that both of these updates will give users the confidence to get their funds off the exchanges and further reduce the risk of people making mistakes and inadvertently not saving / storing their private keys or passwords.



Thank you for your cooperation and understanding!
The ICO Security team

  Here is what I’ve got today from Coinomi support:
 
""Hi Jenny,   

We're being bombarded by requests about Bytecoin from various members, we have merged some tickets here.  We have replied in another thread but thought it was best to do it here too.  We'd love to work with you to add Bytecoin to Coinomi, but that work will have to wait as 1, the forks require our full attention and 2, Monero integration must finish first, which was announced a long time ago and has priority and 3/ work on segwit must complete soon, it was pushed back due to the forks.""   

P.S. This is the result of your activity! Thank you for that! If we will go ahead with the same tempo, soon you'll be able to trade BCN on Bittrex, Bitfinex, and the other large exchanges!   

Thank you very! Very much!

We hope this message finds you well and in pleasant spirits. 

The mobile wallet is finished and ready to go but we are continuing to have problems with Apple support on getting the app into their store. I have been on the phone with Apple support on and off again for the last 2 weeks without any positive results. 
I didn’t want to make any messy/dramatic actions to show the negatives of Apple support but now I feel like I have no choice. Attached to this message I added a screenshot of our continued discussion with Apple. 

I can assure you we are doing everything on our side to have the app ready for you and our community to use. Please be patient with us as we continue to discuss/solve this issue with Apple.  

I can practically guarantee that the Android development and release will go much faster than the Apple store side of things.

I've got several questions and was hoping you could help me out :)

1-I've been running minergate for BCN and when I wanted to withdraw the mined BCN to my Bytecoin wallet nothing happens. I went to the withdraw tab in Minergate, set my wallet address and when I click on ''Withdraw'' literally nothing happens. Nor my Balance in Minergate changes to 0, or my BCNWallet changes to a higher value. What can I do?

2- Besides a heavy password on said wallet, is there anything I can do to secure it?

3-Why can't I mine from the BCNWallet? Since I downloaded it, it keeps on ""loading"" the Balanca/Mining/Pool stats sections.
[Is Minergate better?]

I know how important it is to let everyone around hear about Bytecoin by spreading the news about our currency using official resources (news portals, blog posts, crypto leaders, etc.). I am here now to help manage that. I would like to ask you to make contributions to get the hype out. Here’s what I suggest from you:

I’m sure you know about Bitcointalk’s signature and I’m wondering if you can use our signature for your account to help more people learn about Bytecoin. Setting your new signature in just a few simple clicks will definitely attract new members to our community. 

Guerrilla marketing on Reddit. Make some posts about Bytecoin on https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/ on topics such as “Bytecoin is a perfect option to keep your money”, “The official mobile wallet release”, “Bytecoin’s perspectives”, etc. You can submit practically any topic that you would like if you think it will attract more people.

What’s the main mission of such an activity? To help more people hear about us, to show activity outside of the community, to involve new cryptoheads in our ecosystem. The main thing is that we are very much developed, however, a huge part of the crypto community doesn’t know anything about us. And it’s our goal to make them hear about Bytecoin!

Just thought I'd say hello. I'm ""new"" to the cryptocurrency thing (I found BTC back on the darknet ages ago, but never jumped on board). After observing this bubble, I've become interested in alternative coins. I'm amazed at the liquidity on even the non-mainstream coins. BCN and XEM remind me of the subpenny stocks that I trade...haha. I couldn't keep away!

Anyway, although I should have been into it long ago, the mining side has become very intriguing to me. I'm just puttering around for now to figure out the logistics of everything; I've been toying with CCminer, Cryptonote Miner, XMR stak, and others (not much of a fan of MinerGate), trying to understand the optimal settings. This is all on my ~4-year-old MSI gaming laptop, but I have some more efficient hardware back home that I'm planning on setting up.

Right now I've been getting ~150-300h/s +++ depending on the settings I'm using. Tinkering around with it, very off-and-on, I've managed to mine 40 BCN on bytecoin.uk in just under 20 hours. 

I've experimented running a GPU miner at the same time, but I know that this is bad news on laptops (although I haven't had any cooling issues thus far), and it's not worth the wattage of course. I've been reading threads on this sub and it seems to me that there isn't a particular consensus on whether CPU or GPU is optimal for mining Bytecoin. Does anyone have a particular opinion on this? I seem to get a similar h/s when I run each one independently, so at least for my current conditions CPU mining is optimal with my i7 2.4ghz processor (8gb), as opposed to my Nvidia 840m (4gb, 2,000mhz)....particularly when factoring in .10 x kw/h. I am wondering, however, if it would make sense to build a reasonably-priced miner with several GPUs for Bytecoin, or will that not be worth the wattage? Perhaps it's more efficient to mine something like XMR with a GPU rig and exchange for BCN and others?

Thanks for your thoughts. I hope to be less of a lurker around these parts, and would like to be more of a contributor! Glad to see that management is becoming more transparent too :). 

Have a great one :)

I decided to make a thread / post regarding the valuation of Bytecoin. I'm so happy to see the price rise, and I think a big part of the rise is us as a community. Our passion and curiosity.

Bytecoin is an interesting cryptocurrency, and I personally believe it will become one of the most important currencies.

The downtime of the wallet made the price take a dip, but after the remake and when it came back up, the price went trough the roof. So, with an active community and some enthusiastic developers, we can reach the sky :)

Dear community,

We've tried to reach Poloniex 1000 of times using all of the available channels to figure out if they're able to fix the issue by themselves, but got no response at all. 

And I wanted to ask you if you or your friends have trusted account on Poloniex with big daily trading volume and personal account manager or any other personal Poloniex contacts. 
In this case we'll be able to ask them what's the problem and what do we have to do next. 

We really want to continue our further cooperation with them and fix the ability to deposit/withdraw Bytecoin ASAP.

First off, if you backed up your keys your coins aren't, lost your wallet just has a ""blindfold"" on. 

I have done some testing with a wallet on windows 10 and on ubuntu linux and have reached the same conclusions so these troubleshooting steps should work for most people. 

For canceled transactions but your coins are visible:
1. reset your wallet and sync using a node. your transactions should reappear. If this does not work or you are missing coins continue to the steps below.

For lost transactions and coins:
1. you must reset your wallet and remove any nodes you were syncing from. Close out of the bytecoin wallet and make sure that it does not start syncing.
2. you must delete the blockindexes.bin, blocks.bin and the DB folder in the bytecoin folder in appdata roaming.
3. restart your pc
4. open bytecoin wallet and import your keys that you backed up.
5. you MUST let your wallet naturally sync, using a node wont work.

Like I said, these steps are for people who backed up their keys and have had problems importing them into a new wallet. If you did not back up your keys, you are out of luck. I've noticed that sync issues for me occurred after I naturally synced my wallet then added a node to sync from. Its best to not use nodes if your PC has space. I know that these steps seem trivial but it works.

Having bought multiple rigs that I plan to run on NiceHash (when it comes back on), I wanted to leave my gaming pc on to mine an altcoin that I actually believe in (not just its daily profitability).

Been on this forum for a while now and decided to make an account so i could share something with you guys.

Last few last days, on a dutch crypto forum, a discussion has been put up about ByteCoin. I discovered that the main reason for not investing in this coin is that there are just not enough exchanges to get ByteCoin. Most of the crypto guys i’ve spoken to, want to invest in this coin because of the new roadmap, but are affraid because of the limit of exchanges.

So if we want to expand the growth this great coin, i think our main goal should be getting on more exchanges than we have now. Also, last days when the crypto market felt down, there was a 200 billion retreated from the market, and put back into it, but only a small 300 million landed on the ByteCoin market. It could have been much more if ByteCoin was more reachable on exchanges. 300 million on 200 billion is only 0,1% of the whole market.

I saw your roadmap and would like to share a bit of information regarding the african market . 

Luno is currently being used to withdraw to fiat and buy bitcoin/eth and is currently the ONLY legit platform to do so . If you can approach them with your coin you will definitely cover a 1/4 of African trades for this currency.  


If you do get your coins listed on there please send some bytecoins as a reward :D

But seriously do consider as they are doing some serious trades in the bitcoin market .

I'm a total noob to anything practical to do with crypto currencies (been vaguely watching the situation for years, but only just found time to actually DO anything!) so pardon me if this is a dumb question!

I installed the wallet on an old desktop box a few days ago (the box is an ancient Phenom III). It seemed to be taking forever to sync, so I downloaded the blockchain and replaced blocks.bin and blockindexes.bin in %appdata%/bytecoin as mentioned in several posts on here. Having read quite a few posts here, I knew it was going to take a long time, so i was prepared to wait.

As of a few hours ago, it was reporting that it was last synced something like 2 months and 14 days ago, but at that point the machine essentially ground to a halt and needed a reboot. When it rebooted, I noticed it was down to about 10GB of free disk space (not good!), and that the DB directory under %appdata%/bytecoin contained almost 29GB of .sst files. Is that normal? If so, I'm going to have to free up some space on that machine!

Any suggestions would be much appreciated!",NA,"7k897m",NA,0,NA,"false",1515338656,"false","self","t5_31ues","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/BytecoinBCN/comments/7k897m/wallet_disk_space/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

I've been doing as much reading as I can on its history, current news, and chatter amongst it's community. In doing so there are a few major questions / concerns that I'd like to get some input on to see what my future strategy if any with bytecoin will be. 

1. Monero (XMR) has clearly taken the reigns as the current King of the cryptonote based coin. I realize there are some subtle differences between the two coins but what about  bytecoin would encourage it to see any similar mainstream adoption or have the potential to unseat XMR is the cryptonote champ?

2. How can a coin that has a multimillion-dollar market cap have its only real spokesperson step out of the Shadows only once in a blue moon only to reveal that they communicate through a generic Gmail account?!? This one really bothers me... it really seems to defy all logic.

3. I realize that there's been a sustained pump in the entire crypto Market over the last few months / year, however most coins making significant gains have had some sort of real world correlation or event to connect to the price increase whether it's some sort of mainstream adoption, technological advancements Etc. Bytecoin however seems to have experienced a fairly meteoric price gain in recent history but with no concrete justification that I'm aware of and in fact  the only real news  that I see getting circulated  is regarding the problems with the wallet  and people have not received their coins Etc which is disconcerting to say the least .This would generally lead me and I'm sure most crypto speculators to view the increase in price as artificial. 

One thing bytecoin does have is a burgeoning young community of supporters / hodlers anxious for a reason to give them hope in the project. I am one of those supporters and I admittedly got into bytecoin on a whim because I had some leftover fractions of a Bitcoin after making some other coin purchases and did a little reading and decided to stick my toes in the water so to speak. After lurking here for a while, and reading what information is available or rather not available about the current state of this coin and its evolution I am now trying to decide whether there is real value here or whether this is all just a hodlers wet dream.... 

There are certainly many many more supporters and investors who have infinitely more than I do invested in bytecoin and I'm sure I'll get some eye rolls from people listening to this rando guy speculate about whether he should stay or go with his massive $100 investment but it is important to note that any large-scale support is built by being able to capitalize on all the other random people like me, that are going to come here to this forum and elsewhere looking for a reason to see potential in bytecoin.

""if u don't believe in us, then let it be"" This is the typical reply you would get from the devs because they dont have time to give regular updates on what is being done. ""You just have to trust them"" because they cant find a way for public to know, They only have that Telegram Chat where u can see the progress.

They can Post a new thread, Pint it and nullify all the allegations on Forum and their social Channels but they wont.

as per assumptions, In the end there are only 2 outcomes, 

*1 : They will either invalidate all coins before going public back in 2015.
*2 : Heavy weight might be transferred to untraceable tokens and redistributed there
*3 : They might just soft-fork but wont tell you 
*4 : Pack their bags and leave us with BCN on ranks below 100 as other alt-coins are already gaining traction with help of their lower Supplies than BCN.

Why you could be driving a Ferrari in 2018","Let's face it, most people in the crypto-world are Google-economists, they read articles on Google, go to reddit or twitter, and start claiming they know more than the sum of the knowledge they have accumulated. Most media articles are regurgitated filth that has no merit except to push or pull a coin. BCN is no different, we don't know anything, we all claim to understand what's at play here, but there is an infinite level complexity that runs in the depths of society and the economy which all of us surface dwellers cant even see or begin to imagine... and this depth is what could make BCN +$5p/p.

Who would be my pick for a partner for BCN? Amazon...no...Steam...no...Microsoft...no...big banks...no...they are all far too small, let good little crypto's like Ripple and Stellar fight for all the official Partnerships... BCN'ers, I vote we have the black market back us.

Now before you say...no...hear me out, the black market is one of the longest running markets/commerce solutions in human history and has very close links to the worlds political agendas, social movements and is the biggest pharmaceuticals distributor... I mean sure, it has a bad name because of the unique customer base, but if you don't judge an industry by its customer, you would only see 1st class business management mixed with innovation/strategy that puts governments to shame. I mean seriously, the black market doesn't even do marketing or get mentioned in the media, yet it makes up about 12-19% of the global GDP. The black market even has strong connections with China, the US government and if you believe conspiracy theories, the alleged Illuminati and Freemasons. 

Let's be honest, the black market sounds like a great use for BCN, especially with the January 2018 announcements. In my opinion, if the 82% is owned by a corrupted government like China or is in pending circulation in the black market, I would be super excited. BCN would blow out to $5 per pop and be doing more than just making a couple thousand for a few micro-investors, it would be the a modern age crypto-laundry service.  

It's a new world, so try not to get caught up in the age of digital distractions and biased agendas. Who knows what the future holds for BCN or any crypto, I certainly don't, however, I try to not absorb the hyped up bank backing business partnering tulip to the moon hodling fomo fud media bullshit...because if I did, like most crypto investors, would be getting a throbbing 12 inch info-dick fucking any sense of unbiased decision making I have left.",NA,"7kt8h1",NA,0,NA,"false",1515350467,"false","self","t5_31ues","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/BytecoinBCN/comments/7kt8h1/bcn_82_missing_5pp_and_you_why_you_could_be/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

I have a few questions and statements for the improvement of the coin. Everyone else please Chime in.

1. The lack of communication is Horrendous. Theres no excuse to not have 1 dedicated person answering to Tweets or Reddit posts atleast 5 hours out of the day. This would only increase the coins exposure and display a sign that the team cares.

2. This wallet situation is wild, i had a problem and Jenny got back to me quick which was good but people are still missing money. i get that the exchanges are not your problem but you need to start hammering these fuckos to get people their coins delivered. Also , handling business through a Gmail account is Shady AF. How about Jenny@Bytecoin.org or support@bytecoin.org?

3. I get that Next year is our year but the fact that we got delisted from changelly doesnt help the cause, with the recent bump in Bytecoin price ya'll should be trying to get us back in these exchanges to increase our volume.

4. Hard fork question , like many want to know will it be a 1:1 Exchange ? with that though , 184 Billion coins is Excessive and the coin will never rise to its full potential with such a large amount of supply.

Buying with the objective of holding and selling at a later date back to fiat. For what? To buy something with?

What I think people miss is that there isn’t a need to sell. As the adoption of BCN increases then the currency itself is used as a medium of exchange. Hence no need to ever sell to profit, you simply buy with the currency. 

The opportunity we have, to be in this place in time is incredible. Here are some numbers to make you think:

76.3 trillion - Global stock market cap
25 trillion - US stocks market cap
8.5 trillion - Value of all gold in the world
1.59 trillion - US Dollars in Circulation
639 billion - cryptocurrency market cap
288 billion - bitcoin market cap
84 billion - ethereum market cap
1 billion - Bytecoin market cap

There is a major market correction coming, and it’s going to force crypto currencies to go one of two ways. Either way, we win. So stack up, and prepare to buy more because 10 years from now, you won’t be HODLING you will be SPNDING.

   I discovered BCN not too long ago.
I created an account on Poloniex to buy some BCN.
But it has been a while where the BCN wallet is blocked.

So, I tried to find ways, but nothing.
Instead of just waiting, I installed ccminer with my GTX1050 and started to mine.

At first, my desktop wallet wouldn't sync. I was able to find a fix thanks to this forum.
But till can't see my Balance (Even after mining for 24h)
So, I'm downloading the Blockchain (5hours left for download) and will see if I can find my Balance hopefully.

So, does anyone willing to sell me some BCN? Something like $10 or $20 via Paypal (That's about all I can put into it for now). I've been on Paypal for years, and sold things on ebay from time to time, and my feedback is 100% positive. So, there is absolutely no risk to get a charge back.

Have a Happy New Year everyone!

However, despite the pool showing that 204 coins were already paid, I don't see any transactions in my official desktop wallet app. I see however a transaction from an exchange where I bought some BCN (which was after I mined the coin, so it should not be a synchronization problem). 

I had big trouble getting that wallet synchronized, I kept getting ""blockchain loading error"", which in the end I fixed by setting a connection to a remote deamon bcnrps.ebrahma.com:8081.

So my question is, have I been scammed by the pool (which btw has 0% fees, which is strange, how do they make money to run the servers?), or is there a problem with my wallet? Is there any web blockchain explorer where I could verify the transactions?

And I went through the hassle of meticulously waiting for the wallet to sync which took forever (I know wallets usually take a while, but this one was really slow, took almost a week). Once it synced, I went straight to Cryptopia and transferred them to the desktop wallet. Long story short, they never arrived. I opened the wallet today and they still haven't arrived. I literally have in my notes ""They're stuck in limbo for now"".

They're still stuck in limbo somewhere.

Fast forward to today.

I decided to give Bytecoins another shot. I bought some more (much more) at a dip (after making some money from XP) and they're on HitBTC. I checked and they're still there (I always check from time to time because you never know who's going to try to keep you from your funds next.)

Now like the title says, I had to sync the ByteCoin wallet once more and this time it finished syncing in about two days (ending about twenty minutes ago) which I don't really believe because it was at 600,000/1,000,000 the last time I checked and it was going really slow. Unless it suddenly went super speed, I don't believe it.

Now for me I don't know what to do. Do I transfer out of HitBTC or will I lose everything once more? The rule is that you're not supposed to treat an exchange like a bank but when the wallet has already faltered on you once, I'm not sure I want to try agin.

after having some trouble getting my Money to my Wallet (Bought via Changelly.com), I was able to get everything to work like a charm. 

The Wallet took quite some time to sync and even appeared to be stuck at ""last Transaction was 1 Year 5 month ago"". I hesitated to delete my .bytecoin folder and started to investigate more - I even was at a point where I thought Bytecoin was a scam since there are some posts saying that. 
I tried remote syncing nodes and still, I wasn't able to see/receive my money.

After resigning I started to delete Files in the "".bytecoin"" folder ending on ""*.sst"" - make sure to close your Wallet-Client.
I started the Client and let it do its thing, eventually, it successfully synced and I still wasn't able to see any money in my Wallet.

I was just about to delete everything and forget about Bytecoin, but I tried - for the last time - the function ""Reset your Wallet"". It took about 15 Minutes and finally, I saw my money in my Wallet.

I hope I was able to provide useful information.

Happy trading :)",NA,"7i5m5n",NA,0,NA,"false",1515298303,"false","self","t5_31ues","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/BytecoinBCN/comments/7i5m5n/have_trouble_receiving_money_with_your/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

That being said, this coin is already bashed enough. I dont see a reason for it going lower in value than it already is.

Our questions from 12/26 have been heard and answered! Here is Jenny's response to the question we've came up with.**


*Guys, I've made a comments on top-5 questions mentioned at the list above:

    With the 1st and 2nd quarter I see on the roadmap a focus on the Asian and Middle East markets. Are there any specific details as to which markets/exchanges the team is looking into?

We’ve decided to focus on these two markets for several obvious reasons - Bytecoin isn’t so widely spread in these regions and there are a lot of investors who’d be glad to invest in Bytecoin as soon as it’ll be available in their region. Again, the regions we’ve decided to set our focus on weren’t chosen accidentally. Now we’re in the process of launching local communities in the Asian market (Korea and China) and making contacts with several services. Hopefully, this opportunity will be quite successful and we’ll be able to proceed on moves into the Middle East market (of course, considering the region’s specifics).

    Are there any plans to get featured on Coinbase or other similar exchanges for US customers? What's holding Byte back on achieving these exchange/market goals?

Of course, one of the main goals in our marketing vector is to get Bytecoin listed on more exchange platforms. The daily trading volume which was set up this December gives us more opportunities to be considered by the exchange platforms we’re focused on. And of course we are planning to get featured on Coinbase and other major exchanges. However, one has to know that the process of communication with the new partners is quite complicated. In some cases exchanges require too much of a deposit for a listing (10 BTC or even more), some exchanges just can’t implement CryptoNote-based coins because of its difficult technology infrastructure. However, there’s a way on how to speed up the listing process - create several tickets on the exchange platforms you’d like to see Bytecoin on. In this case the exchange platform you’re looking at will pay more attention to us.

    Are there any details on the progress of a more secure wallet for IOS/Android?

Yes, definitely. We’re planning to add the availability of importing and exporting private keys to the mobile apps. Moreover, we’re POC that we’ve made has shown that it’s possible to build a zero-trust wallet on a mobile client.

    Any openings in the future for help on the Development Team or elsewhere? If so, what roles are you looking for the most?

Quite soon we’ll give you the opportunity to help the Development Team by testing the new software and acting as contributors to the software code. However, some cool enthusiasts from our community are now acting as contributors by developing the new and necessary tools (payment plugins, telegram bots, running the new full nodes, mining pools). These actions are making the Bytecoin ecosystem much more user friendly and giving the Dev Team the time and opportunity to focus on the main code base.

    What is/was the problem with the transaction issues on all the exchanges? Was it the fault of BCN, the Exchanges or both? (As people continue to receive the coins, I will modify or get rid of this all together).

As I’ve stated earlier, the problem with the exchanges was caused by fraudulent DDOS attacks on the Bytecoin network. We’ve fixed everything on the behalf of our side and it seems that the network works pretty stably. Some issues still remain (Poloniex and Changelly still haven’t fixed their software), however, these are only a question of time.*


**There we have it everyone. Let me know how you feel about the response we've been given? I planned on making this type of thread every Monday, but if response time is fast enough I will post every other day. This has shown that our voices can be not only heard, but answered as well. I will post again on Monday asking for new questions and getting more ideas from the community! If we want more frequent posts, daily or every other, let me know and I will keep the posts more active.**

Bytecoin is an [open-sourced](https://github.com/amjuarez/bytecoin), private and untraceable cryptocurrency that was started in [2012](https://chainradar.com/bcn/transaction/9afeb29a9f3bd0d84c3d0081c47138c3a1cadd932215b59b146444ba6914e551). 

**Bytecoin** is the first coin that implemented [CryptoNote](https://cryptonote.org/) technology as a default aspect to build a project. Launched in 2012, Bytecoin was widely spread in the Dark Net as one of the popular available methods for payment. The main thing that separates Bytecoin from most of the other coins is total anonymity - as soon as your transaction appears on a blockchain, your address can’t be viewed by anyone. 

Bytecoin has shown a huge growth potential in all of its indexes. Since December 2016 the price per coin has [increased](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bytecoin-bcn/) by 171 times and made over 17000% from growth to the early investors. During the project’s lifetime the amount of users has increased significantly. As of the beginning of December 2017 we have more than 20,000 loyal users (contributors, community enthusiasts, developers, broadcasters, etc.), so Bytecoin’s community is staying as one of the most talented and active ones. Today’s blockchain statistics are also spreading the word that Bytecoin is heading towards mainstream adoption - almost 1,500,000 transactions have been made according to Bytecoin’s [blockchain](https://minergate.com/blockchain/bcn/blocks).  

Bytecoin is the forefather of all of the [anonymous cryptocurrencies](http://mapofcoins.com/bytecoin#) based on CryptoNote technology. Here’s a list of the tech features and specifications Bytecoin has:

**Ring Signatures**

A [Ring signature](https://www.ccn.com/interview-harry-ullman-bytecoin/) is a special type of digital signature that can be created by someone from a group of users, but it is unknown who exactly the signer is. Imagine a letter that is signed by a group of 10 people. You know that one of them signed the letter, but there’s no way to identify who it actually was (you may only guess). This introduces the untraceability property, which means that for any Bytecoin payment there is a number of equal probable senders.

**Unlinkable Transactions**

Unlinkable transactions make the Bytecoin blockchain resistant to being scanned, which means it’s possible to see the details of a user’s transaction, but no one will know the sender or the recipient.

**Stealth Addresses**

With stealth addresses it’s not possible to know the sender and the recipient because of the outputs associated with certain addresses, moreover, it’s impossible to know who belongs to a certain output. 

The complexity of the features above makes Bytecoin absolutely unique. Moreover, Bytecoin’s Development Team has some ideas for the potential improvement of Bytecoin to make it even more anonymous and [reliable](https://bytecoin.org/blog/bytecoin-2018-roadmap-1,-2-quater). 

**Is it profitable to invest in Bytecoin?**

Investing in Bytecoin means: A. Investing in your anonymity, and B. Investing in a breakthrough technology. In fact, investing in Bytecoin seems to be one of the most profitable solutions in  2018 for one only obvious reason - today’s Bytecoin isn’t as widely spread as it is able to be, however, it has a huge potential. For now Bytecoin is only represented on 8 [exchange platforms](https://bytecoin.org/ecosystem), while it is possible to be listed in additional markets, the price has to increase significantly in order to help this come about so that new traders will be able to buy Bytecoins. In this case, investing in Bytecoin today will double your USD deposits by at least twice towards the end of 2018. Moreover, in December 2017 99,5% coins have been mined, which means the emission has to end soon (in about a year), which will definitely lead (according to the [economical model](https://bytecoin.org/about/what-is-bytecoin)) to a slight and stable price growth.

**Where can I buy Bytecoins?**

Here’s a list of the exchange platforms to trade BCN with different cryptocurrencies:

[Poloniex](https://poloniex.com/). Available pairs: BCN/BTC and BCN/XMR.

[HitBTC](https://hitbtc.com/).  Available pairs: BCN/BTC, BCN/USDT, and BCN/ETH.

[Stocks.Exchange](https://stocks.exchange/). Available pairs: BCN/BTC and BCN/ETH.

**Where can I store my coins?**

There are several options on places to store your coins, starting from the exchange platforms which have inner wallets like [Poloniex](https://poloniex.com/), [HitBTC](https://hitbtc.com/), and [Cryptonator](https://www.cryptonator.com/). However, the most secure way to store your coins is to keep it in outside wallets. Here’s a list of wallet options to store your coins:

[Official Desktop Wallet](https://bytecoin.org/downloads). If you’ve faced some difficulties with setting up the wallet, take a look at the [instructions](https://bytecoin.org/docs/bytecoin-wallet-manual) or the [guide](https://coinwalletguide.com/bytecoin-desktop-wallet/).
 
[Official Web Wallet](https://bytecoin.money/#/login).

[Official Android Wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bytecoin.bcn&amp;hl=en).

[Bytecoin Android Wallet by Freewallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bcn.org.freewallet.app&amp;hl=en).
 
[Cryptonator Wallet for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aev.cryptonator&amp;hl=en). 

Choose the best option that is suitable for you and don’t feel shy to ask us for help when setting up your wallet. Please, understand that your wallet is a source where you store your funds. Take it seriously, use all the available protection methods (backups, mnemonics, 2FA, complicated passwords), but rely mostly on yourself and never forget your app credentials (keep them somewhere else except in your mind).

I'm aware of the option to download the blockchain but I'm using a separate laptop solely for my ""cryptowallet"", and I'm wary of downloading ANYTHING from outside the official pages for different cryptocurrencies and their official wallet download links.

I see that I can add pools to the wallet application, of which mine is still synchronizing, but there is no GPU option so I'm unsure if this method would be any faster.

We’ve seen your messages about the complicated process of buying Bytecoin caused by the transferring another currencies to the exchange platforms, verification on them, high fees on some markets and so on. For sure, the main approach to simplify the process of buying BCN is to make it listed on more exchanges, but the developers of the Web Wallet have suggested the alternative way of buying BCN. We’ve seen a lot of queries on reddit and telegram and decided to accept their idea. Meet the new function - direct purchasing of Bytecoin from your Web Wallet with BTC! 

The function is available for every BCN user who has the Web Wallet and the external BTC Wallet. Placing the order in a few clicks, your BTC order automatically goes to the exchange platform and then returning in BCN equivalent with the small fee which helps the Web Wallet devs to maintain the system. There’s no need to pay extra high commission anymore by using the external services, as far as we allow you now to store and buy BCN at the same place. 

Feel free to share your thoughts about this implementation and suggest us more features you’d like to see in our projects.

In late October I sent 25,000 BCN to myself. From Poloniex to my personal Bytecoin wallet. I had been one version 1.1.6 at the time I think. Regardless, the bytecoins never came through to my wallet.

I even used excel and took my wallet address and the destination address from poloniex and did a comparison (using =EXACT() ) on them and they are exactly the same.

I tried upgrading to a newer version for the Bytecoin client, downgrading to a lower version. Also manually downloading and replacing blockindexes.bin abd blocks.bin. I also tried totally uninstalling then restoring the wallet file and letting it manually sync which took like 3 days total. using remote daemon bcnrps.ebrahma.com:8081

Nothing seems to get my coins in to my wallet. Does any one have any idea at all what happened or how to get this resolve at all?

I have two wallets, one that my miners send money to, and one that I hold more funds in.

My mining wallet seems fine and gets transactions regularly.

My holding wallet does not.

I sent myself approximately 10k BCN about 2 weeks ago from HitBTC.  For the first 10 days or so they sat pending on HitBTC citing wallet/network stability issues.  On the 24th those transactions finally showed posted from HitBTC and I have two transaction hashes:

92e8a7414667af5699c3464d5a08d160c00c92567e920c4961e5602dc1c165a5

32142ab1810e1be354aa69910ef6773e3d6e191edfe18da64ed4b69c5080c4dc

My wallet address is:

25R7fsTa1ZBEWVqBfAK8M8ZXFDDhAhRR45tkQjAbdTTgKh9stDwt6sVTtnESaiWg86dYZwvHo6yJK2aBQoRLppGfF7kTRK4

I wanted to give it a couple days before I started to get on the scam bandwagon, so here I am, still with a zero balance.

I realize 10k BCN isn't much, so I'm not sweating it too much, but I'm certainly not going to invest any more into this coin if I can't get this resolved.

Can anyone help me look at these transactions to see if there is an obvious issue or not?


EDIT:

My mining wallet is on linux and my holding wallet is on Windows.  I had been running a full node/daemon and had my wallets pointed at that.  For testing purposes I downloaded the full blockchain and have the wallets pointed at local copies now. 

Windows wallet is 1.1.9.3.  Shows wallet synchronized to block height 1428349.

In the block explorer in the wallet, it does not see either of the transaction hashes I linked above that chainradar shows.

EDIT 2: 

Good news!  I opened the wallet that was not showing a balance and exported my private key.  I then created a new wallet and imported the private keys from the original one, effectively restoring the wallet backup.

The wallet did a full re-sync with the existing block chain (didn't download it again) and now it shows the correct balance!",NA,"7mb2sy",NA,0,NA,"false",1515380302,"false","self","t5_31ues","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/BytecoinBCN/comments/7mb2sy/lost_coins_can_anyone_help_me_understand/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

If anyone would be able to help me out with a few donations to help get me started it would be much appreciated! Thanks! And Merry Christmas/ Happy Holidays.

- ""Look before you leap."" Make sure the wallet you decide to use is compatible with the currency you mine or trade to acquire. Any error or loss I have experienced has solely been on my part. Occasionally contacting support has garnered a refund.

- Triple check addresses before confirming any transactions. I use the online BCN wallet not the desktop one. I have a bit more piece of mind knowing I dont need to wait to sync or if my hardware burns out losing everything.

- Ask questions in group chats or forums. People seem quite friendly in the community. As long as you are not asking for handouts more often than not people will answer your questions.

- Be patient. I see posts where people claim scam. Part of the reason I made this post is so people new to this can see starting up in crypto doesn't require investing money or buying coin. BCN is great in that i can mine about 40 a day ( I have sub-par equipment). Read those FAQs and tutorials.

As we all know, Byte has grown substantially this past month. With this growth of course we have increased the number of people here as well. Because of this I see new people posting questions repeatedly, many of which are the exact same and go unanswered or seen. 

 I'd like to start this post as a ground zero for the main questions people new and long term have. I will post weekly on Monday (excluding yesterday cause of holiday for many) to gather the main issues and ideas the community has and come Thursday I'd like to gather the top 3-5 that we'd like answered. This should give ample time for us to collect our thoughts and for the dev team to come up with detailed respones. I know Jenny tried something like this before, but we were too few and small and we fell away from it very quickly. 

 This can only work as long as we the community come together and help grow even more. I'm not alone in wanting this coin to grow and have a global impact, but we gotta start somewhere and organize a little. Let's make 2018 our year! 

I will start off with a question of my own and with new questions coming in, I'll post the most requested ones on top here. Questions can be replaced, but want at least 3-5 that are deemed the best to be asked of the week. 


**1. With the 1st and 2nd quarter I see on the roadmap the focus on Asian and Middle East market. Any specific details as to which markets/exchanges the team is looking into?**

**2. Are there any plans to get featured on Coinbase or other like exchanges for US customers? What's holding Byte back on achieving these exchange/market goals?**

**3. Is there any details on the works of a more secured wallet for IOS/Android?**

**-4. Any openings in the future for help on the Development Team or elsewhere? If so, what roles are you looking for the most?**

**-5. What is/was the problem with the transaction issues on all the exchanges? Was it fault on BCN, Exchanges or both? (As people continue to receive the coins, I will modify or get rid of this all together)**


If questions get answers before Thursday, I will post the answers along side the questions.

Last night I decided to move 100k to my BCN wallet on Cryptonator. I kept getting a ""Wrong Amount"" error if I tried to send more than 100 BCN at a time. I tried different amounts, some went through but most didn't. As of this morning, I have 23,000 BCN in my wallet, with 10,000 making it to my Cryptonator account. My question is, what now? I searched all of the cancelled transactions on the block chain, and none could be found. I'm worried my coins are lost forever. Does anyone have any ideas?

I want to share my experience with bytecoin.uk pool.
I have received the coin every 50 bcn but only one time appeared to me that I have unlocked a block and have to receive 147 bcn... nothing came to my wallet.
After that I continue to mine and the 50 bcn transaction came regularly.

It was a scam? I can’t understand.

I want to get refunded...

I included a PDF as well for those that can't open that, or just want to use an image manipulator. Or even better, figure out how to code this into one of those generator thingies! :)

1) completly invalidate all the coins in the block chain before the public release date. Thereby adding to the total left to mine. 
2) Fork and allow all transactions/coin conversions completed in a certain time frame.   The coins either show up,  or they are gone forever. 
3)allow a single one time transaction of all the missing coins on this chain before a certain date by the holder (if there is one)  then invalidating.
4)continue down the same path and deal with low value and ""hope"" billions of coins just dont show up.  


As a BCN holder and supporter I want to see this addressed once and for all.    I know many many people agree. So let's make this happen and put XMR and its smart ass, spiteful devs in thier place.

So as you were interested for, here is your mining tutorial for Nvidia GPUs on Windows (it might work on Linux with some tweaking but I can't guarantee it). It'll mostly focus on the adjustments you can make to your miner so you have an optimal and stable hash per second.

For this tutorial, I'll be using ccminer and the bytecoin.uk pool even if you can use an other one, it's as you please.

* First of all, you have to download [CUDA drivers](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) for your graphic card, it'll allow you to mine, otherwise you'll have compatibility errors. Install it and we'll start to play with the miner.

* Then, you'll have to download the [last release of ccminer](https://github.com/tpruvot/ccminer/releases). I recommend here to use the tpruvot's version but you can find other links [here](http://ccminer.org/) if you'd like to explore a bit deeper. Just extract it in a folder.

* To setup your miner, I recommend to use a script where you just have to complete some parameters. I give you [mine](https://pastebin.com/zxRwE7pi) but you'll have to tweak it to fit your own setup, it's the setup for a GTX 660. Save this script in a .bat file inside of the ccminer folder you've created above.

* Now double click on your .bat file and it should start to mine for you ! You can follow your hashrate and how many coins you have mined by going on bytecoin.uk website. You can start as much machines as you want on the same wallet address.

**Interesting details**

Today, it's almost impossible to mine alone, if you want to mine *alone*, you would have to create a farm like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jqf_wZKFCc) (ok, I'm exagerating a bit but you've got the idea), that's why we are using bytecoin.uk pool. It's got almost 1/10 of the entire network hash and the developper is very active. If you need further information about the pool, you can contact the dev on [Discord](https://discord.gg/cmRN2xD).

**Enjoy !**

This is Jenny Goldberg, Marketing Manager at Bytecoin. I am writing to you about the Bytecoin situation on Poloniex. We were unfrozen on your service over the weekend but as of Monday Bytecoin is frozen again. Can anyone please tell us what is going on? Many of our users have been enquiring with us about this situation so if there is anything anyone can do to help it would be much appreciated. 

If there are any developers or users with contacts with Poloniex we would be grateful if you could bring this post to their attention. We have tried to write to their support but have yet to receive a response.

Hope to hear from you soon,

This is my first post and the reason being the trouble I had to go through for last 1 week to sync my Bytecoin wallet. I tried everything, connecting node in RPC, syncing for a week and finally gave up. Then, a friend of mine who already had a synced wallet helped me via sharing his already downloaded Bytecoin Blockchain. You just have to replace these 2 files with an already created file on your Bytecoin wallet folder. This blockchain is updated until January 26, 2018.

INSTRUCTIONS: Download 2 files blocks.bin and blockindexes.bin, from below link and follow the process.

https://www.dropbox.com/sh/2lm70m1azan8poz/AABvHKbPKuajHzX9DbOwt_d7a?dl=0


How to setup a blockchain downloaded from this site
--------------------------------------------------

First,  Close all Bytecoin related apps and services: Bytecoin Wallet
==================================================

For WINDOWS:

1. Open Windows Explorer

2. Type %APPDATA%\bytecoin for the directory path and press Enter to open it

3. Replace the existing blocks.bin and blockindexes.bin files with new downloaded file in %APPDATA%\bytecoin 


MAC OS X:

1.Go to Finder Select GoSelect go to Folder and type ~/.bytecoin and press Enter

2.Replace the existing blocks.bin and blockindexes.bin files with new downloaded file in directory ~/.bytecoin 


LINUX:

1.	Replace files inside ~/.bytecoin by downloaded blocks.bin and blockindexes.bin


Once done, reopen the Bytecoin wallet, it will take some time to sync all the blocks from the added DB, 45 min- 1 hr or a bit more. Once done, the wallet will sync with latest bloackchain and ready to use.

Hope it will help.

Feel free to let me know for any difficulties.

Kindly give a thumbs up, if it works by some donation. Thank you.

The Bytecoin team - got back to me with this mail - returning my money/Bytecoin. I did choose option one, since I just want more Bytecoin - and I guess it really makes it easier for the Bytecoin team just to exchange.... see the mail I got below.

-------------------------------------
Hello there!

Sorry for the late reply.

It’s a pity to hear that you’ve faced this problem with the exchange. Probably this issue was caused by the process of sending BTC from the exchange platform, but not from the external BTC wallet.

There are two variants of solving your issue:

1 Exchange with the actual rate. In this case you’ll be deposited with BCN at the actual BTC/BCN price on the moment of sending. Note that the amount of BCN you’ll receive may differ by either bigger or smaller amount according to the actual exchange rates.  

Or you can be refunded with BTC.

2 To complete the refund kindly provide us with the following info:

- Your bytecoin.money username.
- Your email.
- The amount of BTC you’ve used to make the transfer.
- The BTC address for the refund (your personal BTC address).
- Your BCN address you've used to make an order.
- Link to the block explorer with the transaction hash.
- Please, choose the option you want and reply us. Sorry for any inconvenience. 

Best,

I think it’s about time the team get this coin on more exchanges, like Bleutrade and Coinexchange.io for example. Those are relatively small exchanges with the same coins as what Bytecoin is. Low cost coin, but less trouble with withdrawal problems for sure. Not a huge step but it’s at least something. 

Not only Bytecoin has problems with Poloniex and HitBTC, there are a lot of other coins which deal with the same problems, and the support team of both exchanges don’t respond to dev teams also. For example SiaCoin has the same problems. Dev’s can’t get in contact with support, no response at all. Just has been blocked for an unknown reason.

So Minergate is on the whole considered to be a fair service (despite some online claims they steal your h/s?). However, Freewallet online (including Reddit) is repeatedly claimed to be a scandal. Yet Freewallet and Minergate appear to be business partners. For example Minergate allows 'free' transfers and a lower withdraw amount to Freewallet compared to a regular withdrawal.

So my questions are: 1) what is the relationship between these two? 2) Can they both be trusted? 

I ask this here because both of these services work with BCN.

I'm forced to use one site to deposit the USD, then convert to one of maybe 6 different coins. Once I have that coin I will need to xfer it to site two, from which I can then convert to BCN. 

I created a table manually in excel to help me calculate between using BTC or LTC as the middle coin as I'd heard LTC would be cheaper. This may be because fees are different, but based on the current exchange rates I would net just over 200 more BCN if I xfer through BTC instead of LTC. 

Having to do it manually got me thinking how nice it would be to have a site that allows you to choose your starting holding (USD, BTC, PAC, whatever), select your destination holding, then present you a selection of 'roadmaps', the fees at each point, and your final tally for your destination holding. 

An example would be: USD to LTC at coinbase, then send LTC to cryptonator then LTC to BCN at cryptonator. If I start with $500, how many BCN will I end with at current prices? Now what if I start USD to BTC and follow same roadmap? Or is there a cheaper roadmap? 

If I had access to realtime valuations via some sort of excel linked RSS or something I could manually enter fees for my own roadmap and do the calculations, but Crypto isn't new. What I'm looking for has to exist right?

Anyone have a link?

I know Stratum is done server side and have tried my -f to no avail of course but is there ANYTHING I can do about this? The best way to mine I Have found is close and re-open the script about ever 3-5 mins. This bring maximal reward but is extremely annoying.

I am completely new to cryptocurrencies. I've been reading a lot about it, and I have also attend some meetings in my spare time about crypto and the technology off blockchain behind it. At this time I think I know enough about it to buy some.

So today, after verification process at some exchanges finally completed, I've purchased my first cryptocurrencies. I've bought myself some Bitcoin and Ethereum on Coinbase (I think i've made my first mistake there, because transactions cost for transferring Bitcoin to my wallet where extremely high). I transfered my Ethereum to Binance and traded it for some Ripple.

So I now have some Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple. I also wanted to buy some Bytecoin, but unfortunately, BCN cannot be traded on Binance. I only wanted to buy a small amount of it (I've mined 100 of them with MinerGate, which took over a week with 2 pc's, so I will not do that anymore).

So how do I purchase, let's say €25 of BCN and store them in the bytecoinwallet on my desktop?

Thanks in advance!

PS: is there also a cheaper way of buying Bitcoins?

When bytecoin.uk started, I gave all my support possible for him to fix the problems, I shared ideas, warnings about pool problems, I publicized the pool in the intention to help him and help the currency, all knowing he had told me that when it was all right he would release the code to help the community, more pools more people knowing the currency, finding out, etc.
And I would also like to have a pool in my country, where I would call and teach people how to mine and so publicize the coin. Now I went to ask if he could share the pool code for the public seeing that apparently everything is all right.
And he simply said, ""I do not share the source of my pool.""

My question is: If the pool is no fee, just to help the community. Why not share and still betray a friend who has lost hours and money helping you? In my view, the more pools the bytecoin has around the world, the owners of the pools will disclose the mining / currency to get more miners. so why not share? and most importantly, what are you profiting from it?

You are not helping the community as you promised. I feel bad for you.

I have just tested gambling on luckygames.io. Everything worked like a charm. Registration is kinda obscure. I just have entered nickname, password and thats it. I have send bytecoins and in few minutes i have had my bytecoins deposited at luckygames. 
I have succesfully lost my coins tehre (LOL xD). I have chesked withdrawal options too. 

You can choose from:

Low priority transaction (fee 0,1 BCN)
Medium priority transaction (fee 0,5 BCN)
High priority transaction (fee 1,0 BCN)

I guess it just influence speed of transaction but i havent tested this yet because i didnt have any BCN left to test LOL :D 

Good luck to those of you who want to test your luck at the site. At least more luck that i had :D.

I am kinda bored today. Thanks to those who will send me some BCN to gamble through out the night :D

I've gotten into crypto the last few months and have purchased various coins from several different exchanges, but I've never given mining a consideration. I'm very clueless about the lingo (GPUs, nodes, etc.) and not a techie by any stretch of the imagination, so I've always shyed away from it. However, I've gotten the impression that BCN mining might not be so intimidating, so I'd like to learn more about it. BCN seems like a solid longterm investment. Can you help me understand mining and what it takes to start?

I only have a Macbook Pro (circa 2011) and I use it several hours daily.  Can I also use this for mining ByteCoin?

If you use your home computer, do you have to leave it running constantly?  Does this end up costing more in electricity than simply buying ByteCoin from an exchange?

How much BCN would I expect to mine daily with a basic setup like this?  

Would I be better off going to BestBuy and dropping say $500 on a basic PC and just leave it turned on all the time for BCN mining?

I checked multiple pages like HitBTC, Poloniex, Cryptonator, Coinspot, etc. all of them have tedious ways of verifying and shady user reviews which hold me off trading there. I read that there is a BCN web wallet which allows you to buy directly via BTC. The problem is, there is only a 20min time limit and I can't risk losing my money because Coinbase doesn't transfer it fast enough. (Sending via Binance should be faster but still I would have to pay twice the BTC transaction fee which is insane). There are already some posts about users here that didn't receive their BTC in the BCN webwallet.

Is there some other way to obtain them fairly easy? Mining isn't an option for me. If there is no page like that, is there somebody willing to trade BCN for my Paypal or other currency?

decided to buy a small amount using the web wallet, registration and login etc were successful but the transfer timed out. 

BTC is gone (confirmed transaction) and never showed up in the web wallet (4 hrs later), so it appears the wallet issues are true, at least for now. I guess i should have learned others having issues.

I have sent a message to bcn_official, only hours ago. But thought others should know. I also tried poloniex but as others have stated it has been disabled.

Might be a good idea to disable the web wallet as well until the issues are resolved.

Nonetheless, I'm asking all you old and new investors of BCN to not freak out, especially if the price drops, which is inevitable. For you day traders, it'll be Christmas, but for HODLers, KEEP HODLing! 

It's only the beginning of 2018 and we're already nearly half way back to where we should be, back to 200 satoshi. It's not going to happen overnight, but with time we'll get there. 


&amp;nbsp;

Hopefully we can keep the volume going up and at it for a long time to show Poloniex and other exchanges the potential of BCN, and what it should have been in 2017.

Most of the market's hot coins, two that come to mind, XRP and STR/XLM, are down, which I believe helps because people might jump ship from them to BCN. Seeing BCN's % change sure is tempting of FOMO.


&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR

Devs: Keep it up, please communicate with us moreso than ever

Investors: Do I really need to say anything? **HODL** &amp; don't give in to panic selling

Future Investors: It's not too late, if I'm being honest, just wait till the dip to ~60 satoshi, imo its bound to happen, and then people will start panicking and selling. More profit for you hopefully!

The big bugs that have been found (that were first found in XMR) have been handled, and BCN team has also been able to get rid of their image of BCN being a scam. There is a desktop wallet but also a web wallet that, at least at the time of writing this, seems to work just fine. Also the addition of being able to buy BCN directly from the web wallet with BTC is a great bonus, but it doesn't solve the main issue BCN currently faces: It's listed to next to no exchanges.



BCN according to coinmarketcap.com is listed to Poloniex, which lately has been a complete mess, literally unusable. From big exchanges the only other one is HitBTC, which has been (once again, at least for me) really laggy lately as a trading site in general. Then there is one smaller exchange, and you can trade other cryptos into BCN with Changelly, although Changelly scams people with their policies. Therefore, the biggest blockage on the way of our lovely BCN's growth is that it's not listed to enough exchanges by having only one major exchange available. Getting BCN listed to other exchanges would make it available to more people and there would be more recognition for the true original private crypto.



Also, if BCN could get listed to more exchanges while the team would make themselves a more transparent group, that would especially help to get people into this that originally thought BCN was a scam based on mainly a post on bitcointalk talking about Adobe signatures and stuff related to Bytecoin. The team made a post to this subreddit (which is still pinned) where they say that BCN would start a new generation, and I feel like these two things (mainly the exchanges) need to be handled before we can say we have truly entered a new era of BCN.",NA,"7ofao3",NA,0,NA,"false",1518500009,"false","self","t5_31ues","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/BytecoinBCN/comments/7ofao3/the_absolute_number_1_priority_to_handle_for_bcns/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

However my BCN balance on bytecoin.money is still showing zero. The actual transaction timeout after 20 minute or so. I have sent an email to bytecoin.org support 2 days ago, but no response yet. The transaction happened on the 5th of Jan.

How do I get the money back that I paid for the transaction? I do have the BTC waller address used for this transaction by the bytecoin.money web site.

The application Minergate has a much better system, where you can see the progress while mining and after every 20 coins, it gets transfered to your wallet. 

More mining information, stats while mining and smaller more frequent payouts while mining via the wallet app would be great.

i understand if it is a SECRET, but my concern as a holder is that, the more you guys delay your plans the harder you guys will catch up with the competition. im sure you guys know ripple. and its becoming successful right now in japan and korea through various large business partnerships. what i want to point here is that, you guys will have a fierce and hard competition in asian market that gets harder each day the more you guys delay action, which is why i am asking for detailed plan because i want to know if there are any progress at all and so that we know what to do with our expectations for this year and in order to plan or decide what to do next.

ANYWAY, that's only ripple... there are other alt coins that are already near 1 usd or more that are also or already entering the asian market and do marketing and partnerships. which means more competition = more harder... in analogy, the early bird (altcoins entering the asian market) catch the early (BEST) worm (business partners and potential coin buyers). if there are too many EARLY birds that manage to get the BEST worms, will the late birds still get a worm? maybe, but it will be the small ones. 

basing the trends, surely by march, ripple could be 5 usd or more... cardano could be 3. stellar could become 1.50... this are some coins that are very active in asian market and there's BITCOIN, the GOD of cryptocurrency. my concern is that people that already bought BCN coins might consider selling their coins the transfer to this other alt coins so they can finally gain profit. and if that happens, AKA massive sell out of BCN coins it will make harder for BCN to grow. that is what you guys surely dont want to happen.

I do see it go as low as 170 and as high as 400, but most times it hovers around 250-300. I have been mining solo and averaged 23BCN/day (this includes that confirmed AND unconfirmed). Now the calculator provided by MinerGate tells me I should be getting about 80 per day.

I am using a couple of old laptops that I had lying around, so at this point it's more of an experiment for me. I wanted to get a taste for it before I dedicate any fiat $$ and scale up.

My question: Are there any settings that I need to tweak? why is there such a discrepancy between what I get and what they say I should be getting? I mean 4x difference is pretty big, isn't it?

I've contacted Jenny directly and am waiting for a hopeful response. From her comment this morning, Jenny and the devs seem like are up to the idea of trying to contact Amazon whether it is futile or not.  It might generate some buzz and let others know that Bytecoin is looking for partnership and increase development to get this coin on the ground and running.  Nothing is official as of yet, I just see that they show some interest in the idea. 

I'm asking those of the community and those who stumble upon this post to bug Amazon. Through social media, contacts from Amazon website, creating post on other currency forums, literally anything. If nothing else, create some buzz in the crypto communities.

I know there are some of you that think this is idiotic and it'll never work.  But maybe what Bytecoin needs is some jump start attention rather than slow progress, especially now.  If we generate enough buzz around the idea Amazon might in the slightest mention the Bytecoin name somewhere. Any correlation we can generate with a company Amazon will only be positive PR. 
Viral things come from the smallest places and with enough chatter I know we can get something going here.

Like I said, nothing is official yet, the devs just seem interested in the idea.

And oddly, I don't have enough ""karma"" to reply to their post saying its not. 

At any rate - Hi community! Yes, that was my first post. This is my second. I've been reading for a while, and had no reason to post until a short while ago, after I made my first successful BCN buy via the BCN wallet. I just started investing in crypto's a month ago, mostly in XRP, QSP, TRX. I liked BCN for a number of reasons, and frustrated like the rest of you that it was difficult if not impossible to purchase. 

When I recently read the post from Jenny that the wallet is working (new years present), I decided to give it a shot and transferred BTC from Binance. It worked well! Just as a note, I purchased over 200k.. not a tiny sum, not something ridiculously large either. 

I'm a former wallstreet trader of 10 yrs (hung it up after 2009 collapse, too stressful) and moved on to other things; so I'm not new to investing or reading charts, etc. I liked the recent spike in BCN volume above average, despite the fact its not available easily. Interest is there in this coin, and it has one of the best ideas/potential going for it, particularly relative to its incredibly modest price.

Anyway, Thanks again for all the great info and conversations that fueled my interest even further in BCN.. Looking forward to posting more here.

Please consider creating state by state appointed official reps so we can have seminars to help people set it up within their own businesses to stream line partnerships. People would be putting there own time into this project so no pay to be expected. It would also be good for anyone having problems with their wallets/hardware to be able to show up somewhere speak to a rep and have them resolve the simple issues almost like apple's ""geniuses."" Plus showing up on site with a node for the block chain to provide faster sync would make all the ""i haven't received my funds Q_Q"" spam posts slow down.

Another point is take a look at those shitty MLM scams in your city, people do show up for those shit shows knowing they are getting scam. But with this project being about building business partnerships and turning BCN into a full fledged international digital currency we could definitely get a lot of positive attention and alot more new faces involved. Having usage of the BCN forum creating geographic sub sections so reps can directly update people would help and allow the real mods to keep an eye on what information reps are sharing with people because it only takes 1 ass hole in 1 city to take money for some sketchy sale shit on site which isnt allowed and i question if it is legal. But needless to say for legals sake we'd also have to collect video and audio data for possible review of the seminars just to be safe and store them on a server for reps just like a real job.

Which I did, and it appears it does it so fast that I almost always notice in the left lower side status of 'Wallet Syncronized' Soo, once in a while I change it back to 'Auto' and restart and go thru the syncing, which in almost all cases take more than a day, for ex; I ran this yesterday evening and as of this writing it is still syncronizing, prolly for another 4-5 hours. I want to know if this is a good practice or Not. Should I just leave it at Auto all the time. Plus, is there ever a need at all to keep the wallet syncronized ?!? other than the fact that I want to make sure I still my coins in my wallet intact!

Anyone with the same issue? 
Maybe anyone solved this in the past? 

EDIT: Since I'm new in this, the problem was that i didn't saved my wallet keys. And I ran the BytecoinWallet software twice, meaning that the bytecoinwallet.wallet file was overriden the second time. 
I have now solved the issue, and was able to sync the blockchain faster following this post: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1827687.0

**1.** *With various skill sets throughout the community, what are the most beneficial things the community can do to help push Byte forward?*

**2.** *Could we have a status update on wallet issues? What's the biggest problem the wallet is having?*

**3.** *Any update on the issues with Poloniex? Is there anything the community can do to assist?*

is any of these places can get in trouble during the hard fork?

Do i need to download the desktop wallet so i could make a back up that after the hardfork i could get my coins back or they will be secure in the mobile and web wallets as to I am quite confused to what to do and how to prepare for this fork as I also dont want to leave the coins on a exchange.

┼NXT  ┼ARDR  ┼IGNIS  ┼BCN

╴My plan is to move to cold storage, off-line to vest for 2 years. During which time I will exit the community and all things crypto, so I can  focus on pursuing other goals. 
╴But, If I had to start from 0, or if I had to sell all but one to hold, I would keep Bytecoin (BCN).
Valued at $0.006USD per coin at the time of this writing (–10% 7 day average) It has the most potential for growth, long term. It’s a slow gainer but relatively less volatile, 6 years active and provably unbreakable. Widely distributed globally with density in France and China. Active dev team, open community, easily mined with CPUs, mobile phones and other consumer hardware. Variable anonymity conditions that could allow regulation, but when powerful mining rigs aren’t required, the only way a government could effectively enforce a ban on BCN, would be to seize and repo any device with a CPU, computers and cellphones, from all citizens and completely shut down the internet.  

*   Many, if not most, of the core dev team is French speaking which is a valuable edge towards adoption throughout Africa and SE Asia. BCN nodes are gradually populating at a constant rate throughout middle-east, India, and China, Brazil, Venezuela, the real places with real problems.

**  Adoption in China, the gateway to SE Asia where Mandarin and French are common languages, due to centuries of French colonization in Vietnam, Thailand, etc. And, also French is the language used to facilitate “trade” (i.e. colonization) and general communication between largely Chinese and African governments.
        
***Looking at NEM as a competitor (New Economy Movement, native SE Asia startup which forked from EU based NXT) tracking it’s success, and rate of adoption starting at BCN’s current price, to present, NEM has leveled off recently, and this may be due to the complex nature of the code and the interface, again possibly creating a barrier to adoption, in the near term. Bytecoin is much more approachable to new or first time users.

Hello and happy new year all,


i am among many other Bytecoin holders having funds frozen by Poloniex for some unclear reasons for now about 10 days. I personally hold about $50,000 usd in coins which is probably quite a large sum by bytecoin standards. Funds were sent and confirmed to Poloniex but never credited. 


You mentionned few days ago that you unsuccessfully tried to get in touch with Poloniex to solve any issue they may have:

What is the reason behind so many interferences and technical issues? Are these only technical problems or is there a specific agenda we are unaware of? It is easy to start to believe in market manipulation theories with such a track record. All these deposit / withdrawal issues greatly hinder credibiliy into the bytecoin project, and i don’t understand why these problems are not addressed in a more decisive way by the exchanges and the Bytecoin development team.


I am not pointing the finger at anybody yet, but someone is responsible here. The very essence of a successful currency is to be reliable, easily exchanged and widely accepted as a mainstream mean of payment. How can this be achieved if such trivial problems as deposits and withdrawals are not fixed?


Anyhow, any update or guidance as of how to fix the situation would be greatly appreciated

Thank you

Best

I see this is a fairly old coin too.  

Any hidden dramas with this? Dev team communicate much?  Looked on the web page but couldn't find a bytecoin team info list, any around?

I've been mining BCN for 4 days now (ccminer x64 v2.2.3 cuda - Bytecoin Wallet v1.1.9.3 - GTX1050 - 280H/s)

At first, my wallet synced only one out of 10 times, and my balance was 0 during my second day of mining

I followed some fixes offered in this forum.
1. Put a manual node into settings (made the wallet sync, but balance still 0)
2. Downloaded the Blockchain manually (Of that same day) (showed a 51.0000 BCN balance from one transaction)

in my ccminer , my wallet address is correct.

The 51 BCN intrigues me. Because it's a Whole Number. I would expect to receive a Real Number from mining. Also, multiple small transactions.
I don't know where these 51 BCN came from (Unless it's from my mining)

But I also don't know why I can't see the rest of my balance, because I've been making Bytecoins for 4 days now...

I've seen that message about the Alfa Desktop wallet, that will apparently solve the balance and transactions issues.

But, what about my transactions? How can I know if they are existing, instead of non-existing.
How can I know that it's just an issue, and that I will get my Balance once that Alfa Desktop Wallet is out.
Is there any way to know?

I was told to wait for the wallet to sync, but I honestly have no idea if mine is synced. In the bottom it says synchronized and then disconnected, but when it has a peer it shows that it's syncing. Is this why my bcn isn't in my wallet? 

I've been reading that people who's wallet aren't synced need to add nodes so it syncs. I've added a node but I don't really see any difference.

 The problem I see the most are those having to deal with wallets. The Online wallet, besides the awesome addition in being able to buy straight from the wallet, is creating issues for some people.  For now I would just bite the bullet and download the desktop wallet using the auto sync rather than a remote daemon(you can try, didn't work as well for me). The block chain takes awhile to download but as soon as you get it downloaded everything should be smooth. I have yet to run into any problems.

If when you start downloading the wallet and the blockchain seems to stop downloading for hours if not a full day, just delete the wallet entirely, I mean everything in any folder or in downloads, just trash it (remember to back up and remember your password and address) and you should be fine. Re-download it and it should quickly pick up where it left off, atleast it did for me. 

For those asking where to buy bitcoin, I have a quick solution. Go to Coinbase, like most others do, and buy some BTC. Instead of sending it from there, create a GDAX.com account. They are owned by Coinbase so it's reputable. From Coinbase  you can now send what BTC you have to your balance on GDAX. The whole point of this is to avoid some ridiculous fees that Coinbase has.  It shouldn't cost much, if anything to then send your BTC to the exchange we will use to buy Bytecoin, called Cryptonator. I recently posted about me having problems here but I soon realized it was on my end that the problem was coming from.  From my experience Cryptonator has been the smoothest and easiest site to use. Once you make an account there, you can easily create an exchangeable BTC and BCN wallet. Send your BTC from GDAX to the Cryptonator BTC wallet. You can then exchange it into Bytecoin on the same site and then send to your wallet.  it literally takes 3-5 mins from me buying BTC on Coinbase to having my Bytecoin in my desktop wallet.

Bytecoin deserves to advance in this crypto currency era.  It's been here for so long long and the devs, albeit slow on responses sometimes, know what they are doing. I expect to see huge changes in the coming year and hopefully beyond. 

Hope this helps for some of you��

First let me thank you for your work. 

I have a small suggestion/question for you. Its about the wallet https://bytecoin.money. When i want to log in with two factor security. When i want to log in, first i am asked to do the ""Iam not a robot"" captcha. Then when i pass the ""find something in the pictures"" test i can enter my code from google authenticator and then i have to do ""I am not a robot"" test all over again. 

Why is that? I think there should be just one captcha right? I would consider this bug, or just an annoying feature that dont add much of a protection but is really pain in the ass. 

What do you fellow bytecoiners think about that? Upvote if you think this should be changed.

Regards Slav3k

From the newest to hottest threads opened so far I learned that:

-Max supply is expected to be reached in @ 11 months with the current emission rate;

-Peeps throw shit at Poloniex for temporarily blocking deposits and withdraws now and again for so-called wallet/network issues - probably after the hardfork it will stabilize;

-Peeps throw sht at Minergate for ""stealing hashpower (??)"" - not tested but a good point to look at.

-Details mattering pre-mined coins are yet to be clarified since I only know that ""the roumors are fake and it was a scam"", no further effort/blockchain analysis(or if i'm wrong please reply!)

Idk if there are any other issues or points worth mentioning as the roadmap seems clear, and apart from the need of more transparent and active community manager as everybody requests, peeps seems to be enjoying the situation of Bytecoin.

I personally will keep mining, holding and hoping.

Best of luck!

Read several things. But... I would like to know what the best and easiest way to buy BCN in the UK is, with lowest fees and secure outcome. 

I'm looking to buy between £1-10 maybe more. 
But I don't want to go through the long process of going to buy BTC then exchange to something and then use something to exchange to BCN.

Unless anyone is willing to donate or sell some through PayPal. Please let me know. Don't have the machines ti mine my self. :( 

Thank you very much!

However recent activity with amazon makes it seem like they are trying to enter into the cryptocurrency world, looking at the last month or so. Especially now with the new year, I think Bytecoin devs should try to show there faces, make themselves known. Amazon could potentially be the partnership of a lifetime, and especially because Bytecoin offers something different than many of the other currencies out there currently, it could stand out. Taking into account that Bytecoin is one of the older currencies and have been in the market much longer. 

Jenny or any other devs if your reading, do you think it would be possible to even try to contact them? Let them know you have something to offer. I'm no expert on implementation in the slightest, but I could see amazon using a currency like Bytecoin for their massive online markets. Especially with coming updates that are planned with wallets and addition of updated blockchain tech I can see this as a possibility. Looking at the roadmap for the coming year as an outsider, I see an opportunity, as difficult and competitive as it might be, but it would be worth a shot to make yourself known.  A partnership like that would only mean a melding of dev ideas and skills that would only make the coin better.  And especially now with such a huge increase of interest in cryptocurrency, Bytecoin should be more aggressive on its presence. From my perspective I couldn't see a more crucial time to have people know Bytecoin, even more so with so many new investors. I'd like to see you guys be a pillar of currencies like bitcoin, lite coin, and etherium have somewhat become.

if youre one of those lucky people that have no wallet problems pls dont be annoyed!

Anyway...

Ive had the Zero balance problems for a month now on my desktop wallet. I tried synchronizing the wallet from multiple sources but this is the first time Ive had some progress...

Ive let it synchronize with the Auto-seleciton and it took around 2 weeks. It still shows zero balance, but this time at least i can see some data in the pool stats area (transactions and such).

Which is a good thing i guess, cuz until today the wallet was generating literally 0 data.

Any idea how can i get my balance to show my actual coins? It seems like the wallet is up and running now..



edit; so it worked. i let the wallet sync with auto-selection... it took me 2 weeks. then you gotta reset the wallet. and the coins show up :)

So I am just putting up a post, active member do upvote this ,I guess it can save their time to see a less post daily.Although this is clearly mentioned on official site I find everyone gathering on reddit for help.
OK now, I don't know about Linux but I have used it in windows and its 100% foolproof.

##### For users who are lazy move to web wallet , as lot of work to do . I will keep it simple though#####

Note - Important - Make sure to have like 40-50 GB free space in the drive where app data will be saved or else you might get block load error.

Note- Don't send BCN to wallet before syncing it fully, many users reported coins went missing.

1.Download Internet Download Manager just for download speed, you can use whatever you got but use a good one.(A lot needed to be downloaded) 

2.Go to https://bytecoin.org/downloads 

3.At the top download wallet as per OS (As I guess it should be already on your PC as we are talking about sync problem) 

4.Scroll down to the download page, there is a column named Resources, Click on Blockchain for every platform there. 

https://imgur.com/a/kfqqb

5.From there download two files blocks.bin and block index.bin (nearly total 9 GB, might need a little bit time depending on your speed ) 

6.Again on the download page on the top there is an Instruction page .Click on that and read manual configuration
(I am stating in short, after download ,go to users&gt;Appdata&gt;Roaming&gt;bytecoin there you will find other two file with same name like you download.Replace them) 

7.Open bytecoin wallet and wait till it imports all data (it would take some time)and Done, whatever the download speed may be I guess in a day it will be done .No need for stucking like days.

Second Method

Few users and @bcn_official are talking about some remote daemon on bcnrps.ebrahma.com at port 8081 , something like that.I had never checked it out though, anyone can try.

Great , If anyone feel got rescued because of this then don't be happy donate some BCN below.Everyone is welcome for donation.

I’d like to make a clarification about the situation with the Lydian ICO and the ability to buy their tokens with Bytecoin.

It’s nice to know that Bytecoin is available as a method of purchasing ICO tokens, however, we don’t want to motivate anyone to participate in any crypto-related projects before doing their own analyse. The ICO market of 2017 has proven that there are a lot of projects which tend to be successful, as well as ICOs which have been developed as fraud. We like the idea that Bytecoin is available as a payment method for the token buyers, but you have to keep in mind that there are no guarantees in the crypto market, especially regarding ICOs.

Bytecoin is a decentralised network which operates on a path of active development and we’re glad that some ICO platforms have decided to add BCN as a method of purchasing certain tokens, because it’s a nice way to increase Bytecoin’s ecosystem and spread a word about us. But one has to pay attention and do their own research when investing in any project. Bytecoin is not responsible for any issues which may happen with the Lydian ICO, so one has to do their own research. 

As for the interview which is mentioned in their press-release, there was a typo, and now everything is fixed. As for me, I don’t want anyone from our community to participate in any initial coin offering before an audit and research. The operators from Lydian have already changed the mistake they posted in the article in a press-release, however, I just wanted to let you guys know about it. This is an essential thing, and one has to be responsible for their own words.

Cryptocurrency is on the path to becoming tomorrow’s alternative to fiat money, and that’s why it’s important to think every time you want to spend your cash somewhere so, please, be aware of the actions you take.

Cheers,

Stuffs I learnt.","Just wanted to say, I've really enjoyed my experience with getting on board with Bytecoin. The client software for Windows is well done. Granted it took me a few days to sync the wallet -- I'm on a 6Mbps internet connection -- but once done everything worked smoothly. I also played around with the command-line client, very easy to use as well. I like the fact that mining is pre-set up and it takes just one click to start. In the midst of watching and waiting for the blockchain to download, I looked into the optimal path for buying bytecoins with minimal fees, and ended up using gdax.com to buy bitcoins (also a first for me) and then hitbtc.com to exchange for bytecoins. The biggest pain in all of it was waiting for money from my initial bank transfer to show up in gdax -- took a solid 10 days. Also, not having any experience in any kind of trading, it took me awhile to understand the concept of market maker / taker. In short, if I understand right, if you successfully sell coins for at least slightly more than they're currently worth, you're helping the market -- i.e you're a market maker -- and because that makes exchanges like gdax happy, there's no fee. I lost $50 because I got caught up playing around with trading bitcoins back and forth in gdax prior to moving my BTC to hitbtc.com, but definitely worth what I learned and was very exciting -- I can see how easy it would be to get caught up in day trading! I could add a lot more detail, but just throwing this general info out there as an encouragement to anyone considering investing in some bytecoins... very worth everything I learned as a newbie about cryptocurrency in general!

Based on previous experiences shared through Reddit, I was a little hesitant to pull the trigger.  Thankfully, I didn’t have any issues and am proof that the function works.

While there is a 20 minute time limit for conducting the transaction, the confirmation time is not part of the 20 minutes.

My transaction was confirmed 9 times over the course of 30 minutes after I hit the send button and I was able to successfully add 40k BCN to my wallet via the web wallet’s ‘BUY BCN’ button.  

It’s not as easy as passing a $20 bill to your friend  - - it requires the usual gathering of addresses and correct amounts - - and as such, I suspect some buyers have had issues due to the less than user-friendly nature of crypto transactions but I’m here to tell you, it does work.

The only real downside is that I paid a higher premium for the BCN than I would’ve liked.  I pulled the trigger at ~$0.01024/BCN (coinmarketcap).  The final cost with fees averaged out to $0.011766/BCN.  The difference equates to a $60.68 premium on a $470.64 transaction - $16.59 in Coinbase fees and the rest I have no idea to where it went.  Regardless, the application worked well and now I’ve got 40k more than I had yesterday.

Hope this puts those on the fence a little more at ease with the web wallet buy button.  Come on in fellas, the waters fine!

P.S.

Now, what I’d really like to see is a cash out button on the web wallet... that’d be sweet!

And a Buy BCN with LTC

And a Buy BCN with ETH

And a Buy BCN with USD!

And lower transaction fees...

Hi, its same as equities have always been!!!","Being a veteran wall-street trader, it's just a trip to read all these articles on Forbes, etc... about the craziness of Crypto currencies.. how unstable they are, how tweets and news send them soaring or dropping.. massive selloffs, massive profits.. All in the context of saying how un-safe, and just gambling/wild west crypto's are..

This makes me part furious, part laugh.. furious because it makes it seem like Cryptos are some super new crazy thing, and they are a joke. Fact is, the articles that describe all the unstable craziness is the EXACT same thing most wall-street IPO's go through. SAME thing. Like word for word... Just because NYSE and NASDAQ listed equities have some more business justification to point to, some brick/mortar tangible assets, it's BS... Because stock value is still all sentiment, and very little of it rationale. 

I remember trading the day Google IPO'd..  Institutional investors bought in at something like 40 bucks.. When it opened to the public it was 90. Went to 150, down to 80, up to 100, etc.. and then over months stabilized, all fueled by tweets and other garbage. And that's nothing compared to other IPO's that went bust eventually.. Red Hat, Akamai technology, Rambus.... even companies like Research in Motion (RIMM) that founded the blackberry.. 50-100 point swings in  a day, all fueled by news, and crazy shit.. 

The only difference? To have access to trade those equities, you needed to be a licensed trader. You were trained, and used to seeing all these things, it was/is your job. With crypto's, any jerk with 20 bucks can get involved... and they think its insane, and they make all these statements.. comparing it to gambling, etc..  

All I can say to those people is ""Welcome! It's the exact same thing as any other equity investment. I promise. Nothing different or exceptional going on here.

May I check why 20 minutes limit is set for purchasing BCN with BTC in Bytecoin wallet?  I initiated 3 transactions, but only 1 transaction is completed, with the other 2 transactions failing for “timeout” issue.  

According to your public notice, we have to wait for 30 DAYS to get refund.  It is too long in crypto-coin world.

To boost BCN’s popularity, can you simply remove the 20 minutes limit or extend such limit?  Thanks.

Interestingly he picks bytecoin over other coins this made me happy  as he not only picked bytecoin but at least listened to me about Cryptos no one in my family ever cares and I always try to explain to them.

So I downloaded for him the desktop wallet and installed it, I then personally sent 1000 bcn to his address as any responsible grandson would do. I then told my friends about this and they got excited and asked for his address where they sent him some donations we jokingly called it
""LETS SUPPORT GRANDPA""

Some observations...

- CoinMarketCap is now the **most visited investment website in the world** and is still growing fast. [(Source)](https://www.similarweb.com/website/coinmarketcap.com#overview)

- Bytecoin is now the **24th ranked** coin in crypto by market cap on CMC.

- Bytecoin has a relatively small average daily trading volume—$44 million, compared to many top 25 coins trading $250M, $500M or even $1 billion per day.

- Bytecoin's Market Cap allow plenty of room for price growth— 5 cents would grow our investments 300% an put the market cap at $10B; 14 cents grows our investments 900% at a $25B market cap.

- Crypto is growing **fast**— Even with last night CMC glitch and subsequent noob panic sell, the market is growing at an incredible rate and that new money is likely to go to inexpensive coins in the top 50.

...

So let's do this!

- Who are the mods for reddit/Facebook/Twitter?

- Do we have a telegram site?

- How can we get listed on new exchanges? So we get more exposure and trading volume?

- How can we, as a community, support Bytecoin and help spread the word about it's value?

It's seems we're on the verge of a huge breakthrough... What can we do to make sure that happens?

There were some messages from users who were trying to buy Bytecoins with BTC and haven’t received BCN because of the pending timeout. I’d like to clarify this situation one more time.

20 minutes is a period of time when the BTC transaction has to appear on the network (not to be confirmed, but to be created). So the person who is willing to buy BCN with BTC has to pay the invoice within 20 minutes. While making the order, please, be sure that your BTC wallet is in your hand and you’re able to make a payment within the deadline. Please notice that it’s quite important to send your BTC from the external wallet like Blockchain.info but not from the exchange platforms. Only sending BTC from the external client will allow your funds go to the memory pool immediately. In other cases, your BCN won’t be deposited and you’ll be refunded with BTC in 30 days manually.

This measure was taken due to the current high volatility of cryptocurrencies and this period of time tends to minimise the risks of the extreme price fluctuations. In case you see that you aren’t able to pay the invoice within 20 minutes, please, cancel your order or make another one to make sure you’re able to make a payment in the mentioned time limit. 

One more thing I want to mention is that everyone who’s working with cryptocurrency or just getting involved shouldn’t be distracted. Remember that these are your investments, so please, take it seriously.

**Note: This guide only applies to Windows users whose beta wallet is fully synced with the blockchain.**
*****
Let’s start this post with a question: Why did I create this post?
 
The new beta wallet, it turns out, allows you to add mining pools to your wallet, but it doesn’t allow you to remove them. 

If you accidentally make a mistake while entering a new mining host in your wallet, or you just don’t like a host that requires you to mine a lot of Bytecoin before it pays out, this can be a pain.
 
Fortunately enough, it’s very easy to manually edit the mining pool list in your wallet.
 
To do this, you’ll first want to search for a file called **%appdata%**, which should be at the following path **C:\Users\YourUsername \AppData**. 

There, you’ll want to double click the **bytecoin folder**, and in the folder, you’ll want to locate a file called **bytecoin-gui.config**. 

After you **right click** the **bytecoin-gui.config** file, you want to select **open with** and then select **notepad**. The contents of that folder should look like this: 

    {
        ""connectionMethod"": 0,
        ""miningCpuCoreCount"": 2,
        ""miningPoolList"": [
            ""bytecoin.uk:3333"",
            ""bytecoin-pool.org:3333""
        ],
        ""miningPoolSwitchStrategy"": 0,
        ""recentWallets"": [
            ""127.0.0.1:8070""
        ],
        ""remoteRpcEndPoint"": ""127.0.0.1:8070"",
        ""walletFile"": ""C:/Users/YourUsername /Desktop/BCN.wallet""
    }

In the section called **miningPoolList**, find the mining host you would like to delete and delete it. 

So, if I wanted to remove the bytecoin-pool.org pool from my wallet, for example, my new **bytecoin-gui.config** file would look like this: 

      {
             ""connectionMethod"": 0,
             ""miningCpuCoreCount"": 2,
             ""miningPoolList"": [
                 ""bytecoin.uk:3333""
             ],
             ""miningPoolSwitchStrategy"": 0,
             ""recentWallets"": [
                 ""127.0.0.1:8070""
             ],
             ""remoteRpcEndPoint"": ""127.0.0.1:8070"",
             ""walletFile"": ""C:/Users/YourUsername /Desktop/BCN.wallet""
         }

After you save this file and restart your beta wallet, you’ll notice that the mining pool you deleted should be gone!

I’d like to make a statement to those who requested a refund in BTC during the “buy button” issues.

During the refund process there appeared to be a few unpredictable system issues with the BTC refund and unfortunately we have to postpone the process for 1 more month.

We do apologize for this inconvenience and promise that everyone who is expecting their refund in BTC will certainly receive it. Please be patient with us as we attempt to get this issue solved.

Thank you for your understanding.

For any complaints or suggestions please write to contact@bytecoin.org or via telegram to @BCN_official 

All the best,

When I received your email reply regarding us getting our refund I was glad to see you guys took the time to get back to us. When asked if I wanted to be refunded BCN or BTC  I clearly stated that I wanted my BTC back and included all the info you asked of me to make it happen. I was eagerly waiting to receive my BTC back. 

After waiting a good while I checked back on this reddit and saw you said that you had refunded everyone back. Wondering why I had no BTC deposit refund in my Coinbase account yet (which is what I asked for) I decided to check out my BCN web wallet and saw that I had received my BCN in there from the failed transaction but that is not what I had asked for. I have emailed you and would like a solution for this problem.

Due to this attack, we decided to do an emergency upgrade to allow better protection against such attacks, which is why we had brief downtime on Friday. However, during the migration it seems there was a hiccup in our database which caused pending payments to clear and anyone with less than 50 BCN had their pending payments wiped. The total payments wiped was equal to about 2000 BCN, and I can assure you that I am not running away with 2000 BCN in some kind of scam. The pool is legitimate and my motives have always been to better the community. I have database backups, but since I just realized the issue, people have now accumulated an additional balance. I am looking into how I can append previous payments so everyone is paid back what they earned, but I am not sure how best to approach this. I promise you all that I will work something out and that Bytecoin Party and SevenDoorknobs are here to stay. I will keep you all updated as we move forward.

Dear Community, 

Today I received a screenshot from one of our community members about some scammer activity.   

It showed that another telegram account had been created that claimed that they were a part of our support team!

(Take a look at the screenshot) Where the name of the account looks like mine but there's a space after ""underline"" and before ""official"", that makes him different compared to my account.  

❗️ I'm the only official representative of the Bytecoin team. ❗️

If you are not sure that you are talking exactly with the original Bytecoin account, please check the status in the admin panel of the telegram group.  

 ⚠️I'll never ask for your email if you not writing me about your web wallet problems.

* Nice UI
* inbuilt  mining - Click and start mining
* Add contacts - Manage contact
* Console - Can view all the logs

Bad :

* When opened the wallet. header(wallet,help) was not visible i had to minimize the wallet and drag it down.

Bytecoin needs to get more on the markets so its sold more, poloneix does not work, bitrex their reviews are amazingly bad, this automatically makes bytecoin stuck with poloneix, and then when you go to poloneix they don't accept bytecoin payments.  
  
We are basically stuck, now you guys added bytecoin on changelly and have you read their reddit posts? lost transactions, no support nothing...  
  
The sites bytecoin is currently on isn't even marketing the coin this giving us less exposure...  
  
I would recommend the developers or whatever takes care of the market requests to look into evercoin as they are also another currency exchange like changelly but their support and reviews are 100% better, changelly i had used in the past but now they seem to go down hill...  
  
EDIT: changelly - i have 0.1 monero i want to exchange into 5k bytecoin, last week their minimum requirement was 0.102 now its 0.12 i'm not a hardcore miner who has 5k hashrate or something they basically ignore their main purpose of their website, ""fast exchange market""",NA,"80y8m2",NA,0,NA,"false",1520610354,"false","self","t5_31ues","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/BytecoinBCN/comments/80y8m2/why_we_are_stuck_in_quick_sand/",NA,"",NA,"","",0,0

This morning, I sent 1 Bytecoin from my beta desktop wallet to my online wallet, and everything went very, very smoothly. 

After that, I sent 1 Bytecoin from my online wallet to my beta desktop wallet, and I had no issues whatsoever. 

As a matter of fact, the transactions appeared almost immediately, albeit in an unconfirmed status, and they only took about a minute to become spendable (i.e., to be confirmed). 

So far, I'm very impressed with Bytecoin!

As the title suggests, I made this tool that ranks the most secure and private email, backup, VPN, cryptos and communication software :)

It's all based on a Google Sheet, which updates the website automatically when the spreadsheet changes: https://secured.fyi/edit

Couldn’t find a good comparison overview like this, and want to see if enough people are interested in it, because I would like to spend more time on expanding the data set, and add more categories.

I wrote a medium post here that goes more in detail on how and why it was made: https://medium.com/@fredrikaurdal/secured-fyi-ranking-the-most-secure-and-private-software-tools-how-i-created-a-powerful-ranking-1f8a37913169

Currently, Bytecoin is ranking #1, but if there are compelling arguments making the ranking stronger, and the community supports it, changes will be made. And also, I might add a some kind of overview that shows users features in the roadmap somehow.

# Some background
I have been working on getting a good Mobile Miner for the past few months. If you have ever used any of the apps available right now you will understand why I set out to do this. Either the apps are super scamy [Crypto Miner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miner&amp;hl=en), or they both skim your hashrate and only allow you to mine to their pool [MinerGate](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.minergate.miner&amp;hl=en). 


I have posted here several times, with the software getting progressivly better!

[First Version] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7kbrjl/xmr_miner_for_android_arm_x64_using_wolfxmrminer/)

[Second Version](https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneroMining/comments/7qcu93/mining_on_android_64_bit_or_32_bitxmrig/)


However over the past month or so I have been working on turning this into a real android app, and it has genuinely become the best software available for Android Devices. Period.

# A link to the apk
[GitHub](https://github.com/NanoBytesInc/Pickaxe)


# Features

* The fastest mining on the market (by roughly %20 on high end phones when compared to MinerGate)
* **It has an OLED friendly mode**
* **Allows you to enter your wallet address from a QR code**
* Allows you to mine to which ever pool you want to (again, being compared to MinerGate)
* Can mine any CryptoNight coin, but has built in support for Monero, Electroneum, Aeon, Sumokoin, and Bytecoin pools.
* Saves your configurations so they do not need to constantly be re-entered
* **VERY Stable** (my 5 Android devices have been running for over a week, 24/7 without a problem)
* Works with the screen off
* Clean interface
* **Shows an estimated progress in the current share**
* You can un-tick the donation option (though, you could also not ;D )
* **Shows your current balance for the pool you are mining to** (Supports +10 pools across the 5 coins, including supportxmr.com) 

**You will not get a better hash rate anywhere else.** I have compiled the binaries for each individual CPU architecture (x86, x64, and i686), so you are getting 100% of the hash power available to your device. This is opposed to what MinerGate does, which relies heavily on software implementations, reducing the hash rate of your device by nearly 20%. I know I am ragging on them a little bit, but they ""have the mobile market"" right now, and they don't deserve it.

I will be releasing the source code for the app as soon as I am able to get the app placed on the app store (I don't want it getting sniped by someone else before I can). That should be coming really soon! 

But, if you don't trust this (which you honestly shouldn't) you can use the binaries which this app is wrapping around, as I did release the source code for them :)

then i tryed bytecoin clones, such as monero, but it was very shoddy (the window randomly jumped on my screen when i tried to move it around, and it wasnt able to connect to ,,himself'' so i ended up deleting that as well).

It took me several days to learn this information through trial and error. Using information in this post, however, you should be able to start using cryptocurrency in less than a day. Specifically, I will discuss three things you must do to started, namely: 

1. Downloading a compatible wallet;
2. Creating a .wallet file and syncing the wallet with the blockchain; and 
3. Getting Bytecoin by mining for it or purchasing it from someone who already has it. 

In all honesty, these are the very basics of cryptocurrency, and you can apply the steps to almost any other currency, including Bitcoin. Similarly, I could write an entire post on how to configure your computer, so you reap the most amount of profits on Bytecoin UK, for example, but that is just beyond the scope of this post.

------------------------------------------------------**Getting a Wallet**----------------------------------------

The most secure way to store your Bytecoin is by installing a wallet, which is nothing more than a program that allows you to send and receive Bytecoin as well as mine for Bytecoin, on your laptop or desktop. 

The best way to acquire the wallet is to visit the developer of  Bytecoin’s website (i.e., https://bytecoin.org/downloads) and download it. Since Bytecoin is constantly being improved, I would recommend that you download the Beta version of the desktop wallet. Having just installed it myself, I know it's working just fine. 

Once you download it, you will want to install it, and at this point, your anti-virus software may flag it as a virus, but it isn’t. It is 100% safe. 

Next, you’ll want to create your wallet, which will require you to set a password. At the top of your wallet, click wallet and then create wallet, which should prompt you to enter a password. In creating a wallet, you'll notice that your wallet creates a .wallet file; you will want to save this somewhere safe, since it contains all of the information about your wallet. In other words, this is the file you can open to view your account. 

As soon as you create the wallet, your wallet will begin synchronizing with the blockchain, which is a ledger of all of the transactions that have taken place with Bytecoin.   

Depending on how fast your internet connect is, this process will take approximately 3 to 8 hours to complete, and it will take up a lot of your computer's resources, particularly its hard drive. This is completely normal, and once you go through this, you won’t have to do it again. 

As soon as your wallet synchronizes with the blockchain, you will be ready to start sending and receiving Bytecoin. Similarly, if you do not sync your wallet with the blockchain, you will not able to send or receive Bytecoin!

Your Bytecoin address, which is the address at which you can receive funds from other people, is the long string of random characters toward the top of your wallet. If you click on it, it will automatically be copied to your clipboard. 

Now, you’re ready to start sending and receiving Bytecoin and as well as mining for Bytecoin.

------------------------------------------------**Acquiring Bytecoin**--------------------------------------------

While there are several ways to acquire Bytecoin, I will discuss the two most reliable methods here. In essence, you can either use your computer to mine for Bytecoin, or you can purchase Bytecoin directly from someone who has Bytecoin already. 

-------------------------------------------**MinerGate**--------------------------------------------------------- 

As for using your computer to mine for Bytecoin, I would recommend creating an account on MinerGate.com and downloading its mining software. As was the case for your Bytecoin wallet, your anti-virus may recognize the software as a virus, but it’s not. 

Once you load the software, you simply put in same e-mail address you used to create the account on MinerGate.com and start mining. 

As far as CPU mining goes, you will want to use less CPU power than you computer currently has available. For example, my processor has six cores, so I typically only use 5 cores to mine. If you only have a dual-core processor, I would recommend you only use one of the cores to mine. Otherwise, you can cause your machine to overheat. 

To monitor my system, including its core and GPU temperature, I use Open Hardware Monitor (i.e., http://openhardwaremonitor.org/) 

As soon as you mine 100 Bytecoins, you can then transfer them directly to your wallet. Note: If you are only using a limited amount of your computer’s resources, this can take as long as one month, and there are calculators on MinerGate.com that will help you determine how long it should take.

--------------------------------------------------**Bytecoin UK**------------------------------------------------


If you want to start earning Bytecoin within a few hours, you can also mine on the Bytecoin UK pool (i.e., https://bytecoin.uk/#getting_started). 

On its website, you can download a miner that has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and see the commands you need to use other mining software. For example, I use Claymore's CPU miner, so I enter the following commands in command prompt: 

NsCpuCNMiner64 -o stratum+tcp://bytecoin.uk:3333 -u YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS -p x

By entering your wallet ID on its website, you can check your mining statistics and payment history. 
In addition, you can also configure it so that you will receive payouts for every 5 BCN you mine. **Note: MinerGate requires you to mine 100 BCN before you can transfer the BCN to your wallet, whereas Bytecoin UK only requires you to mine 5 BCN for a payout.**


----------------------------------------------------------**eBay**-----------------------------------------------

If you don’t want to use your computer’s resources to mine Bytecoin, you can also purchase it directly from a seller. 

In my experience, the most reliable way to buy Bytecoin is through eBay. There, you simply purchase Bytecoin from a seller who usually lists the methods by which he or she is willing to accept payment in the description of the post. 

Typically, a seller will ask you to send your payment, as well as your Bytecoin address, to them via a message on PayPal. 

As long as you send small amounts, your risk of being scammed is minimal, and personally, I have never been scammed this way. 

So that’s it. Now, you’re ready to start using Bytecoin!

I am ready to give access to the server bytecoins.world FOR ANY OFFICIAL PRESON OF BYTECOIN to prove my clear hands. 

Bytecoins.World completely open and clean honest project.
It born to spread word about bytecoins, and make bytecoins usability most simple for every developer.
Thats why I am start public node, widgets, start develop json api, create free faucet and lottery.
I have plans to make other useful services.
But I need little monetization , for server rent and faucet (because donates don`t work). Thats why I am create lottery..

Want to say, that situation with Wolgadeutsch that was a bag. Only error. Other users during 2 weeks - have possibility to use FAUCET and withdraw 0.2bcn every 5 mins
and can use lottery and deposit / withdraw BCN...

This situation with error, was because it`s was bug with bytecoin wallet synchronization.
I recently open github issue 
https://github.com/bcndev/bytecoin/issues/26

firstly I am note that bug on my PC, and after - on the server..

Problem was solved after resynchronization.. Now all work fine.
I sent BCN back to  Wolgadeutsch 
https://prnt.sc/ipfizj


Peace everybody and have great weekend. :)
glad to meet you here
https://bytecoins.world/



P.S: For the Future I want to ask BCN_official to add this resource to their website to Community section. So that there are no such problems like that.


And all the bugs and errors will fixed ASAP on bytecoins.world as bcndev will do it.

If you have problems - just write to support, and we will resolve it. But don`t scream scam.

It`s development stage. Thank you.

P.P.S: I found the bug, it was on my side - http://prntscr.com/iphy6c  . 
I thought there is more problems on my code like that, but that`s not reason to make that noise - scam scam.
I hope you will treat yourself with understanding.","","83ie3x",NA,0,NA,"false",1522285546,"false","self","t5_31ues","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/BytecoinBCN/comments/83ie3x/bytecoinsworld_isnt_scam/","","",NA,"","",0,0

# What's Next?

Geeze dude! We just released version 8.0! Give us a break!

Just kidding!

If you've been an active member in our community, you know that the work never stops! We're constantly rolling out new updates and features to AIOMiner to bring a better and more successful mining experience to our users. So, next thing we're working on is further development of AIOMiner.com. We want the website to complement and integrate with the AIOMiner software. This way you'll be able to monitor any and all of your rigs anywhere you have an internet connection! 

We're also going to be working on deep analytics into your rig(s) so that you can manipulate them yourself to align with your mining goals whether that be profit, coin accumulation, simply supporting the projects that you believe in, or anything else mining related.

Something already in the works and getting very close to launch is the AIOPool, but that's all I'm going to say about that! You'll have to stay tuned for more! (Sign up for our newsletter on the website)

# Help Wanted

All this time, we've been a small team of miners making a better mining experience. As we grow, we're going to need more help! If you're interested in working on a project like AIOMiner, come by our discord and let us know! We'll be happy to evaluate your credentials and see if there's a need on our team that you can fill!

We all work remotely, so location doesn't matter, but we highly prefer that you are located in the United States.

Bytecoin has so much potential to be a valued coin and to gain a large following, but honestly I feel like the marketing team or whoever is in charge of communicating with companies and exchanges/etc. is not doing their job properly. BCN has been around for over 6 years and they are barely on any exchanges at all while there are other coins that are new and have billions of coins in supply and are on dozens of markets already. I feel that Bytecoin would be well over 0.02 or even 0.05+ if the people in charge of marketing would try harder to get the word out about their coin and try to build a better community. I keep hearing from the team that they are doing this, but so far nothing has happened.
Ripple is a good example of a coin that was under a penny for 5 ENTIRE YEARS before it went up drastically and hit a dollar and beyond, and considering XRP (Ripple) has a max. supply of 100B coins and BCN has 184B it doesn't seem that hard to see it shoot up in value the same way in the future. BCN has a lot to offer with privacy and its ability to be untraceable, but to be honest 
it is absolutely unbelievable in my opinion that Bytecoin has been around for half a decade and the BCN team hasn't done enough to get it's own coin into many of the large exchanges and other small exchanges. This should be one of their top priorities to get exposure and to have cash flow for their coin. I know that the team has a roadmap set up for 2018 to expand into many markets and hopefully they actually succeed and do their job properly and in return will reward the community by having the coin increase in value and become more recognized and used in the cryptoworld. There is definitely not enough advertising or exposure for BCN to become a respectable coin especially with all the scam rumors and overall sketchiness of the team not being open about their identities etc. Hopefully things will change by the end of 2018. Goodluck to all who believe in BCN guys, hopefully we will all be rewarded in the  near future.

This is litterly the first time I am posting about it to see how people would react to such a system. Currently, it is able to find arbitrage opportunities between **Binance** **Bittrex** **Bitfinex** **HitBTC** **OKEx** **Poloniex** **Kraken** **HitBTC** **Huobi** **BitStamp** **GDAX** and **Bit-Z**.

It's not like the average arbitrage bots, mine works by not only calculating the profit from buying on one exchange and selling on the other, but also considers things like trading volume to filter out poor options, so you don't waste your time on an arbitrage opportunity that only works with 10$ before the prices begin to converge. If you've made it this far, know that Bytecoin is trading 20% higher on HitBTC than Poloniex right now.

My system is designed to eliminate trading risk by keeping your money out of the market for as long as possible. The purpose is to detect when there is a large price gap between exchanges and capitalize off it, which means you get in and out as fast as possible. The only risk is the time it takes to transfer from one exchange to another, but the ERC20 tokens transfer pretty fast, so it works well with most digital currencies.

I would like to see how many people were able to successfully profit from arbitrage, also who would be interested in such a system. Especially now that bytecoin is so fast, it is really not as risky as other coins. Right now there are opportunities for 20% gains.

The app is called ""CryptArbitrage"" on the Google Play Store, I'm keeping it free and adless for you guys. --------TRY IT OUT-----------------

BLUF: I have found that both the web wallet and the beta wallet work very well for transferring BCN back and forth.

I downloaded the beta wallet about a month ago but have been hesitant to transfer my BCN from the web wallet as it has been working very well for me, for both purchasing and for storing BCN.

Yesterday, I was able to quickly transfer 5K BCN from my web wallet to my beta wallet in a matter of seconds.  The confirmation took roughly 30 seconds to fully complete.  I did this 9 times (5K each) before transferring my remaining million BCN in one transaction, which went through without a hitch.  In addition, I transferred 10 BCN from the beta wallet to the web wallet and back again without any issues.  All of these transactions cost 1/100 of a BCN each and each Tx completed under a minute.

While others may have had issues, to this point, I have not had any issues.  The technology is solid and I continue to be a BCN fan.

Great job to the dev team for continuing to make improvements on this awesome crypto!","","85e3ra",NA,0,NA,"false",1522321754,"false","self","t5_31ues","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/BytecoinBCN/comments/85e3ra/review_bcn_beta_wallet_and_bcn_web_wallet/","","",NA,"","",0,0

Welcome to our first AMA with the Bytecoin Dev Team. Today the topic of our AMA will be focused on the upcoming hardfork (June 12th) and the new Github (https://github.com/bcndev). We plan to conduct the AMA for 90 minutes, 5:30PM - 7:00PM GMT +1. Please keep questions focused on these topics as other questions/comments will be removed or answered at a later date.

Below you can see a list of rules which we will use to moderate this thread so please read them carefully before commenting!

About the AMA rules:

We are happy to answer any and all topic related questions.
Please keep comments civil and polite.
All initial responses to posters must contain a properly punctuated question.

Questions which will not be addressed in this AMA:
Tech support or account issue related questions, for help with that please email us at Contact@bytecoin.org or on Telegram at bcn_official
Aggressive or non topic posts will be removed by the moderator. 

 Comments will be removed under a few circumstances:
1.   Abusive or harassing comments
2. Comments where there would be no possibility of a real answer, especially where it is deliberately creepy or offensive.
3.   ""I bet OP won't answer this""-type responses, which usually come after the OP has finished responding to questions.
4.   Repeatedly asking the same question, which violates Reddit's site-wide rules.
5.   A subreddit or other website organizing and voting for a group comment/question is considered to be vote cheating and is subject to removal. It is a violation of the rules of reddit and risks a sitewide ban.
6. Questions must be directed toward the individual(s) doing the IAMA.
7. Under our policies, astroturfing is the practice of an individual or group of individuals who plant questions in an AMA post for a particular purpose. Behavior of this kind will result in a permanent ban from /r/BytecoinBCN/

Hello Everybody!
Our AMA has come to an end. We are locking the thread for now but we will try to sort through the questions and respond to anything that we don’t feel we have addressed yet.
Thank you everybody for helping make our first AMA the best it can be!
We look forward to having more AMAs like this in the future!

All the best,
The Bytecoin Team

List of recommended Wallets from bytecoin.uk:

New Desktop Wallet Beta Version - Seem to work, remember this is a beta version.

Cryptonator - Works very well(minimium payout required 10 BCN)

Freewallet - Works well, can have sometimes maintenances.


List of not recommended Wallets:

Old version of the desktop wallet - not receiving all transactions with remode node, a workaround is to use Auto Selection to sync with the entire blockchain and use ""Reset Wallet"" function to retrieve missing payments. More informations here: Fix Bytecoin Desktop Wallet

Poloniex - you WILL NOT receive any transactions because the pool can NOT know your Payment ID - DO NOT USE Poloniex wallets!

Paper Wallet - not receiving all transactions.

Bytecoin Ninja - DO NOT USE IT, every node and peer and paper wallet are dead.","","83rb17",NA,0,NA,"false",1522290725,"false","self","t5_31ues","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/BytecoinBCN/comments/83rb17/bytecoinuk_list_of_recommended_wallets/","","",NA,"","",0,0

I’d like to announce that we have finally made the last part of the “buy button” refund to those people who have been waiting for their refund in BTC.

Due to unsolved technical issues from a third party we have deposited to all of those accounts with BCN.

Please check your BCN address from where the purchase was made. The refund was made according to the actual market price.

I want to express my sincerest apologies for such long delay. 

From this moment the “Buy Button” refund issue has officially been closed.

-Jenny

My BTC has been stuck now for over 2 months. Sent over 5 emails to support yet only one reply from contact@bytecoin which told me that a BTC refund was an option but now I’ve heard nothing for over a month.

I’ve had reassurances that this would be solved but now haven’t heard anything for absolutely ages. Is anyone else still in this situation? Is there anything I can do to get this solved?

I mine it and since I don't have my own data center and because mining only yields so many coins..I buy it.

And here is the problem.

The ONLY place where you can get BCN is HitBtc.

And it's a friggin nightmare.

Transferring USD to coinbase = 20 minutes.
Buying BTC on coinabse = 5 seconds.
Withdrawing BTC to hardware wallet from coinbase  = 5-25 minutes.
Sending BTC to hitBtc trading account = 5-25 minutes

Buying BCN using bitcoin on hitBtc = 5 seconds.

Withdrawing your BCN from HitBtc to your desktop??

Holy crap...7 hours and still it didn't even initiate after I clicked on the confirmation link.

I keep having to post on the hitBtc Reddit forums every time I make a withdrawal.

I mean wtf? Isn't there a better way? A more responsive exchange?

Thank you so much for participating in the Bytecoin Ask Me Anything Event this past Tuesday.
After reading over 70+ questions, I was sure of one thing- Bytecoin community truly cares and believes in the World's First Anonymous and Untraceable Currency.

I waited for all of the questions to be submitted and have gathered all of the info from the Q&amp;A on the Reddit Page:
https://www.reddit.com/r/BytecoinBCN/comments/845hmk/we_are_the_bytecoin_dev_team_and_we_are_here_to


Here are the links to the SummarY:
Part 1: https://youtu.be/zdsyOh83Eww
Part 2: https://youtu.be/r1r8q4mNK4I


Here are a couple of questions that I did not find a direct answer to in the thread:

1. When can we expect the anon tokens to be picked up again and included in the roadmap?
(If this was referring to the untraceable tokens, that question has been answered)
2. Will you do a reverse split?
(My guess is- this was referring to a combining of BCN and another token- and as I believe the team had mentioned- no plan to change supply.)
3. What's happening with DStrange? Did he got bored with Bytecoin? He was quite good as community person.



There were also a couple of questions that were redundant in the sense of new info- so I have set them aside, and selected a similar, more inclusive, question.

1. Is the hard fork just a new better wallet? Not a new token
2. What exactly will consist of the hard fork? 
3. What is real purpose of hardfork? I mean, we are going to watch how a new coin is going to be born, or you are going to increase or decrease emission?
4. What will be in detail the improvements after the hard fork?
5. When will you realize Atomic Swap technology in bytecoin?


Do feel free to share any new piece of information that I might have missed.

Almost all the users want to resist blockchain analysis. When a cryptocurrency transaction happen both the sender’s and receiver’s public addresses are stored in the blockchain as a part of transaction, even with the amount of cryptocurrency sent.
	If someone know people’s public addresses, they can track the transaction details such as how much cryptocurrency getting and how many transaction performed.
Bytecoin arrives with a solution for it,
	In order to avoid the openness of transaction Bytecoin introduces 
Ring  signature algorithm which is also called CryptoNote.

Analysts of transaction and the blockchain would be unable to precisely pinpoint the members involved in a transaction. Ring signature shared by multiple users. If someone try to know about the transaction, they can recognize which group of users made a transaction but they can never track which individual user in the group performed the transaction.

I'll start off by admitting that I am a hobby miner and I don't have a lot of experience yet with mining crypto's.

I wanted to mine something with less difficulty than Monero. Did some research, found Bytecoin! I saw there were some issues in the past but I feel the future is bright for this coin. 

Started mining on 2 cores on a laptop that I installed the desktop wallet to and put my desktop to work over night using awesome miner. I got home to find out my wallet was empty still. Did some more research, saw that I could change nodes or download blockchain as a possible solution. But no avail. For what it matters my wallet says synched! 

I still wanted to mine Bytecoin, so I tried to setup a web wallet this morning and that is when I saw that it was in ""safe mode."" I went to read more... I see that ""Your funds are safe and will return as the infrastructure is repaired."" I don't know what to make of this when there was a new desktop wallet build about four or five days ago. 

Can anyone elaborate please?

The Bytecoin team has a very important topic to discuss with you.


A couple of months have past since the last official [mention](https://bytecoin.org/blog/untraceable-tokens-and-proof-of-concept) about untraceable tokens. The main point of the discussion was the consensus which has to be taken as a basic approach on the realisation of the tech. And we’re happy to announce that we’ve finally found a path which has successfully gone through the PoC. We’re still considering untraceable tokens as a technology which is able to make a breakthrough among the crypto community.


Well, to make this feature live, we need some resources. Firstly, we need about a year of active development to help make the technology run smoothly and be user-friendly, so anyone who’s willing to launch his own ICO will be able to do it with ease. Secondly, we’ll also need to involve more truly genius people to the project. Moreover, such a development needs a certain amount of finances to build it. In this case, we’ll need to start our own ICO to raise the capital. The capital we’ll raise will support the development of the technology that the crypto community really needs. 


We’re looking forward to getting your reply and opening this to further discussion.


Yours truly, 

Jenny and the Dev Team","","86ouzj",NA,0,NA,"false",1522347672,"false","self","t5_31ues","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/BytecoinBCN/comments/86ouzj/untraceable_tokens_topic_to_be_discussed/","","",NA,"","",0,0

____________________
""Good day friends. 
In regards to BCN mining difficulting increasing.

There is little to no discussion on reddit about ASIC miners possibly being on the Bytecoin Network.
So I thought I'd do a little of my own investigation by comparing the Monero difficulty chart to Bytecoins difficulty chart

Just to clarify to others. Bitman developed an ASIC miner for cryptonote coins thats capable of significantly outperforming GPU miners. In a sense, these supercomputers are so powerful that whoever owns a farm of them can essentially centralize the network. These supercomputer working together increase the difficulty of BCN mining by so much that GPU miners rewards become so small that they cant possibly compete with these other computers.
Without going further in depth. The Monero community saw this as a threat to their network and performed an ""emergency fork"" that changed Moneros algorithm making ASIC computers completely obsolete to mining Monero, keeping the network decentralized amongst its community

Awesome great job Monero! But now this super farm is just a multi-million dollar paper weight. So whats the next most promising cryptonote coin? Bytecoin!

Cryptocompare wont let me post pictures so check out this links comparing Monero mining difficulty chart to Bytecoins mining difficulty chart. This is my proof to myself that ASICs are on the Bytecoin Network

How can I raise the minimum to something higher?  I know it can be done because on the payments tab is shows people being paid out 300, 400, 1000 etc and there are very few 50 BCN payments.

Also, I'm using an Intel i7-4770 @ 3.4GHz and my hashrate is around 175-190 with occasional peaks as high as ~205H/s.  On a good day I'm able to mine 50 BCN in ~24 hours but sometimes it takes me as long as ~40 hours to mine 50.  My hashrate hasn't changed and the time between blocks being found is about the same as are the amount of users.  Why?

One more question:  I was using Minergate for a couple months before I ditched them and installed XMRig and began mining using bytecon.party's pool.  Despite the fact that Minergate's BCN pool was well over 1MH/s I was only able to get 20 BCN every ~48 hours compared to the much lower ~240KH/s of bytecoin.party's pool.  Why was I getting much less coins on Minergate (reported hashrate on Minergate was the same speeds I mentioned earlier; ~170-190H/s with peaks as high as ~205.

I know this is a lot of questions but I thank anyone in advance who can enlighten me.

Hello Bytecoiners!

Here are the rules for our upcoming second AMA with the Bytecoin Dev Team and the BCN Community in Korea!
The topic for this AMA will be focused on the Asian Market Expansion and the ASIC Mining Situation. We plan to conduct the AMA for 90 minutes, 7:00PM - 8:30PM GMT +9 on April 26th. Please keep questions focused on these topics as other questions/comments will be removed or answered at a later date.

Please note that this is our first bilingual AMA, all questions in English will be answered directly by BCN_official in English, all questions in Korean will be answered in Korean by our community representatives - blackijin and lindox1020.

Below you can see a list of rules which we will use to moderate this thread so please read them carefully before commenting!


AMA Rules:

We are happy to answer any and all topic related questions. Please keep comments civil and polite. All initial responses to posters must contain a properly punctuated question.
Questions which will not be addressed in this AMA: Tech support or account issue related questions, for help with that please email us at Contact@bytecoin.org or on Telegram at bcn_official. Aggressive or non topic posts will be removed by the moderator.

Comments will be removed under a few circumstances: 

1. Abusive or harassing comments 

2. Comments where there would be no possibility of a real answer, especially where it is deliberately creepy or offensive. 

3. ""I bet OP won't answer this""-type responses, which usually come after the OP has finished responding to questions. 

4. Repeatedly asking the same question, which violates Reddit's site-wide rules. 

5. A subreddit or other website organizing and voting for a group comment/question is considered to be vote cheating and is subject to removal. It is a violation of the rules of reddit and risks a sitewide ban. 

6. Questions must be directed toward the individual(s) doing the IAMA.
 
7. Under our policies, astroturfing is the practice of an individual or group of individuals who plant questions in an AMA post for a particular purpose. Behavior of this kind will result in a permanent ban from /r/BytecoinBCN/

All the best, 

The Bytecoin Team

바이트코인 사용자 여러분 안녕하세요?

바이트코인 개발팀과 한국 바이트코인 커뮤니티와 내일 AMA가 있을 예정입니다. AMA에서 지켜야 할 규칙을 공지합니다. 
이번 AMA의 주제는 아시아 시장확장 및 ASIC 채굴상황에 초점을 맞출 것입니다. AMA는 90분간 한국시 기준 7시~8시반까지 4월 26일에 진행합니다. 해당 주제에 초점을 맞추어 질문해 주시고, 주제에 벗어난 질의 및 코멘트는 AMA 다음날 삭제하거나 혹은 사안에 따라 대답해드릴 예정입니다. 


또한 금번 AMA는 영어와 한국어 두 언어로 진행합니다. 영어로 한 질문은 영어로 바이트코인팀(BCN_official)이 직접 답변할 것이며, 한국어 질문은 바이트코인 한국커뮤니티 대표인 빅토리아와 린독스(blackijin 혹은 lindox1020)님이 답할 예정입니다. 
아래와 같이 지켜야 할 규칙을 안내해 드리오니, AMA에서 질문이나 코멘트를 하기 전에 참조하여 주시면 감사하겠습니다.

The blog mentions that another problem could arise with non-centralized exchanges that use offline trading services, “as they cannot even stop attackers from laundering their tokens.”

1 the amount of BCN has become a lot smaller, burned down about 80% if you don't believe me, you need a calculator! Open poloniex and sum up all the sell orders.
(poloniex has lost access to the bytecoin coin, and will never be able to get back!)

2 poloniex is busy reducing the bytecoin exchange rate, and maintaining the BCN at a low level, (because poloniex cannot return Bytecoin, only returns conversion to another currency) otherwise poloniex will receive lawsuits in court! (proof: there are fake sell orders up to 1BCN=5000 BTC!!! 

3 who is on duty BCN lives in the US must attack poloniex a) appeal to the police and the court with the requirement to oblige to return BCN from poloniex
(b) the requirement to remove false BCN sales orders! This will remove the wall for the growth of BCN. Poloniex cannot sell what he does not! 
c) publicity that poloniex lost BCN! Require a refund only BCN, it will be the pressure on poloniex to force it to buy on external exchanges that would return
(d) maximum repost!!! Towards the moon )))

4 If the BCN is not official in collusion with polonieks they should force them to make a public announcement of the loss of Bytecoin
The methods are different, legitimate threat of prosecution, the threat of bankruptcy, the threat to unite the community against the BCN Polonik,
 and illegal: all kinds of attacks...

5 strategy:for poloniex to make it hard to buy Bytecoin to Keep up! poloniex will have to buy back at the rate of hundreds of times greater than 0,00000030! for calculation. Remember that poloniex is an enemy! Remember poloniex burned 80% BCN and now the path to the moon is open. Other exchanges should be aware that the poloniex exchange rate is not valid and do not pay attention to poloniex! On poloniex it is not possible to input the BCN output!
 
My four questions to BCN_official
1 did you know about burned on poloniex BCN or just guessed? 
2 Hardfork (12in) associated with the return of lost 80% BCN poloniex?
3 You and poloniex has signed a formal agreement to add BCN pad polonecks? 
4 if not concluded, then how do you explain the appearance on the site poloniex BCN? 
 Four specific questions! I want to get 4 specific answer!

In that low time for crypto, bytecoins.world has good news every day. So to follow it you need check our twitter https://twitter.com/BytecoinsWorld .

What is the new on the project from my last post and that scream that ""we are scam"":
- bytecoins.world will be added to bytecoin.org - and its just a matter of time - and here why:

1. Now we have own full public json API - https://api.bytecoins.world/status.json
1.2. Because of we have own public node - http://amsterdam.bytecoins.world:8081/json_rpc
1.3. Which you can connect remotely on the new wallet - https://blog.bytecoins.world/guide/remotenode.html
2. We have really sexy list of bytecoin nodes - https://node.bytecoins.world/list.html
2.1 Soon will be published instructions - HOW TO make own public node for everyone.
3. Now we have lot of interesting charts - https://chart.bytecoins.world/
3.1 There are charts which have chainradar and minergate, but too we have new, that nobody have - for example https://chart.bytecoins.world/transactionsb.html
4. Our Countdown work as before but on own API now - https://countdown.bytecoins.world/

5. There is Blog what will updates - https://blog.bytecoins.world/
5.1 And FAQ page where you can ask anything, or find answer - https://blog.bytecoins.world/faq.html

6. alpha version of bcn converter - https://bytecoins.world/converter.html  - very raw now.

So there is not only https://lottery.bytecoins.world/ and https://faucet.bytecoins.world/


And this is only 2 months of our project.


What is Planned to make.


- Bytecoin Freelance Platform 

- Local.Bytecoins.World (like localbitcoins)

- Bytecoin Middle Man Service - on it will work two services above

- Really very soon - Bytecoin Pools Statistic

- Bytecoin Exchanger

- and maybe Mining Pool (but there are a lot of pools, don`t know if need one more)


So, bytecoins.world isn't scam and this project with you until the full spreading of Bytecoin over the world.

If you want - you can help this project with donations here - http://donate.bytecoins.world/ I will be very very greatful.

More than likely they were trying to get more attention for the Bytecoin fork which is Monero so they decided to try to discredit Bytecoin.

Well, today we are here to help destroy one of those myths with solid evidence that Bytecoin did indeed exist on the web prior to 2014 by searching the internet archive Wayback Machine.

After many hours of research I have found strong evidence of there existence to at least the beginning of 2013.

Great day dear Bytecoin enthusiasts!

I am excited to finally get to share an extensive summary of the full History of the Bytecoin's Untraceable Tokens.
An Idea first introduced back in May 17, 2017 is now reaching its pre-funding stage of its development.

In this video I review the 3 Bytecoin blogs related to the tokens and many questions that were asked about the 
announcement.

Here is the link to online thread I found about Bytecoin while searching Google for ""untraceable tokens""

https://deeponion.org/community/threads/bytecoin-bcn-proof-of-live-with-untracable-tokens.15970/

Below are the links to each one of the announcements:

May, 2017- https://bytecoin.org/blog/untraceable-tokens

Dec, 2017- https://bytecoin.org/blog/untraceable-tokens-and-proof-of-concept

Mar, 2018- https://www.reddit.com/r/BytecoinBCN/comments/86ouzj/untraceable_tokens_topic_to_be_discussed/ 


The community is the one that has the power to spread the message and voice it's opinion.
Bytecoin wants to hear from you about the Untraceable Tokens ICO:

Ill start - Con is less coins we get daily with our current hardware.  A lot less!

These ASIC miners  are just trying to get a ROI for their expensive machines after Monero forked.  They're raping our network for the last minable coins and selling the Bytecoin off for Monero.  They are going to suck the remaining minable coins dry and definitely won't be there to mine the small transaction fees.

By Bytecoin not doing an emergency fork, AND SOON, it's basically a fuck you to every CPU and GPU miner that has helped keep this coin alive over these past number of years.

So to recap:

1) ASIC miners pillaging our network and selling off for XMR
2) True core supporters and miners alienated
3) By the time BCN is fully mined, ASICs will exit leaving a vacuum due to smaller miners and true supporters having been alienated months before

Let BCN do their thing because bitching and demanding isnt going to solve anything.

Welcome to our second AMA with the Bytecoin Dev Team and the BCN Community in Korea.

Today the topic of our AMA will be focused on the Asian Market Expansion and the ASIC mining situation. We plan to conduct the AMA for 90 minutes, 7:00PM - 8:30PM GMT +9. Please keep questions focused on these topics as other questions/comments will be removed or answered at a later date.

Please note that this is our first bilingual AMA, all questions in English will be answered directly by BCN_official in English, all questions in Korean will be answered in Korean by our community representatives - blackijin and lindox1020.

Below you can see a list of rules which we will use to moderate this thread so please read them carefully before commenting!

AMA rules:

We are happy to answer any and all topic related questions. Please keep comments civil and polite. All initial responses to posters must contain a properly punctuated question.

Questions which will not be addressed in this AMA: Tech support or account issue related questions, for help with that please email us at Contact@bytecoin.org or on Telegram at bcn_official. Aggressive or non topic posts will be removed by the moderator.

Comments will be removed under a few circumstances: 

1. Abusive or harassing comments
 
2. Comments where there would be no possibility of a real answer, especially where it is deliberately creepy or offensive. 

3. ""I bet OP won't answer this""-type responses, which usually come after the OP has finished responding to questions.

I’m happy to to say that the Poloniex campaign has brought us some results as we have finally received some live feedback, both from the support team and the personal managers. The Poloniex Dev team has started the integration of the new software but it will still require some additional time on their side though. 

For now I would like to ask you to create some tickets/write to the personal managers in [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/support). The community demand really helps a lot and it’s stated that their team reviews every proposal which is sent, that is why it could definitely have an influence on Bitfinex’s decision. 

Please, take this campaign seriously, while I’ll continue the negotiations with some other major merchants. Let’s get the attention of more exchanges with the power of the community! 

Cheers,
Jenny

It's time to unite and start the campaign for getting unblocked on Poloniex one more time! Here's a list of things that everyone has to do:

1. Go to the Poloniex site and start creating tickets. Here's a link for submitting a ticket to Poloniex support - https://poloniex.freshdesk.com/support and/or https://poloniex.com/contact

2. Drop an email with the request to unblock BCN to these emails - contact@poloniex.com and tristan@poloniex.com

3. (Advanced). The best way to reach Poloniex is to write to a personal manager. In case you've got one, please, do it immediately. The user who will be able to unblock us on Polo will be rewarded with a special gift.

4. Make as many tweets and replies to the @Poloniex account as you can https://twitter.com/Poloniex

The main idea which has to be mentioned in the message is that Bytecoin is one of the oldest coins ever listed on Poloniex. At the very beginning of 2018 Bytecoin had USD 40+ million daily trading volume on Poloniex. The whole community is willing to trade there, and we're able to provide the Poloniex team with all of the details regarding the integration with the new software versions available here: https://github.com/bcndev/bytecoin as well as the wiki for the integration https://github.com/bcndev/bytecoin/wiki

*Tip: earlier Poloniex had a priority support for the disabled/frozen/lost 2FA accounts. Try to make 2 tickets - with general problem and the priority one.

The Bytecoin community has proven to be one of the strongest and most reliable in the crypto world. It’s our common goal to increase the trading volume and involve more people in the BCN ecosystem. Let's do it one more time!

Yours truly,
The Bytecoin Team","false","8b7fld",NA,0,NA,"false",1529573803,"false","self","t5_31ues","false","",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/BytecoinBCN/comments/8b7fld/bytecoin_poloniex_campaign/","t3_8b7fld",NA,NA,"","",0,0

We recognize the frustration (or support) that a lot of you have have about the ASIC Mining situation. A lot of you have been making posts about this either in support or against this and I hear you loud and clear. I have sent a message out to the Developers today and we have planned a meeting with the whole team this weekend to discuss this pressing issue.

We won’t wait until the AMA (as we originally planned), my best guess is we will have our official response ready sometime early next week.

I understand how important it is to our community to have a consensus on this so please be patient with us as we assemble the team and decide how best to move forward. 

All the best,

I have a couple of questions regarding the Untraceable Tokens Project.

1. In the May 17, 2017 ""Untraceable Tokens"" Blog you mentioned a feature 
that ""[you] have laid a foundation for"". What was that feature and is 
it still in the works?

2. In the Dec 5, 2017 ""Untraceable Tokens and Proof of Concept"" it was mentioned

a. ""The code which is used today by the whole ecosystem isn’t compatible with the concept of untraceable tokens""
- If Bytecoin [BCN] is untraceable wouldn't it make it easier to work together with untraceable tokens?

b. ""The thing is that it’s quite impossible to implement the same functions as the original smart contracts have used in the code which are used now.""
- Can you elaborate on that?


c. ""it’s rather difficult for Bytecoin’s blockchain and untraceable tokens to be compatible""
- Can you briefly explain why it's necessary to make CORE changes to something that is already untraceable, unlikable, anonymous and private?


d. "" The answers will be ready at the very beginning of 2018 when all of you will be able to use the beta-version of the new software to find out the magnitude of the changes we’ve been working so hard on.""
- What were you guys inferring to?

3. In the Mar 23, 2018 ""[Untraceable Tokens] Topic to be discussed""reddit post you mentioned:
a. ""we’ll need to start our own ICO to raise the capital""
-Is this an Initial Coin Offering for a token that users can use?

Or Is this only meant for fundraising?


4. There are, and are going to be a lot of new innovative projects coming out, which would also bring a lot of Initial Coin Offerings.
- Do you currently see any 'competition' in that particular crypto space?

Thank you so much for your time!

It contained a few k bytecoins, and my friend still thinks it is a cool gift. however transferring it on his main wallet proved to be a huge pain.

first we created a desktop wallet, and synced its blockchain to full. and first shock hit us. there is no way to import paper wallet private keys. not without scrapping the first wallet. all that effort was for nothing. 

""no problem"", we said. we created a new wallet from his paper wallet pvkey. and baaammm another shock. desktop wallet started to redownload blockchain all over again. yes, the data.mdb file has bloated to 24.5 gb and growing. it will become 48 gb probably.

trying to use it as a light wallet failed as well. peers are either not working or not responding.

to all who is positive on bytecoin and people who are pro-crypto, ask yourself this. we trust millions of our dollars to these systems. and what we get is amateur level wallet apps at best. what a joke. 

don't think i am trying to create a bytecoin fud. most altcoins are like that. bad programming, releasing incomplete code, bad ui design is a huge problem of crypto overall. but none was as frustrating as bcn.

If they heard something, it was probably BTC they heard of. For that reason, it may be intelligent to rename bytecoin into BitcoinByte (BCB) and give it a more ""cash like"" logo like the BTC.

* Multisig and script developers
* Microtransaction engineers
* Javascript crypto developers
* UX/UI designers specializing in user\-only security \(Cryptocurrencies are among the few setups where *only* the users must have access to his private keys. very difficult to design around that.\)
* Bytecoin asset specific traders

* Mining pool operators
* Bytecoin gambling service operators
* TOR market operators
* Crypto speializing lawyers \(all these startups need to get advice somewhere!\)
* Bytecoin exchanges
* Bytecoin  ETF operators
* Bytecoin ecosysytem

in my opinion More jobs opportuniy will come in the next months as the bytecoin team should work on  more new services such as:

/ Bytecoin atm providers

/Bytecoin fraud detection services

* [Open Transactions](http://opentransactions.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) federated server operators
* Bytecoin asset rating agencies \(stocks, bonds, and all kinds of new assets\)
* Bytecoin  contract lawyer. A mix between lawyer and crypto developer
* Decentralized identity verification services \(Like centralized certificate authorities today, just on the blockchain\)
* Bytecoin contract verification services
* Specific database development companies for blockchain solutions
* Oracle services \(e.g. for Codius [Open\-source Hosting Platform for Smart Programs](http://codius.org/)\)
* Trusted data feed providers for oracles
* DAC\-specific derivative traders and contract writers
* More gateway services \(for stocks, bonds, and tons of other traditional assets\)

We don’t know how it works, and don’t any details yet. I think the dev team will give us info on Bytecoin birthday as an event. 

Anyway, Bytecoin will be mined very soon. Before the last coin is mined, the dev team has to increase its price - otherwise, not many people will mine Bytecoin, then it’s a huge threat to its network. The next couple months are crucial moment for Bytecoin itself. 

The dev team really wants/needs/has to increase Bytecoin proce (I want that too). The easiest way to increase its price is pumping with Bitcoin. However, this costs a lot of money and is really risky. Moreover, pumping with Bitcoin could destroy Bytecoin economy (remember the dev team worked so hard to list the coin on Asian exchanges). 

However, there is a better and easy way to increase the price: **Hard fork.** I think (and I hope) the Bytecoin dev team will fork the current Bytecoin. Not just to upgrade it - hard fork to create different chain. And the new coin (maybe called Kilocoin?) will support smart contract. Think it as Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. 

In this way, the Bytecoin holders will have the same amount of ‘Kilocoin’ so everyone wants to be a Bytecoin holder. Therefore, the price will be increased by the demand. 

The best scenario is the current Bytecoin would support smart contract with (100%) backward compatibility (without hard fork) - but I don’t think it’s possible.

We have upcoming hard fork. I can’t wait to see the new version of Bytecoin. The first and the only privacy cryptocurrency.

I finally decided to withdraw all 5,047, so I hit WITHDRAW and it said that it sent my BCN to the wallet address (which is the official BCN beta wallet). I waited around 2 days and it still hasn't arrived and it says on the website to contact support if it's been 24 hours+, so I messaged support and showed them undeniable proof that i withdrew the BCN and it was supposed to be in my wallet, BUT ITS NOT. The support is telling me that I need a payment ID for BCN/XMR or else they can't track it and the coins wont arrive. So basically on the website is says nowhere about requiring payment ID or else (WE can scam you) and it literally says that the payment ID is optional on the withdraw page and also my wallet doesn't require or have a payment ID in the first place. 

PROOF of withdraw: https://imgur.com/a/RAiYUHH

And screenshot of support saying the coins wont arrive because of no payment ID: (which is optional on their website)
https://imgur.com/a/Sn7gRm4

SO basically I have no idea what to do because the Eobot support is useless and telling me I need to contact the Bytecoin team because they can't do anything about this. Sucks seeing this happen in the crypto community because all it does is create mistrust and makes it look bad.

I recently purchased 357,000 BCN on Stocks.Exchange at about 3-4 cents. Trying to take advantage of the high Binance prices. But my wallet has been disabled for days. At the time of purchase BCN was well over 22 cents. I tried to send my BCN to binance  but my wallet was disabled. A few hours later They enabled my account briefly and I sent it over to binance. At this time the price was about 6-7c. Transfer took hours. Then errored out. Now the price is less than 1 cent. 

I did lose money in Binance for the same coin.. I purchased a separate amount for 3c per coin and it dropped to 1c. I take full accountability for that but Stocks.exchange has royally screwed me over. They have held onto my coin all the way down to less than 1c.

Is there anything I can do? Basically I'm down from 16.5k to 3.5k just on StocksExchange and they still haven't released it!

Yeah I learned my lesson, I'm a newb to Crypto currencies and investment in general but I am desperately seeking any type of advice.

EDIT: Response from StocksExchange. Whatever you do, don't use this site.
https://imgur.com/gallery/o41wPYu

EDIT 2: Looks like they finally renabled the BCN wallet. I sent it to my other wallet to be safe. Will update if it goes through. Still pissed that all the other exchanges were fixed pretty quickly but StocksExchange broken for days.

First here is a backstory of my current situation. 
&gt;On 2018-05-08 11:06:22 I decided to buy BCN. 
&gt;I first used my Ripple balance to buy BTC on Binance. 
&gt;That transaction was successful and I was ready to buy BCN. 
&gt;I downloaded the 2.0.2 Desktop wallet that was available (win 64bit)
&gt;I then used Bitplace to transfer my newly acquired BTC into BCN

This is when the headache starts. The synch was taking forever but I let it do it's thing. After it finished my balance was not showing. There was no ""reset"" wallet option in the file tab. Then bytecoin announces a new wallet to be used. By the way in this wallet (and the new one) there is also no ""backup"" button. I export my key and wallet to an external file manually and uninstall the old wallet for the new one. 
The new wallet doesn't have the reset feature either (this was the old way of getting your balance to appear that I saw from my research) 

I do have my BTC withdrawals logged on Binance. 
I dont have a balance in my BCN wallet... 

Can someone please explain to me what I should be doing? 

Thank you

I bought thousands of BCN on Poloniex and once they put their wallet back online I made a couple withdrawals to Binance. After an hour, and then 20 minutes for the next, they were assigned txid's and thus got some sort of confirmation that they'd be added to the BCN blockchain. Unfortunately, Poloniex seems to have created some sort of fork that isn't on the main blockchain, so the transaction isn't showing up at Binance or on a BCN blockchain explorer even. This means my thousands of coins are stuck until Poloniex honours my support request that they refund my BCN that they lost.

I feel bad for missing out on a great trading opportunity, but worse for people who cannot afford for this sort of failure to happen to them. If the price of BCN crashes much more, I'll have a hard time recouping my invested Bitcoin, even if I get my BCN coins back from Poloniex.
ADDED: It seems there may have been ""consensus"" problems on the Bytecoin network. In other words, double spends, or confirmed transactions that aren't honoured on forked versions of the blockchain?

I raised an exchange order on BitPlace and sent Ethereum(ETH) to the destination address specified in the order. However, even after my funds got deposited to destination address I didn't get my BCN. I thought that this may be due to network issues that BCN is facing. So, requested BitPlace exchange to refund the Ethereum(ETH).

Lesson 1: Remember, BASHERS NEVER Bash A BAD Coin. Check the boards for coins with no potential. They never have any Bashers. Bashers only go after coins that are moving up or have excellent potential to do so.

Lesson 2: BASHERS ALWAYS BRING UP OLD NEWS THAT YOU HAVE HEARD MANY TIMES. New startup cryptos always have a few bits of bad news. The Basher will post this over and over again.

Lesson 3: BASHERS POST MANY TIMES A DAY. They try to wear you out. They comment on everything, every other post, and can answer every question. THEY KNOW IT ALL! There is no positive comment they won't Bash. They try to control the board.

Lesson 4:  BASHERS WILL LIE TO YOUR FACE. Never trust a Basher. The truth is that every crypto project will make mistakes. What new coin hasn't? The Basher will compare your coin to a another, trying to lure you into making an Apples to Oranges comparison. Remember each project is unique and while it is prudent to seek out established indicators, do so with care and don't take someone else's word for it.

BASHERS WANT TO WHISPER IN YOUR EAR - PLANT A SEED OF DOUBT, AND HOPE THAT YOU ARE NOT SAVVY ENOUGH TO RESEARCH THE TRUTH ON YOUR OWN. This is how they achieve their greatest success.

Lesson 5: Bashers know YOU CAN'T VERIFY THEIR STATEMENTS. That's why they make the vague statements they do. They rely on you being to lazy to research their droppings other than to scan the board for others opinions. This is particularly dangerous when you consider that Bashers work in packs and often validate and back up each others nonsense with what appears to be ""innocuous and unsolicited"" verification by comrade Bashers. Let's face it, we are all conditioned to ""believe"" everything we see in writing. If others by virtue of their ""posts"" also confirm this belief, then we are subconsciously doomed to swallow the hook, line and sinker

Lesson 6: The Bashers PLAY ON YOUR LACK OF KNOWLEDGE. They can lie about information and you won't know the difference (unless you have done your own DD on the company and know the truth and facts).

This is your investment... work for it, protect it and don't panic on the words of every shadowy figure that ""has your best interest in their heart"". Consider that one factor: Someone you have never met, is not a member of your family, is now, out of the goodness of their hearts - GIVING YOU FREE ADVICE (that you didn't ask for). It's a no brainer. They have motives $$$$$$$$$$$$.

Lesson 7: Bashers play on your lack of patience. You have held a coin for a while. You know it will be a big someday, but the BASHER CAN GET TO YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE TIRED OF WAITING FOR YOUR GAIN. That's when the Basher is best. You are tired. You have forgotten the goal for the coin was to hold it for one year. The Basher is bothersome, so you dump it on a bad day. Some others also dump. Then you get mad for your loss and return to let everyone know how mad you are. Then you turn into a semi-Basher as well. THE BASHER HAS WON, AND GAINED A NEW ALLY - YOU!

Lesson 8: The truth is not important. Lies are the norm. Post continuously on the board every day. They are trying to scare the newbies that are just investigating a coin. They are trying to wear down the faithful longs on the board and gain free reign and control.

Do not underestimate a Bashers influence on a coin. The Pro's are good at what they do and what they do is profit from your losses.

A complete idiot, most readers are not convinced he knows anything about crypto in general. The type that says a coin ""sucks"", but gives no rationale. Repeats themselves over and over.

Golden Rule:

IGNORE THEM ... In general, NEVER ENGAGE A BASHER. Make them read all the posts and think up ways to enter the discussion. NEVER ENGAGE A BASHER; if you do so then YOU BECOME THE BASHER,S AID! If you feel compelled to challenge a Basher do so without mentioning his/her true alias in your response. This will make it hard for the Basher to use your post as a revenue stream.

I have not been in crypto very long. In fact, it was Dec 9th 2017 when I made my first purchase. That coin was BCN. I bought purely on what I could afford. Looking back with what little experience I have accumulated, that was definitely a risky bet.

It slowly increased in value until early January and it spiked to ~.012. I had roughly 100k. I missed the peak but I did sell before it and all other coins crashed before the Chinese New Year. I also benefited from DCN. It pumped to almost .01 cents and I was able to cash out pretty nicely. But I digress.

I've seen on every exchange, congestion issues when something crazy happens in crypto. For example, when BCH was listed on Coinbase and when BTC hit $20k. Reddit and HitBTC trollbox was loaded with people upset about the delays or wallet's being down. Most of those were accusing the exchanges for stealing their funds because the delay was so long. 

One thing I've noticed is every time something doesn't go right they assume the worst. Scam coin, scam exit, etc. Chances are, it was just a programmer/developer nightmare where old Murphy showed up. BCN has been around way to long for this to be how they end it. Binance and the other exchanges make way to much money on traffic and wouldn't continue to act like something is wrong if there wasn't. Granted BCN didn't do itself any favors by being slow on communication. Yet based on what I've witnessed with every coin, it wouldn't have been enough. I don't think BCN_Official could have said anything that would have made a difference. People were beyond reasoning with.

While I'm not a programmer or developer I imagine that the sudden load on the blockchain and the servers at the exchanges could not handle the traffic. This fiasco could be bitter sweet for the BCN community. While you may not have cashed in on the Binance price increase, the BCN system had a live stress test which is valuable for the community as a whole. I'm sure the programmers/developers were just as surprised as everyone else that it didn't function. However, this now gives the BCN team a very realistic worst case example and shows them things that need to be improved (what they thought the system could handle) and things that did great. Ultimately, this should result in a better system and product that will serve BCN stakeholders and users in the future. Simulations and scaling tests are great on paper. Its when these systems are tested in real time with real traffic that you honestly know how stable everything is.

I know this doesn't help those that were hoping to turn a HUGE profit; nor does it help those that bought in high a Binance (FOMO struggle is real) and lost. I do hope that this settles some fears about what happened and what's in store for the future. This is just my opinion.","false","8igqi1",NA,0,NA,"false",1529705002,"false","self","t5_31ues","false","",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/BytecoinBCN/comments/8igqi1/opinion_of_bcn/","t3_8igqi1",NA,NA,"","",0,0

Yesterday’s news has shown the way on how a community’s power has to work. Hundreds of emails sent by the team and our thousands of supporters around the world have finally reached the recipient and after a time Poloniex has finally enabled Bytecoin’s deposits and withdrawals. Happy trading, Bytecoineers!

For now I would like to ask you to create some tickets/write to the personal managers in [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/support). The community demand really helps a lot and it’s stated that their team reviews every proposal which is sent, that is why it could definitely have an influence on Bitfinex’s decision.
Please, take this campaign seriously, while I’ll continue the negotiations with some of the other major merchants. Let’s get the attention of more exchanges with the power of the community!

Yours truly, 

The Bytecoin team

Even though Monero (XMR) developed as a result ofBytecoin (BCN), Monero (XMR)is presently at the 12th position in market cap as of the time of writing this article, while BCN in the 21th position. This as a result of the withdrawal of most of its community members when a pre-mined scam was announced in the media.

However, in recent time, most investors are beginning to trust the coin and it was able to hit about 154% increase within 30 days, from April 2, 2018, to May 2, 2018. BCN traded at $0.002166 on April 2 and $0.005514 on May 2.

What Makes Bytecoin (BCN) a Good Bye?

1)	Return of investors interest:

The return of investors could be observed from the volume of trades BCN experienced between April 2 to May 2, 2018, which ensured that it returned back to its market capitalization that is above $1 billion within this duration. During this time, its trading volume moved from 825,353 to 6,643,490 which represents 5,818,137 increase and a percentage rise of 704.93%.

2)	Addition of new exchanges on the horizon:

Even though Poloniex exchange stopped deposits and withdraws of Bytecoin (BCN), on May 1st the ban was lifted and transactions could be processed. Also, the Bytecoin (BCN) team is on the verge of reaching consensus with Binance and Bitfinex, which has led to most of its community members to  hodl because such trades increase value more than its present performance. This is because less than 1 billion BCN remains to be mined, out of close to 185 billion in total supply.

3)	Strategic partnerships:

BCN team are striving had to ensure that its holders and traders are open to manymarkets. Because of this, they are handing out an airdrop of 195k BCN to the first 20 traders who make the most trades, with a benchmark of 25k BCN to be traded in the partnering exchange bitexbook.com. The price ranges from 65k BCN to 2500 BCN. The duration is from April 30th, 2018 to May 20th, 2018.

4)	Acceptance of ASIC mines:

In a place where most coins refused to accept ASIC mines for mining, even Monero (XMR), the BCN team said that to improve the efficiency of mining and also the profitability they will accept ASIC mines. This is because Bitmain, the producer of the ASIC mines, had made a commitment to introduce FPGA devices in its new ASIC mines ensuring an easy adjustment to a code change that will not affect the mines. They also believe that ASIC mines are better than CPU and GPU mines. These mining activities will increase BCNvalue.

Based on the four points discussed, I believe you will easily agree with me as to why I believe BCN is a worthy buy.

So, did we have the great honor today of witnessing a nearly perfectly executed scam? Did BCN devs play the market like puppet masters?

Announcement of listing on binance, followed by closing of the network. Then they artificially inflated the price on binance by selling back and forth, and through that, created demand on other markets due to the possible gains with arbitage. (who else should have had massive amounts of BCN on binance, if not the devs? Who would have known about the listing soon enough to transfer, before the network was closed down?). 

People who bought the coins on the other platforms are now nice bagholders, since the artificial price inflation is over, and nobody will buy for those prices now.

But of course everybody is innocent until guilt is proven, so we'll just file it as a tragic chain of misfortunate events.

I was travelling with Friend A, when friend B was frantically calling Friend A about the Binance price around 3PM local time, within the first hours of the first sale on Binance. Neither of them were able to transfer into Binance.

Basically, the point is, people are holding BCN all over the world. Also, both Innosilicon and Bitmain probably have ginormous wallets.

I have one questions and one suggestion why dont we do some actions,  all of us send e mail to bittrex support to put BCN on their site. If we all send now we can get rid of things that happend on Binance and we will get respect from other people. I am sick of that they always write scam scam. I would liko to prove to the people that BCN is not a scam and that we have future, 

Second:

What you think about some meet up ? I am from Serbia and i would like to spread word about BCN, I would like to some BCN official tell us what they think about that and if there is possibility to make some donation to organised all event. We can do some marketing, have a event in some kind of amphitheater, we will talk about BCN make some presentation, we can make some gifts at the end.

Hello Guys , lot of you was thinking it's impossible to be listed on Binance , our Team proved these guys wrong .

Lot of guys now think that adding it to Binance it's everything , well it's not . there many other exchanges Bytecoin needs to be listed on .

1- First of all i need you to Upvote this Post so that no one misses it .

2- I'm gonna list some big exchanges Emails , write to them and Tweet and try to convince them why they should list Bytecoin ( i think Being on  Binance is gonna make this much easier ).

3-  Please take it seriously , exchanges get convinced when they see high demands .

4- If we get listed on 3 at least Big exchange , we expect BCN to reach 0.2  $ or 0.3 $ easily

5- Let's Invade these Exchanges :

Since this is a little over my technical experience, does anyone care to comment on what advantages Bytecoin has over Monero (which wont allow ASIC mining) on this issue?

Will ASIC mining help reduce the issue (overloading the system) we just experienced in the last few days?

With Bytecoin allowing ASIC mining they are going green because these miners use a lot less electricity than the old school way (graphic cards).  Could this be the advantage that BCN is using early in the game to beat Monero?

I know some of you are upset over ASIC mining, but in my opinion this is the future of mining coins because of speed and power efficiency.  Anyone not seeing this is blind because BCN must take advantage of the future now or we could end up like Sears (best example I got).","false","8iot8z",NA,0,NA,"false",1529709086,"false","self","t5_31ues","false","",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/BytecoinBCN/comments/8iot8z/asic_mining_bcn_and_how_it_will_prevent/","t3_8iot8z",NA,NA,"","",0,0

I kept seeing people saying it would hit a dollar next, WE'RE GOING TO THE MOON! etc. What did you think would happen once Binance re-enabled deposits (they did btw)? The price jump was unnatural and unsustainable. Do you think it's normal for one market to be trading so insanely high compared to other markets?

If you bought without doing your research or understanding what was happening, okay sure that was just ignorance and FOMO typical stuff. But to everyone who actually knew this coin before binance listed it: why tf would you buy now? Of course the price was going to crater, literally anyone could see that. I don't understand why you would buy when it was inflated and then be suprised that you lost thousands of dollars now that it's returned to a more realistic price.

I guess I'm just frustrated and tired of seeing so many people posting that everything is fine, and then seeing the people coming in and saying they just lost thousands. Use your heads ffs. When a coin goes up 100s of percents in a matter of minutes something isn't right and it's CERTAINLY not the time to buy. It's the time to unload and get out before the shit hits the fan because that kind of increase isn't gonna last.

**edit: what I'm trying to say is do your due diligence. It takes literally minutes to go and check what the price was before it was listed and check the [price on other exchanges](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bytecoin-bcn/#markets). One glance and you can tell that the price is going to crash as soon as the open deposits. And if you are interested in this coin for god sake's do the math and figure out how high the market cap would have to be for the price to reach $1, $10, $100 or any other ridiculous number that people throw out.

I don't want to cry wolf on this, but someone definitely made a real error here.","false","8i2t22",NA,0,NA,"false",1529698081,"false","self","t5_31ues","false","",NA,"false","true",NA,"/r/BytecoinBCN/comments/8i2t22/a_lot_of_people_say_this_is_not_the_devs_fault_but/","t3_8i2t22",NA,NA,"","",0,0

Monero is a true shit coin.  It is just copy-and-paste coin, just like every other 100 altcoins out there.  Don't believe me? Then check Monero desktop wallet.  It doesn't fcking sync.  **The most basic function of the wallet**: SYNC IS NOT WORKING. It's because the programming source code for the wallet is a just joke.  The deadlock issue from UI thread is not even fixed for last couple years (UI freezing everytime). 

I was a Monero holder. But as soon as I download the wallet software, I figured out that Monero is a scam. It's because Monero DEV CANNOT FIX THE WALLET PROBLEMS. They are not capable of writing high-skilled codes. They know how to code, but they are NOT good at it.  Writing codes for crypto-currency requires a lot of skills and cryptography knowledge.  And there are not many people can do that. The cryptography knowledge itself is so difficult, literally there are not many people can do that on the earth (but there are tons of software developers).

Bytecoin is built from a scratch. Meaning that it is not copy-and-paste. Bytecoin dev team created the CryptoNote technology from nothing. And the team announced it on the deep web first (2012) because they truly care about privacy. After enough testing (2 years), they announce Bytecoin to the public (2014). Those early adapters on the deep web between 2012 and 2014, they are true resistances.  They resist privacy invasion from the big power. The team sincerely cares about privacy, they create the technology for other people. For the other people who probably use their technology even though they don't even know what Bytecoin is.  Just like Satoshi Nakamoto.

Do you think they want to destroy what Bytecoin has built (the ecosystem and the network) in last couple years by dumping all their coins? Even Bytecoin was super cheap, there were people who mine Bytecoin. Its network has existed since 2012, and never went down because there were/are people who mine Bytecoin even though it was not profitable. 

Monero always attack Bytecoin.  They called us a scam.  They called us a shit coin.  They called us we are stupid. But the technology never lie.  The Bytecoin code talks itself.  The code is so elegant and mathematically perfect, every one has copied and pasted from Bytecoin code. Monero is one of them.  Monero dev team is afraid of Bytecoin because their investor will know the truth eventually. The truth that **Monero dev can't even code.** They are afraid of us, so they attack us.

If you found Bytecoin long time ago, you are smart. You are the one of people who really know the true value regardless of other's opinion.  If you found Bytecoin not that long ago, you are lucky. But if you own any Monero, check their wallet software, like I said.

This is a just beginning of Bytecoin. Next couple years, we will see a lot of drama, just like Bitcoin did. I am so thrilled to be part of its history.

Cheers.

#1. Never buy a just listed ""New Coin"" on Binance.  
#2. Never buy crypto coins when they are at their ""All Time High"" price.  
#3. Don't even bother trying to day trade if you don't understand how markets work, or have any experience. You will get wrecked and lose a lot of money. You need to understand most of the trading, including pump and dumps are executed by ""Bots"" which use algorithmic trading or ""High-frequency trading"". You will not be able to compete with computer scripts/programs.  
#4. Research and understand what the term ""Market Cap"" actually means in relation to Cryptocurrencies. Read this article to educate yourself about Crypto/Marketcaps. https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@j0z0r/lessons-for-cryptocurrency-newbies-1-market-cap-vs-price-per-coin .  
#5. Take a look at coins like Trx, Xvg, and others like them. What they have in common is very high circulating supplies of tokens/coins. This will prevent the price from every rising significantly, or ""mooning"" which most of you who get burned are after, lets be real.   
#6. If you want to make money in Crypto, ""Research Research Research"". Read up as much as you can on a bunch of different Crypto-coins that are available, don't let people shill you on shit coins. If you want to make money in the short-long term, Look for coins with ""LOW MARKETCAPS"" and ""LOW CIRCULATING COIN SUPPLIES"". All these coins that are less than a dollar are mostly shit coins, there is a reason they are so cheap. Cheap does not mean better, or that you will moon... It is cheap because there are way too many coins in circulation which will prevent the price from ever rising much.   
#7. Part of the reason Bitcoin, Ethereum, Genesis Vision, Nebulas, NEO, Monero, QTUM, ETC, and others are so high in price is because they have a ""low circulating coin amount"" relative to these other shit coins with Billions or Tens of Billions in circulation.

As i am on vacation and i have only my phone i didnt check everything at 100% and when i saw that BCN dropped on Binance from 2500 to 1050 i said to myself hell yeah lets throw in 22 btc because its 20% more on polo and 40% more on hitbtc (on my phone i blindy saw 1500 and 1300) ... Hell yeah but it was 10x less - 150 and 130 ...

To my surprise since i am on vacation and im just on phone i didnt set any stop losses nor alarms so i woke up today and my 22 BTCs on Binance turned into 5,5 :))) (sadface)

Feels bad but hey life moves on and some shit will always happen, the most important thing is to never give up  .. I know that shitton of you lost alot of money but this is still new era of cryptos and if you know what to do you will always come back as ialways did and will do it again ...

Have a nice day and good luck with some kind of comeback in future :)

I panic sold ONT and lost quite a bit of money. Shouldn't have done that if you look at ONT now, so I didn't do it this time. I'm holding and hoping.""

People are saying different things in terms of what the (near) future holds for BCN. I hope I don't make a lazy impression by just asking other people, I did read ""a thing or two"", though about it on my own and tried to draw my own conclusions. But as far as crypto stuff goes, I'm just not capable enough so I can't trust my own opinion. That's why I'm asking yours.
My question is simple: 

Do you think it was a good choice to not panic sell and just hold? In other words: will the price will go up again, around 20 cents at some point? And of course please elaborate your answer. (Like I'm 8 years old.)

Welcome to the 3rd AMA with the Bytecoin Dev Team. Today the topic of our AMA will be the recent Binance Listing and Network Situation.

We plan to conduct the AMA for 90 minutes, from 17:30 - 19:00 GMT+1. Please keep questions focused on these topics as other questions/comments will be removed or answered at a later date.

Below you can see a list of rules which we will use to moderate this thread so please read them carefully before commenting!


About the AMA rules:

We are happy to answer any and all topic related questions. Please keep comments civil and polite. All initial responses to posters must contain a properly punctuated question.
Questions which will not be addressed in this AMA: Tech support or account issue related questions, for help with that please email us at Contact@bytecoin.org or on Telegram at bcn_official Aggressive or non topic posts will be removed by the moderator.


Comments will be removed under a few circumstances: 

1. Abusive or harassing comments 

2. Comments where there would be no possibility of a real answer, especially where it is deliberately creepy or offensive. 

3. ""I bet OP won't answer this""-type responses, which usually come after the OP has finished responding to questions. 

4. Repeatedly asking the same question, which violates Reddit's site-wide rules. 

5. A subreddit or other website organizing and voting for a group comment/question is considered to be vote cheating and is subject to removal. It is a violation of the rules of reddit and risks a site wide ban. 

6. Questions must be directed toward the individual(s) doing the IAMA. 

7. Under our policies, astroturfing is the practice of an individual or group of individuals who plant questions in an AMA post for a particular purpose. Behavior of this kind will result in a permanent ban from /r/BytecoinBCN/

Originally taken from GitHub, “forks” have overloaded the blockchain world. Despite the fact that there are now more than 1,600 crypto coins indexed by Coinmarketcap, there are only 5 [basic hash algorithms](http://www.bitcoinlion.com/cryptocurrency-mining-hash-algorithms/) widely spread in cryptocurrency community. 

**Forks: Good or Bad.**

There have been both successful and scam forks in cryptocurrency. 2017 has rewarded every single BTC holder with BCH and BTG, which increased their own shares by at least 20% just for importing their keys to the new clients. Bitcoin has never been an anonymous currency, combine that with the technical cons (slow transactions, overloaded networks, etc.) and you have a coin that has turned to a speculative mechanism.

However, some currencies have appeared later than Bitcoin and seem to have taken into consideration Bitcoin’s drawbacks and brought the real use-cases to real life. Let’s take a look at privacy-focused leader Monero, which has gained its reputation in untraceable transactions, widely spread in money laundering, darknet markets, and anonymous payouts. Launched in 2014 and originally forked from [Bytecoin](https://bytecoin.org/), Monero has accumulated its own community and vision of development.  Four years later, the leader of anonymous transactions made a hardfork, and as a result there at least 4 more new “Moneros” [appeared](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/monero-just-hard-forked-and-it-resulted-four-new-projects/) at the market. But something went wrong.

**Privacy or Profit.**

Monero’s hardfork was conducted as a reaction against ASIC mining, which was considered a centralisation risk. The hardfork was successful, but several forks have automatically appeared. The same logic worked here: import your keys and gain some free coins. Without a doubt, a big part of Monero’s community used this opportunity to fill their wallets with free coins, however, they were automatically [de-anonymized](https://www.coinbureau.com/news/monero-forks-airdrops-compromise-user-privacy/) in just a few seconds. Here comes the question: does Monero remain the most popular anonymous currency if a big part of their community has been compromised? The answer is “No, definitely not”. Fighting against centralisation is not worth a user’s privacy, and this previously known anonymous currency can only now be named as a “privacy focused” currency by the users who haven’t been compromised. 

On the contrary, Bytecoin has made the opposite decision: By allowing ASIC mining instead of letting their users be de-anonymized. The decision made by Bytecoin seems to be controversial, but it’s [stated](https://bytecoin.org/blog/the-asic-statement-clarification-from-the-bytecoin-team) that ASICs are protecting BCN from double spend as well as the uniformed distribution of the hashrate between pools is the direct prevention of 51% attacks. Here, counting both pros and cons of ASIC restrictions, Bytecoin has decided to allow these type of mining machines to protect the community from the risk of de-anonymization.
Going forward, AEON (one of Monero’s forks) is also [considering](https://np.reddit.com/r/Aeon/comments/8dhjtq/when_fork/) to make a hardfork to solve the ASIC mining problem. It looks like several AEON forks will appear as well, and AEON will lose its anonymous status as well. It would be very interesting to see if the AEON developers will consider the experiences of both Monero and Bytecoin.

**Conclusion.**

The cryptocurrency market is on it’s way up, and it seems that the correction has passed. In search of “easy money”, one has to choose between anonymity and profit, and conduct the proper research about the currency they invest in.

Если мало свободного места на диске ""С"".  

В меню «Выполнить» я набрал команду  %APPDATA% и попал в  C:\Users\.......\AppData\Roaming\ bytecoin. Я скопировал папку bytecoin и поместил эту копию на диск D. После этого я удалил папку bytecoin из директории C:\Users\.......\AppData\Roaming\ bytecoin.
Затем я навёл указатель мыши на ярлык Bytecoin на р. столе и выбрал пункт ""Properties"". Затем в поле ""Object"" я прописал новый путь по которому и будет происходить загрузка всего блокчейна и запуск кошелька:

I synced my desktop wallet, and now my balance is 0.00BCN! \- I didn't send anything to anyone or anywhere... \- so how can this be?

I tried to contact the support several times via  [contact@bytecoin.org](https://bytecoin.org/contacts#) and  [support@bytecoin.org](https://bytecoin.org/contacts#)  but nobody replies! The site  **bytecointalk.org**  is also blocked from google.

I also tried to reset my wallet already... nothing changed! still 0.00 BCN. And I have also tried to use other nodes by setting in preferences \-\-\&gt; connection \-\-\&gt;""remote dameon"" but this also didn't work.

So I tried already this advice: [https://www.reddit.com/r/BytecoinBCN/comments/7n0l0v/how\_to\_fix\_sync\_and\_zero\_balance\_problems/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BytecoinBCN/comments/7n0l0v/how_to_fix_sync_and_zero_balance_problems/)

but nothing changed! I have still 0.00BCN!

I am really so fucking angry about that fact, because nobody reacts and it seems to me, that maybe someone has stolen my BCN \(and that was quite a lot\)! 

Also how the BCN\-Team reacts \(because they don't react at all....\) and the fact that you can't issue such problems directly via the wallet sofware etc. is highly an untrustworthy behaviour!!

So I hope that anybody of you could help me or maybe at least someone of the BCN\-Team would read that and would react, otherwise all my money is lost or has been stolen... but then I will do further research and if necessary, I will initiate legal action because then it really needs to be considered seriously if Bytecoin is a big scam!!

So I hope, that anybody had the same problem or if somebody knows how to solve it...

thx!

Here, that friend there is the Bytecoin and later you will understand better why ...

PREMISE:
Currently, in a market so inclined to the maneuverability put in place by some users or organized bodies called ""whales"" more commonly, able to exploit the low total capitalization and the huge amount of money in their possession, we have been able to see the power of information also deliberately diverted for remuneration, to generate the right FUD or FOMO in order to profit by anticipating market trends. The purpose of the following article is not to give a financial advice, but to give readers the opportunity to have a broader view of the current scenario so as not to be easily influenced by market trends and circulating fake news basing their own chosen exclusively on their reasoning.

Let's start with a brief ""historical"" sign that we need to better understand what will come later. Bytecoin (BCN) was born in 2012 with deep fractures within the DEVteam that gave birth without arousing some kind of enthusiasm so much that since its birth, the protocol was forked several times giving rise to countless currencies based on the same algorithm. One of them was Monero, one of the most appreciated privacy coin together with Dash, Zcash.

Slowly the interest around the BCN project was extinguished in favor of the competition and for a few years Bytecoin went through a placid dormant phase in which the most incompetent and alleged ""crypto trader"" accused the project in several ways, knowing that the NCB it was a giant sleeper and it was better to remove it as soon as possible .... or at least they tried it; a giant is always better to bury him in which case he would wake up bringing problems for everyone and unfortunately for them, this just happened. With the new development team, Bytecoin started its own awakening, slow but steady. He began to attract investors, to collect consents and one step at a time he came to settle permanently in the Top 30 of Coin Market Cap, a first signal that perhaps the detractors have not been able to grasp, or have not taken seriously ... worse for their! Bytecoin users have been trying to push so many tokens ""burned"" all the time, but the team, focusing on the development of a blockchain and a wallet more powerful and reliable as well as on present and future partnerships, has always categorically opposed and later we will understand why.
As I said the DevTeam has continued to tighten agreements, release material and update the technology at the base of the project and this inevitably led some big exchanges to sniff out the INCREDIBLE earning potential. A few weeks ago a well-known Chinese company, leader in the mining sector, declared the release of the first ASIC able to undermine the cryptonight protocol. Among the general rejection by the currencies based on the aforementioned protocol, one remained silent once again letting the others say first what they thought and in the meantime the others rushed to the shelters by modifying the protocol in order to limit the functioning of the ASIC in the extraction process and masking this choice behind sudden and frankly ridiculous actions in favor of the community; Bytecoin instead, welcomed this news and supported the arrival of ASIC on its network. A few days later, ""strangely"", Bytecoin was listed on the largest exchange in the world BINANCE with a price explosion that saw him reach to reach 0.20% share ... coincidences it?
The peculiarity of this coincidence lies not only in the fact that both the mining company ASIC and Binance are in China, but also that the BCN Blockchain is ""apparently"" collapsed not being ""apparently"" ... able to withstand the traffic generated . After a few days of confusion, the DEVteam worked to restore the Blockchain and release several updates to make this happen. After a week the price of the money settled on figures more in line with other exchanges and the situation returned to normal. Too bad that the competitors, who had worked so hard to throw mud on the project, had realized that the ""sleeping giant"" had woken up completely and while they were struggling to prevent the project from becoming usable and profitable for others as well as for them (see magic walls with disproportionate quantities appeared out of nowhere and vanishing), the Bytecoin project was strengthened and the currency had ended in the eyes of the world, thus attracting the interest of big investors and showing them a small part of its huge potential.

But the worst for the other privacy coin had not yet arrived ...
Oh yeah! In parallel with the listing of BCN on Binance, Japan disclosed a list containing the best cryptocurrencies available on the market, recommending it to its investors and this list also included Bytecoin. A few days later however, Japan itself stated that the currencies based on the Cryptonight / Cryptonote algorithm as well as the other privacy coins were bad for the country by divulging the news that soon XMR together with DASH and ZCASH could have been delayed by many exchanges. In the list, however, Bytecoin did not appear continuing to remain the only currency based on that algorithm and with these peculiarities listed in the special list recommended by Japan. So many coincidences make a clue, many clues do a test would say ... Bytecoin is one step to become THE ONLY private currency used based on the Cryptonight algorithm and the blockchain test can be used to understand how many transactions succeeded in hold up and how many volumes he could manage. As a result, the team has resumed work on the new blockchain and soft fork, the huge amount of coins available will remain such because of the simple fact that will serve to cover the coin supply of competitors. Bytecoin has started its climb towards the monopoly of the Cryptonight algorithm and will soon replace all other competing currencies in the privacy markets. The price of now is a further confirmation as those who would not enter a project similar to these figures with the possibility of future gain that is expected? Simply connect the dots to the conclusion that Bytecoin will compensate for the purpose for which Bitcoin was born, not as a potential for growth in value or as ambition and quality of the project but as a use in everyday life.
""The Sleeping Giant woke up and started climbing to the summit!""
Observed the context in which it is moving Bytecoin and overflown on the technical features of the cryptonote protocol that you can read in several articles about it, let's come to the point on what might be one of the reasons why you are here, the price prediction. Given that no one can have the truth in his pocket, let alone think about it and draw some conclusions on the basis of concrete data.
The motto ""When Lambo?"" And ""When Moon?"" Which are especially popular on the Telegram channel is also accompanied by ""When 1 $?"" And perhaps its users are not entirely wrong ....
Bytecoin is therefore born with the intent to lend itself as a coin that can be spent in everyday life and this can already be seen from its roadmap which in the previous version was shown as follows:



[Bytecoin Roadmap 2018](https://bytecoin.org/storage/roadmap.png) 



As you can see, the main focus concerns the markets and the circuit that will allow the issuance of a rechargeable credit card that will allow to spend their NCBs in all affiliated stores and that will make agreements with the team in the future.
In order to make up for the purpose, a coin must be coined in large numbers and that is why you will have 184.47 million BCN circulating, of which 99.699% has already been mined.
Other peculiarities that must have the coin to work, are the stability and a price easily identifiable by both the buyer and the seller. Unlikely after the ""pizza day"", a consumer would use a currency with high volatility or that constantly requires a calculator and a converter under the hand to be spent. The same goes for the shopkeepers, being paid X and seeing the profit go down is not one of the best hypotheses. Even the future possibility and already put in the pipeline to run projects on its own Blockchain would benefit from price stability. Companies wishing to let their projects run on the Bytecoin network have the same needs as a retailer to monitor their revenues without excessive price fluctuations, whether good or bad.
If we add to this the peculiarity of BCN which is ""anonymity"", we can observe how the catchment area widens considerably adding to the simple consumers, a whole group of individuals who need this feature to protect their savings and that surely will be the crumbs owned by most of us. To this category are added all those who in the course of the regulations will suffer the ban of their countries, you can not take away what you are not able to CHECK!
*** So, according to my humble opinion, the coveted price of $ 1 is a goal that can be reached in the medium term and can be satisfied when all the pieces are in place on the roadmap. ***
The above may seem obvious and obvious now but you can see that this is not a summary of what has happened so far with data that objectively, each of you can go to check on the history. If you think instead that the tone is a bit 'too much conspiracy, you can always look elsewhere with the certainty that in the future we will have the opportunity to be able to compare again.
To all the owners of Bytecoin I make the most heartfelt congratulations for the tenacity that will repay them when the picture is complete and I hope for them that they do not get lost in the waves of the market caused by the dreaded whales.

Any coins which are able to be 51% attacked can easily take advantage of our dPoW (delayed Proof of Work). Komodo notarizes blockchains to the highest hashrate (currently bitcoin, but can change to any other blockchain when necessary)

For only 300 KMD a year ($900), any blockchain can notarize to Komodo, who then notarize to the Bitcoin. This solves the problem of all the recent 51% attacks.

Notarization ""protects"" in the sense that you must 51% attack BTC to get around delayed Proof-of-Work, and yes, it's impossible for notaries to be outmined, the code has their pubkeys hardcoded, they get special treatment.

Also, a 51% attack against KMD must be done within a 10 minute window, if your attack takes 15 minutes, you are screwed because that is how often BTC blocks come out, which have KMD metadata embedded in them (merkle roots)

1 - I installed the program (v. 2.0.4 or 3.1.1).
2 - Then I created a shortcut bytecoin-gui and put it on the desktop.
3 - I started the program using this shortcut.
4 - I created a new wallet and set a password for it. Synchronization started. I waited a bit and finished the program.
5 - In the ""Start"" menu, I typed the command %APPDATA% and was in the ""Roaming"" folder.
6 - Then I copied the folder ""bytecoin"" and placed it on disk ""D"".
7 - After that I deleted the ""bytecoin"" folder from the ""Roaming"" folder.
8 - Then in the ""Start"" menu I typed the command ""cmd"". You will see a black window for working with the command line. You will see a line similar to this: ""C:\Users\your user name&gt;"" and the cursor that will flash. You should write such a command:

MkLink /J ""C:\Users\your user name\AppData\Roaming\bytecoin"" ""D:\bytecoin""

The entire line should look like this:

C:\Users\your user name&gt;MkLink /J ""C:\Users\your user name\AppData\Roaming\bytecoin"" ""D:\bytecoin""

With the exception of “your user name”
 Write very carefully and do not miss the spaces.
9 - Collapse the command line and launch the program via the shortcut. Everything should work.

Как изменить путь для загрузки Bytecoin блокчейна с диска «С» на диск «D»
1 - Я установил программу (v. 2.0.4 или 3.1.1)
2 - Потом я создал ярлык bytecoin-gui и поместил его на рабочий стол.
3 - Я запустил программу при помощи этого ярлыка.
4 - Создал новый кошелёк и установил на него пароль. Началась синхронизация. Я подождал немного и завершил программу.
5 - В меню ""Пуск"" я набрал команду %APPDATA%  и оказался в папке ""Roaming"".
6 - Затем я скопировал папку ""bytecoin"" и поместил её на диск ""Д"".
7 - После этого я удалил папку ""bytecoin"" из папки ""Roaming"".
8 - В меню ""Старт"" я набрал команду ""cmd"". Перед вами появится чёрное окно для работы с командной строкой.  Вы увидите строку похожую на эту: "" C:\Users\your user name&gt;"" и курсор, который будет мигать.
Вы должны написать такую команду:

MkLink /J ""C:\Users\your user name\AppData\Roaming\bytecoin"" ""D:\bytecoin""

Короче, вся строка должна иметь такой вид( за исключением “your user name”т.к. у вас будет что то своё):

C:\Users\your user name&gt;MkLink /J ""C:\Users\your user name\AppData\Roaming\bytecoin"" ""D:\bytecoin""

Пишите очень внимательно и не пропускайте пробелы.
9 – Сворачиваете командную строку и через ярлык запускаете программу. Всё должно работать.

For several weeks after the listing of BCN on Binance, we can see sell/buy lower than the limit of 0.001 BTC on Binance.

They can dump easily the coin and make panic for people sell BCN with lower price.

Link of the picture: https://image.ibb.co/jpB4yJ/dump_bcn.jpg

I want some explanations, how they can do that? The limit of sell/buy for BCN is at 0.001 BTC , so this is impossible to sell 1 BCN with 80 sats for example. 

Maybe I have forgot something, but this is not right. I have wait several weeks to see if Binance fix this problem but now people who make effort to pump the coin are destroyed in couple of days or hours with this issue.

The impact is huge because the issue is on Binance. On other exchange the impact will be lower.

Thank you in advance.

This is the time when the bull market started and also when i discovered BCN. I did research on every single coin that poloniex offered because i enjoyed it, and BCN was one of the few coins that didnt  catch my attention. BCN had nothing to offer but privacy and i felt like it was kinda losing the race with other coins that had some cool tech to offer (mostly on paper :D but still the concept was much more exciting than BCN). It pumped anyways but if you look at the chart of any coin around may 2017 it was not really a surprise and the fact that it was listed on the biggest exchange during the biggest bull run played its part i belive. What happened next?  Huge dump and if i remember correctly there was some drama with poloneix and BCN but dont remember what it was about. When the price was around 20-30 satoshi i bought some bcn just because i like to gamble sometimes. And this is when i started researching more about the project just to find out that there is no progress at all, they had no devs and i suggested them to implement masternode feature because in my head it was the only reasonable thing they could do to get the buying power again. They considered it and asked me if im a dev but im not and our conversation kinda stopped there.  But then i looked at the chart again and i realized this coin has been around since 2012 and the progress was not really exciting and i decided to sell at the next pump. After that i forgot about that coin and focused more on bittrex and then binance. And now after 1.5 y it got listed on binance which is again one of the biggest exchanges right now but the tech and roadmap still looks really poor to me and i cant even compare bcn to other privacy coins because they are a galaxy ahead. So please tell me whats the reason you guys find this coin attractive? Skipping the fact that it just pumped from 50 sats to 2k sats and then dumped to 100 and i feel like most of the bcn  investors never heard about bcn before it was listed on binance thats why 100 sats actually looks like an attractive price for them.

Thank you

Jul 4, 2014 

Today is July 4th 2014, Independence Day in the USA, but not only that. On July 4th 2012 the very first CryptoNote\-based coin was born. [Bytecoin](http://bytecoin.org/). The very first cryptocoin whose developers were innovative enough to embrace a new technology and put forth the idea of true anonymity. The CN team had recognized the full potential of Bytecoin from the very beginning and provided extensive assistance on the initial stages of development. Therefore we are prone to name July 4th the starting point for all CryptoNote\-based currencies and the day of birth for CN community as a whole. 

The fair distribution of the money supply implemented through egalitarian PoW is something we had intended for the coins based on CN technology and that is what we see in Bytecoin. Looking back over the last two years of its life one can clearly say; Bytecoin is here to stay. We, the CN community, truly appreciate the work of Bytecoin developers who have meticulously followed through with the technology while upholding the CryptoNote philosophy. You never fail to further improve on the technology that rests in your capable hands and the most recent updates along with wallet and node API implementation proves that you are on the right track.

We have the pleasure to congratulate you with your 2nd birthday. We wish you the very bright future, which you certainly deserve. Never lose the sight of your goal and always keep the so much needed passion to achieve it.        

It is on such a noteworthy day that we are thrilled to announce the institution of [CryptoNote Foundation](http://www.cryptonotefoundation.org/). The ultimate goal of the organization is promotion and development of CryptoNote technology in accordance with its long standing philosophy and values. CryptoNote Foundation is meant to bring all the affiliated coins and communities together. The names of the board members are yet to be revealed.

Looks like you’re going up in my Social and Price indexes! ✨

Take a look at it on my analytic [project](https://coinsocialstory.com/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=bytecoin%20checking),  which I’ve been working in my spare time the last few months

Here I rate crypto\-currency by different criteria – such as price, social, development and network.

Every currency has its own page – for example, here is [yours](https://coinsocialstory.com/bytecoin-bcn?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=bytecoin%20personal). ⚡️

For if I want to put the history of each coin in it, here I might need your help!

If you can tell me anything about Bytecoin history, it would be very cool. You can write me here or on my email address [coinsocialstory@gmail.com](mailto:coinsocialstory@gmail.com).

Beyond that, there is still a lot of work to do, so I really want to hear your feedback about the project itself :)

Here is our official response about this:

""We admit that because of the proof of work mechanism it is technically possible to carry out a double-spend attack. All of the coins that have this mechanism have the same risk of being attacked.

Basically the price quoted in the article, $557 for 1 hour of rented Bytecoin hash power is accurate, but as soon as a user or users start to purchase this hash power the price, according to economic rules, begins to rise astronomically. It could be 200-1000 times higher than the price they have listed there and that is only of course, if the hash rate is there to buy in the first place.

After that you have the idea that this is not economically viable. To even consider doing something like this you would need to be a huge stake holder in Bytecoin and as soon as you tried to do any kind of 51% attack the value of your Bytecoin would drop significantly.

On top of this it is extremely risky. If, for example, a user were to attempt some kind of double-spend attack and try to exchange their massive amount of BCN for BTC or ETH on an exchange, the exchange is not going to let that massive amount of money go anywhere unless it is from a verified and trusted account. That means having a user’s address, passport, photo, etc. If somebody were to do something like this they would be almost zero chance of bringing themselves any profit for this.

This is now so thanks to what happened to Bitcoin Gold and Verge, all of the exchanges know what to do when being under the threat of a potential double-spend attack, there are safeguards in place to prevent this from happening again.

Which brings me to my last point,

While we can see here that there is no economic gain for something like this there is a possibility of political gain. A user or group of users could attempt to do something like this in order to try and hurt or to try and destroy Bytecoin.

So what are we planning to do to combat this in the future? We are planning to increase our hashrate and improve our investment attractiveness which should significantly lower any risk to Bytecoin or its community.""

We hope this has answered any questions users have about this situation.

I need a little advice :)
According to the Bytecoin road map posted in Dec 22 2017.
"" The Bytecoin Hardfork will include a new dynamic fee system and deconstruction of the old API. It means that all users should move to the new wallet.
To Back up your old wallet you’ll be able to replace your coins from the old API wallet to the new API wallet""
 
My issue here, i never used bytecoin wallet
i always used freewallet, and i dont know how even to back up my bytecoins, and i have a decent amount of it.
So what is worrying me is that i have my coins in freewallet, will anything happen to them after this decomstructing the old API, or they are safe where they are now ?
what should i do, do i need to download Bytecoin wallet and scratch my head to figure out how to use it and backup my coins, i dont want to mess stuff up, any advice from you guys of what i need to do ?

thanks in advance 
kind regards jerry

ZCash has very good privacy algorithm (even Snowden supports it). The problem is - it’s slow. The algorithm requires more memory (see Bytecoin’s whitepaper). And also, there is a mining tax, which is silly (10% mining reward goes to the developer). However, it will be faster as time goes on - just like other technologies. Plus, ZCash has gained trust from people. Gemini has listed ZCash. 

Bytecoin is a far ahead of Zcash so far. The network has been up and running since 2012. Anonymous transaction by default. No limit on blocksize.  It has also gained trust (listed on Binance). Most of all, Bytecoin is written from a scratch. 

Even though I believe more in Bytecoin, but I think, ZCash is the biggest rival for Bytecoin. Hopefully CryptoNote algorithm will be improved in the future!

Details Inside!","Hi everyone,

We're back with a great new update to AIOMiner! v8.2 is a fairly large update with new features and bug fixes. The push to call this 9.0 was close but 9.0 is already in progress for website integrations.

# [Download AIOMiner v8.2](https://aiominer.com/)

# New Features

- New Colors, in an attempt to get a UI person to come forward, we are using a ...fun color scheme.

- GPU Details are now displayed on AIOMiner! This now shows your the Fan Speed, Temperature, and Utilization of each card.

- Timed Mining - With summer in full force, we have created a Timed Mining setting. This allows for users who pay crazy prices during special times of the day to turn off mining during those hours, and then to start back up when selected.

- E-Mail alerts - To prep our web systems for heavy traffic we are starting off with adding in E-Mail alerts. Start, Stop, Restart Mining and Restarting Rig will all trigger an e-mail. Users will need to confirm their e-mail account, put in code to activate the alarms. You can choose to disable alarms in the same setting where you enabled them. The same EMAIL/CODE is to be used on all of your rigs. This is a temporary EMAIL/CODE until we move over to our ""production"" site.

- Pool Settings will now show a * next to each coin where you have a pool setup
Also, When you go to pool settings, if you have a coin selected in ""Coin to Mine"" it will default to that coins pool as the chances are high you want to edit that coins settings.

- wiki.aiominer.com integration is starting to show, we offer a wiki for each coin by default (we are still building this list), this will allow for users to know where to get a wallet, and any tips for using AIOMiner when mining that coin, be it advanced settings or favorite pools

- Purge miners - You now have the option to purge all of the miners and re-download if your Miners list has been growing

- donation - You can now donate directly to the AIOMiner team via Help-&gt;Donate!

- benchmark - Removed CryptoNight and placed in ZHash. Removed Skunk, placed in Lyra2z. Still following WhatToMine.com

- Miners - Added in support for the new AMD Lyra2REv2 miner. It will auto generate the conf file for you. It is not optimized as the miner is still new, but over time it will be. Right now expect 35-40 MHs for a 480.

# Bug/Fixes

- You can now test a pool with a stratum or http/s in the name.

- When you check for new miners it will now auto download if you have new miners.

- Phoenix Miner would still stay open after a request to stop. Tested/Patched

- Clickable Ad on the Stop is no longer the image but a hotlink, the image will wave the 5 second delay.

- Fixed link for ethermine and ETC.

- Did I mention the colors?

# Expected AMD Lyra2REv2 Hashrates

- VEGA 64 - 75mh/s

- VEGA 56 - 60mh/s

- RX 580 - 42mh/s

- RX 570 - 36mh/s

- RX 560 - 16mh/s

- RX 550 - 8mh/s

- RX 480 - 32mh/s

- R9 280X - 23mh/s

- R9 270 - 13mh/s

- 7970 - 21mh/s

As you know, 'hardfork' can be very dangerous to its network because it means changing network consensus.  Therefore, there is no backward comparability. This brings huge confusion to the daily users.  And I also assume that there will be some kind of 'attack' to Bytecoin network during/after the hardfork.  Maybe the old chain would be still alive, maybe DDOS attack could happen.  I hope the dev team also prepare for those kind of attacks.  And for us, **we will need to upgrade the wallet as soon as possible**.

Plus, I also believe this hardfork should be the first, and the last.  I know it's really hard to expect what's going to happen to Bytecoin in the future (and making bug-free software is very difficult), but hardfork should be the last option when something bad thing happens to Bytecoin network.

To be honest, I feel a little bit disappointed for Bytecoin dev team because the hardfork has been delayed.  It's okay to double check the source code, but the dev team couldn't keep their promise - which is very crucial in the sense of credibility, especially they are anonymous. I really hope that the dev team keep the promise in the future (and I believe they will).

Today, ZCash did hardfork successfully.  Hopefully Bytecoin mining pools and its exchanges, including Binance, will update Bytecoin daemon without any issues in near future.

2018 will be the year of Bytecoin, go Bytecoin team!

Since they’ve re-enabled their [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bytecoin_dev) activity, there are a lot of haters who don’t understand the behavior of the crypto world, price dynamics, and other things which are not related to the development process.


I’d like to ask you if you could support the [Dev Team’s Twitter account](https://twitter.com/bytecoin_dev) with some nice feedback and to help us deal with any negative comments. In this case, our devs would be glad to share more interesting content with the entire crypto community!

I downloaded the wallet and there are three files available.

* walletd
* bytecoind
* bytecoin\-gui

My first guess was to sync the entire blockchain with the daemon (walletd or bytecoind?) and then connect the GUI to it. Didn't work. It always  hangs on disconnected.

How can I connect to my daemon? Is there a guide available? On the official site they talked about 'simplewallet'. I assume this is the CLI file for bytecoin, but I couldn't find a download link.

I also tried to run the GUI as Light Wallet (node.bytecoin.ninja:8081), also without success.

Edit: 

Finally managed to set up the wallet. There was no need to manually start the daemon and connect the GUI to it, I had just to open the GUI and open a wallet.

At this moment the **ByteCoin price prediction** algorithm is forecasting that tomorrow BCN price will be **+28.5%** targeting $0.003742, in 7 days **+32.6%** moving towards $0.003861, in one month **+140.6%** approaching $0.007006 and in 3 months **+82.3%** targeting $0.005309. The Long-term forecast is showing that ByteCoin will be **boosting** in dollar value.

While creating the BCN price prognosis our tool has discovered that for the duration of the last 180 days the upper worth of the coin was **$0.01499**, and the cheapest was **$0.002037**. At this time ByteCoin is in #46 place by market capitalization, having 0.12% total of cryptocurrency capitalization and 0.17% in comparison to the altcoin market.

There are 183987208077 BCN circulating on the market at this point with a total supply of 184467440735. New coins are being created with the PoW mining type based on the CryptoNight algorithm.

What may happen if you decide to **acquire $1000 in BCN now**? The ByteCoin prediction program presumes that within 24 hours the dollar price of your investment may be **$1285**, in 7 days it may be **$1326**, in one month it may be **$2406** and in 3 months it may be **$1823**.

Plus there is an entire ecosystem and the issue with other chains having strong footholds in not only sentiment but market capacity. This team needs to be fucking bold. They need to refine BCN. Stabilize it to where it doesn’t need maintenance like it does now. Then push the fuck out of its selling points. People don’t give a shit about *how* it works. They care about what it can do for them. Inspire people to use it on the basis of anonymity via a streamlined marketing campaign. 

Can BCN make people’s lives easier/better? No? Then move in that direction. If and when it can: harness everything about that and run with it. 

None of this can happen until devs refine the chain. I know devs only care about the protocol itself and its stability and for now, in its current state, we as a community should be taking on this sentiment aswell.

BCN needs its “this is how we can improve your life.” Functionality but it needs bones first. There is a lot of work to be done and for a weak hand this will be an impossible road because it is a long one. 

That’s my two cents right now.

i.e. people are paid in Bytecoin, prices are in BCN, and everyone now uses Bytecoin as a way to store value. 

Assuming that the BCN supply will eventually run dry, and its price will begin to increase dramatically, as time goes by, this is where I see problems arising. 

e.g. 

Prices of goods will fluctuate dramatically to keep up with the changing price of BCN, people won’t want to spend it today because it will be worth more tomorrow, your entire life savings could be worth the world one minute, and nothing the next. 

Has anyone else really thought about this? If so I’d love to hear your thoughts on more possible problems and their solutions.

* 1) Updates are very slow, why is it taking so long.The answer is that developers do not want very little support from outside and their software team is slow. If you think a little big, you have to grow up if you think of being a cripto that supports the whole world.  

* 2)Support the project creators I've written before, announce that you will be awarded or fund them, and attract people here, but you did not. The best project example is 10 million BCN, the second 5 million BCN, the third 3 million BCN.  

* 3)I want to do the project I can not find muhattap, must be a software support team and the environment should be able to get support from them.  

* 4)The price should be very happy people happier developers, Sample TRX is much increased, XVG is much improved but BCN is not growing. You need to do something to increase it. Why not add to bitfinex and bitterex? Transfers take too long When I make the transfer the polonyexden binanceye takes 12 hours but the transfer at XRP takes a maximum of 3 minutes. (I really want to help you softwares, let me solve these situations now)  

* 5)If you were me, I could not sleep, I worked until the morning, I could do this update, I am very curious. People who make transfers between exchanges are in the air, the market rises, BCN does not increase, everyone sells, make friends arrange it as soon as possible!  

* 6)The market is positive BTC is not moving BCN increased by $ 1000, but BCN registered 20% every day when the market is deteriorating. Yes the market is improving but the BCN is not recovering clearly and clearly.  

* 7)I want to help you join your team I am a good 20 year softwareer but you do not even get support from outside.  

* 8)You do not have support, but you can not give it back, so if you go on like this, you go up every 6 months, people are cool with you.  

* 9) Make a statement as soon as possible Yes, I will update within 12 hours Yes, I am 24 hours a day, but let people know.

* I 'm voice to BYTECOIN team;Let's do the project distribution project, the more we use the bytecoin area, the more the value will increase or the game will be in the hands of the whales.
* We are expecting a study in the form of awarding the project. The more usable the project is, the more it is used and the more valuable it becomes.
* I know you do not want your team to get outsider software. But at least let me explain that you will distribute the project award.

Now BCN prise is 0.00000047  BTC Prise is 6740 USD.  
The cheapest coin in BINANCE  
I believe that within 5 months the price of BCN will be 0.00000200 satoshi.

**Please accept Bytecoin only for the smart contract platform ICO.**

And here is explanation:

If Bytecoin team only accepts BCN for the ICO, it will create the actual meaningful usage of Bytecoin as *currency*.  Plus, this will go viral (of course!), so it will give a huge marketing benefit.  And the value of Bytecoin will increase *as the result*.

From the last AMA, Bytecoin team said they hold less than 3&amp;#37; of coins (let's assume this is true lol).  Also, the team said they need to pay other developers to build the smart contract platform.  If Bytecoin team has collected enough BCN during the ICO, then the BCN can be used to pay other developers *who are really interested in Bytecoin* (since the other developers are get paid with Bytecoin - which will be worth a lot more after the ICO).

I believe, in this way, we can create a whole new eco-system top of the Bytecoin network.

I know it's really up to Bytecoin team, but please consider my humble advice.",NA,"8yfhtq",NA,0,NA,"false",1536595514,"false","self","t5_31ues","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/BytecoinBCN/comments/8yfhtq/my_humble_advice_to_increase_bytecoin_usage/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

I always didn't understand Bitcoin maximalist - they are like: *all alt-coins will be dead and only Bitcoin will survive in the future*.  I didn't believe that at all.  Just like there are a lot of languages on the earth, I think people will use all kind of alt-coins.  Of course, one language (cryptocurrency) will be widely used compared to other languages, like English.  Please read this post if you want to know what I'm talking about https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8pl9ny/if_money_is_a_language_bitcoin_is_english/

When I found Bytecoin in my life, I was thrilled.  I was just so fascinated by what they have made.  Their GUI wallet is very intuitive and the mathematics behind the daemon is just an art.  Since then, I tried to find all kind of information about Bytecoin team.  I read all the comments from bitcointalk.org.  One day, I found their old website https://bytecoin.org/old/.  It really reminded me the time when 'warez' teams and hackers are everywhere (i.e. Razor 1911, SKIDROW, newsgroup,  Netbus, Back Orifice, ...) - especially the background music of the old website made me reminiscing about early days of the internet.  And please don't get me wrong, I **always** buy software, this is how I support developers.  Anyway, when I saw their old website, I deeply realized that these guys are real.  These guys seriously care about their privacy.  After that, I didn't care about all the 'pre-mine' scam theories and conspiracies on Bytecoin (and I still believe that they deserve it).  Because I saw their vision - the vision that really will change the world.

You know there is saying: 'If you stare into the Abyss long enough, the Abyss stares back at you'.  I think I dig into Bytecoin long enough.  Of course, I still try to/will try to know about Bytecoin more.  I really hope people will talk about Bytecoin's future, not just price.

Now I understand Bitcoin maximalists - because I have become a Bytecoin maximalist.

Happy birthday, Bytecoin.",NA,"8vx65m",NA,0,NA,"false",1536479629,"false","self","t5_31ues","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/BytecoinBCN/comments/8vx65m/i_think_i_have_become_bytecoin_maximalist/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

No cypto will ever work unless people are willing to actually work for them.

This website will allow our community to post gigs to earn BCN. The marketplace will only accept Bytecoin and will only pay out in bytecoin.  I hoping to have this website complete and ready to operate right after the BCN hardfork is done.

I hoping to get support here so once I launch the website, it would be great if some our members could help support it by place some gigs on the newly created site.

If we can show the rest of the crypto community that people are willing to work for BCN, this could greatly help out our current coin price.

Any feedback would be great and I will keep you all up to date in the development of the site.

Jenny could also post something in her area, commenting on digital marketing, ICO, and so on, linking to the Bytecoin . As you are anonymous, the articles could be signed by Jenny, or by another pseudonym, or even just as Bytecoin . This type of publication contributes to brand consolidation (I think). After that, it's up to the community to translate the articles, each in their own language, and publish on relevant sites like Medium, Steemit, sites of local importance and also on social networks.

The community could also contribute interesting articles that bring useful information about the Bytecoin or more generic articles that briefly mention the Bytecoin (Consideration strategy - Marketing Funnel). Also, it's worth creating the Bytecoin page on Wikipedia and keeping it updated (I did it here, Brazil, and I'm trying to keep it updated).

The publications link could be made publicly available through Reddit, Twitter (share with me @luizmoreiraf) or wherever convenient.

Are they experts, are these people deceived, or someone else? Everything turned out to be banal!
I reviewed a huge number of forums, blogs, publics where there were discussions of our coins Bytecoin, chose accounts of people who write nastiness about Bytecoin and with the help of social engineering and special software found out their profiles in other social networks and Internet services.
After that I found out what these people are interested in, what channels are subscribed to, to whom they put Likes, what articles they write and with whom they communicate!
It turned out that 99 percent of these people are proponents of coins who, by capitalization, compete with Bytecoin every day on the CoinMarketCap! And also of other coins!
Brothers, soon we will be with a sword and riding a horse!
I wanted to write a full article, but then I thought that these people do not deserve my close attention!  
After all, instead of writing good about their favorite coins, they write mucks about other coins!

Hello there; I sent okex and poloniex e 100000 BCH 15 days ago but the deposit was closed.

It's been 15 days and there is still no sound, your price drops from day to day. The volume drops from day to day, but there is still no sound.

* Android and IOS applications still have no reason, writing a program can not be that hard. If you want, can you write an Android wallet wallet in 1 week? How many years have still no android wallets.
* I need a strong partnership, I can not agree with the marketing team. Why is it going so slowly?
* When you are in the market down you say that the market is bad, when the market is good it is also falling bye.

You need a little action, you have to do something.

**Please open the deposits now.**

Hi Jenny and the Developer Team!

I want to write my article for the desktop wallet. Your desktop wallet needs an automatic update. I'm sure many users will support it. Automatic update can be in the form of blocking access to the wallet without updating when the desktop enters the wallet. Or, when you enter your wallet, you can have an update tab next to the help tab and a notification badge. Alternatively, an update section can be created just below the console tab, and a notification badge can be generated when the update occurs. This will be a great convenience both for the network and for many users.

Thousands of users in the community do not want to check into the website to see if updates are available every time they use the desktop wallet. This is both time-consuming and impractical, and users may not want it. Users who have only enough information to use the wallet when they uninstall the old wallet as a program do not know how to get the files in the application data folder, so they have to download every wallet update, download and reinstall the block chain again. Since this is a very annoying situation, automatic updating is now mandatory for many users.

Since this is the case, automatic updating will be a good innovation and convenience for both the user and the network. Please consider evaluating this desire of mine-like users in my community.

I apologize for the inconvenience in Google translation.

Have a nice day! Good luck with! ",NA,"9b7fvi",NA,0,NA,"false",1536822411,"false","self","t5_31ues","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/BytecoinBCN/comments/9b7fvi/about_automatic_updating_of_the_wallet_on_your/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

I think many ppl might facing the same thing and think either something is wrong or lack the patience to wait (I know the feeling). It's important that we all keep on the same page as a community and if ppl start complaining about updates and stuff becouse of impatience that is actually a userbased problem, it will only give BCN unworth bad reputation. On the other hand and if we are not facing a userbased problem, let their team handle it and show off how good they are. I belive in giving cunstructive feedback instead of complains evolve better results for us all. I mean rather than pushing a team back down in their shoes, give them the feedback to work with towards the progression and the goals we all want for this coin is easier achived.

&amp;nbsp;

The app is using **the official API from CoinMarketCap.com**, and here is why you should at least try it:

+ It's a hidden notification, only way to see it is if you drag your notification tab down, you don't even know it's there.

- It's a lot faster than going on coinmarketcap.com.

* It's free and requires no permissions so it's safe.
 
- Can **set Alarms** and it have **Aggressive Alarm mode**(optional) - perfect when you wanna wake up during nights

- Can view prices in BTC/USD/EURO and **other 30 currencies worldwide !!!**

- View notifications for **Top 50 crypto currencies**

- ‎Customize your portfolio and view notifications of **your portfolio stats**

&amp;nbsp;

The reward emission at this time was over 703,000 BCN.    703k multiplied by 153 blocks, is  minimum of 107 Million coins. 

&amp;#x200B;

While this is a very small total of all the BCN, this rate continued for quite a while.  THIS is why folks have a problem with BCN.  

at a minimum SOMEONE needs to explain what happened at the beginning,   I support this coin, I use this coin, and I love the fact it was released on July 4th.

Is there a reason the page is lacking? For one of the more mature currencies, surely we should have a bigger presence on the platform.

TRX for example has a following of 44k on their page. Mostly due to their regular updates and information sharing. 

With a bigger presence, more updates, ease of sharing posts etc, i beleive we can, as a community, spread the word of this great project further afield and strike the interest of those who dont spend too much time seeking out information and doing their own research.

I'd like to discuss about the initial distribution of Bytecoin.  We all know that Bytecoin had been mined about 80% of total coins before the public launch (so called 'premined').  This is a known issue for Bytecoin (that's why Monero was created), and I believe Bytecoin holders have to confront with this issue rather than not talking about it.

.
.

Let's look at Bytecoin as commodity, meaning Bytecoin as product.  The team has created the product 'Bytecoin' which offers the best privacy in the world.  No one has craked its security (yet).  Plus, this product 'Bytecoin' gets better and better over the past 6 years.  Its value also has been increased in the long term.  Now people are worried about 'dump'.  But think about it - if you have large amount of coins AND you are capable of making the system better, would you dump your coins? Or improve the system to increase the value of coins that you hold?

.
.

Let's look at Bytecoin as cash.  If Bytecoin is cash, does it matter that a few people hold large amount of cash?  Let me ask in this way: does it matter when Bill Gates holds large amount of US dollars?

.
.

Now let's think about the distribution issue in Bytecoin.  People criticize Bytecoin because coins are not distributed 'fairly'.  But what is fair?  Does it even exist in the real world?  If you live in 3rd world where you can't access to the internet, and you figure out Bitcoin 10 years from now.  Do you still call Bitcoin distribution is fair?  Don't you think the early adapters, who are willing to take risk, should get more rewards than followers?  Isn't that how things really work in the real world?

.
.

Let's go back to the original question.  Should we look at Bytecoin as commodity or cash?  Satoshi Nakamoto clearly indicated in the whitepaper that: Bitcoin is a P2P electronic 'cash'.  However, people tend to consider Bitcoin as commodity.  Not only just Bitcoin, but also all other crypto currencies, including Bytecoin.  Probably it's because most of coins are listed in crypto-exchanges, and also people don't really use coin in daily life as medium of exchange.

.
.

The answer I have for the quetion is - I don't know.  Maybe the Bytecoin team wants us to look at Bytecoin as cash.  Maybe that's the intention of 'premine'.  However, in my opinion, we cannot categorize cryptocurrency as commodity or cash - because this thing never existed before in human history.  Cryptocurrency is cryptocurrency.

.
.

I hope this post will bring healthy discussion on pre-mine issue in Bytecoin.  I'd like to hear other holder's opinion.",NA,"93u15m",NA,0,NA,"false",1536696165,"false","self","t5_31ues","false","","","false","true",NA,"/r/BytecoinBCN/comments/93u15m/should_we_look_at_bytecoin_as_commodity_or_cash/",NA,"","false","","",0,0

Good tidings, dear users. Many of you heard about one of the most active crypto *exchanges* in the world... Poloniex I mean. It is where my story begins...

**1) Poloniex doesn't keep its promises!**

First of all, I'd like to provide you some information about me. I am a Poloniex user, a legacy one with two factor authentication enabled. On 27 May, two weeks before deadline my account had been frozen. It had been frozen in spite of a promise ""Withdrawals will remain enabled at the daily withdrawal limits prior to the deadline"". I wish to point out that it was an official statement;

**2) Poloniex can keep your coins safe from you!**

When I knew my account had been frozen I had no choice. I had to be verified or leave them my coins. So I preferred to be verified. I've submitted them my government issued documents (they are in Cyrillic but there were no information that only international documents are acceptable) and the only adequate response was: "" The funds will be held safely in your account until the verification process is complete"". The thing is I told them that I cannot get international documents in near future and that I submitted my government issued ones. Now Poloniex is taking of my coins as hostages and urging me to be verified but don't allow me to be verified with my own government issued passport! But Poloniex promises to keep our money safe! Poloniex keeps promises, isn't it?

**3) Poloniex doesn't adhere to its User Agreement in case of it relates to user rights!**

I've spent a lot of time to be verified and nobody ever wanted to help me. Only excuses and promises to keep my money safe. Afterwards I claimed to transfer my coins to my friend's deposit adress. And there was reason to believe they would. There we are: In accordance with article 17 of [User Agreement](https://poloniex.com/terms/) ""You will be permitted to transfer Tokens associated with your Account for ninety (90) days after Account deactivation or cancellation unless such transfer is otherwise prohibited (i) under the law, or (ii) by a valid subpoena or court order."" I've created some more tickets and again no one is ever going to help. They tried to ignore my tickets first, then they started to close them as fast as they could and never ever answered me what is the reason they ignore the [User Agreement](https://poloniex.com/terms/) when it relates to user rights!

P.S. There were a lot of agents I have been talking to: Cole, Daniel, Dean, Edward, Fergus, Homer, Laura, Michelle, Rivero, Sandy etc. There might be someone who'd like to help but anyway I didn't get help so far. Be careful with Poloniex, you wouldn't like it kept your coins safe.

September 10, 2018



A hardfork presents developers of any software product, especially, cryptocurrency, with a rare opportunity to make significant changes to the product. The Bytecoin developers have taken full advantage of this opportunity - version 3.3.0 brings over 60 improvements to various aspects of the product.


Technological Improvements

The most well known feature of the hardfork release is dynamic fees. Previously the fee was dynamic only in part: it was proportional to the size of the TX, but not lower than 0.01 BCN. After the hardfork this limitation is eliminated: the fee can go down to 0. The only thing to keep in mind is that the fee is a market instrument - the higher the fee, the more likely the miner would pick a TX first.

There is another thing that is useful to keep in mind about the fees. Some people think that the size of the TX depends on the amount that they send, which is not completely true. The size of the TX depends on the granularity of previous outputs associated with the address. The smaller the outputs, the greater number of them is required to make up the TX, and the larger the body of that TX. On rare occasions the size of the TX can even be too large to fit in a block. Fortunately, this issue has an ingenuous workaround: send this amount in several smaller TXs.Seed nodes are now contacted approximately once per day. This feature greatly helps to catch up after bytecoind is started for users who run it after a delay of several weeks or more.An important fix, that prevents ignoring the external port on a peer handshake. It has made connections through exposed non-standard ports to nodes behind NATs, which was impossible before.Groestl hash function and Keccakpermutation function, two very important components of cryptography which Bytecoin is built on, have been updated from their sources.Now the Bytecoin daemons warn users that inprocess bytecoind is deprecated and will be removed soon. This peculiarity is important to prevent bytecoind P2P attack vectors from reaching a walletd address space where wallet keys reside.Long JSON-RPC calls, the language structure that API communication is facilitated with, are now up to 2 times faster.15 response and request objects have been deprecated or changed to convey the meaning of objects they describe better.This version enables the daemon CLI-parameter for the long sought-after test-and stage- nets. Testnet is an infrastructure that allows for easy local blockchain deployment on the integrator’s hardware for easy initial testing of the software. Unlike the testnet, stagenet is a global infrastructure that almost completely mimics the mainnet and is supposed to be taken advantage of on later stages of development. The testnet time multiplier can now be set to speed up all processes 10x, 100x, or even more.When participating in the testnet or stagenet, bytecoind now uses UDP Multicast to announce/discover other bytecoind nodes in the local network. Thus in most local networks the testnet will self-assemble without seed nodes.


The smooth Hardfork

The hardfork process is designed to be as smooth and unintrusive as possible. When 90% of blocks in a 24-hour time frame would be submitted by the new version, the hardfork would be automatically scheduled to happen in 14 days (or 10 000 blocks). This allows most users and partners to be aware of the network conditions and gives them enough time to update to the latest version.


Usable API

Exchanges, partners and miners are a very important part of Bytecoin’s infrastructure. It is in part thanks to them that Bytecoin is now what it is.

The Bytecoin developers value their contribution to the success of the project and have taken expert care of the instruments they use during the integration and maintenance processes.

The new version brings much better error handling and more specific error codes. This makes troubleshooting an easier and faster process.

Binary methods now share single access point /binary_rpc. This addition streamlines the Bytecoin API structure.

The new “Paranoid mode” checks every byte of blockchain when downloading and is designed for especially concerned users or for testing purposes.

Now any field in requests that daemons do not understand will be reported as an error. This allows to bring order and eliminate uncertainty in the API querying process as well as reduce traffic.

In methods supporting longpoll (get_statusand get_block_template) all longpoll arguments are now optional. Changes to fields that were not requested will not trigger response to longpoll.

The new get_wallet_info method fetches the most important info about the wallet. get_statistics response now includes much more information

Opening remarks
Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency among thousands of other cryptocurrency coins, but the fact is much lesser known among the people that Bitcoin is not the best cryptocurrency in terms of efficiency as well as worldwide acceptance, as demons of scalability as well as security haunt it. Nevertheless, when Bitcoin was initiated in the year 2009, it was highly reliable, as no other cryptocurrencies were able to replicate the working mechanism or the robustness provided by it. But as times have passed by, significant advancements have been made within the cryptocurrency domain also, which has, in turn, lead to the inception and development of better cryptocurrencies than Bitcoin too. Let us read about one such cryptocurrency: Bytecoin.

Bytecoin: The untraceable one
In a nutshell, the Blockchain technology which is the actual working model behind all the cryptocurrencies must be adopted in each and every domain possible, in order to enhance their productivity. Bytecoin was one such cryptocurrency coin developed in 2012, with some of the most advanced as well as new features making it one of the best cryptocurrencies of today’s time. In this article, we’ll list some of the key attributes which make Bytecoin the way it is.

1. Bytecoin is one among the many other cryptocurrency coins which are endorsed as the most reliable, secure, as well as robust cryptocurrency coin.

2. The community and also released a beta version of its high load resistance to which the users can be a part of. This particular update will precisely assist the community members to improve the future scalability or any other issues that can occur within the Bytecoin network.

3. The Bytecoin is also available on one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges OKEx from July 2018 itself. This is one of the major Milestone on the roadmap of the cryptocurrency field. According to the experts within the Bytecoin community, this adoption will open up opportunities for a widespread acceptance of Bytecoin as the Crypto exchanges are one of the highly reliable ones.

4. Its acceptance and popularity can be put forth by incorporating statistics into the picture, within a span of 24 hours, the cryptocurrency coin who’s daily trading volume was around 8 million dollars spiked to 600 million dollars writing.

5. Another hard fork from the cryptocurrency coin is expected to undertook on 31st August 2018. All the Bitcoin users, miners, as well as the community members, are highly advised to update the cryptocurrency coin through this hard work with a version number 3.3.

6. This particular update of Bytecoin has removed the lower margin of minimum fees that were required for each and every transaction. The Transaction fees earlier were proportional to the transaction amount and the trend would continue in this update also.

7. Keeping the decentralization of mining process in mind, the team members at Bytecoin have adopted the compatibility of Bytecoin mining through the ASIC miners also, that can also support CPUs as well as GPUs in order to mine Bytecoin.

8. Despite various scandals and cryptocurrency regulations within the Asian market, the Bytecoin community has certainly been able to enter into the market along with keeping its previous connections with various countries intact.

9. Countries like China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, etc have been only some of the many countries which have openly adopted the Bytecoin within its cryptocurrency domain.

10. Much other privacy-focused cryptocurrency coins like Monero were kind of extracted from Bytecoin itself.

11. At some point in time, the Bytecoin network experienced huge amounts of network influx due to the features of the private and untraceable Bytecoin. The congestion was so intense that the community tweeted to its users to avoid any kind of Bytecoin Transactions until they have completely resolved the issue.

12. Also regarded as “ father of Monero”, the cryptocurrency coin holders have an amazing future ahead as the adoption of Bytecoin is consistently being observed to be increasing.

13. Recently, in August 2018, the Bytecoin community also released their official cryptocurrency Android wallet which forms one of the most secure forms of cryptocurrency wallet until now.

14, Also, in the same month, its Public testnet release was initiated which marks one of the most important events in the history of Bytecoin.

15. In order to provide an engaging and attractive user experience, the community members have even decided to upgrade their Web-based Bytecoin wallet, keeping the requirements of its community members in mind.

Is this due to the HF? Anyone else has the same problem?  


**EDIT**  
u/mcrexx666's advice worked for me. I deleted everything in the ..\appdata\roaming\bytecoin\ folder (except the wallet files), after that the wallet found peers and started syncing as normal. 

If you have the same problem and follow this advice, please be sure you do not delete your wallet files, even better make backup copies of them before you do anything.

You might also consider downloading the blockchain since otherwise the syncing will take ages.",NA,"9cldpa",NA,0,NA,"false",1540068616,"false","self","t5_31ues",NA,"","","false","true",NA,"/r/BytecoinBCN/comments/9cldpa/330_not_syncing/",NA,"","false","","",0,0
